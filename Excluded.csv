Specific contributions of various muscle fibre types to human muscle performance: an in vitro study.,Bottinelli R; Pellegrino MA; Canepari M; Rossi R; Reggiani C,"Human skeletal muscle fibres can be divided in five groups: 1, 1-2A, 2A, 2A-2B and 2B, by using myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms as molecular markers. This study aimed to define the contribution of each fibre type to the contractile performance of human muscles. Single fibre segments were dissected from bioptic samples of vastus lateralis and chemically skinned. Force-velocity properties, including isometric tension (P0), maximal shortening velocity (Vmax), maximum power output (Wmax) and the velocity at which Wmax is reached (Vopt), were determined at maximum calcium activation. Among these parameters Wmax showed the largest range of variation: about nine times between 2B and slow fibres. Vopt also showed large (about four times) and significant variations between fibre types. Force development at submaximum calcium activation was studied and force-pCa curves were obtained for each fibre type. Calcium sensitivity was greater in 2B than in 2A and in slow fibres. The slope of the force-pCa curve was greater in fast than in slow fibres. At the end of the experiment the MHC isoform composition of each fibre segment was determined by gel electrophoresis. The functional properties of each fibre type are discussed in the light of the motor unit recruitment mechanism to understand their possible physiological role.",1999,Apr,J Electromyogr Kinesiol,9,2,87-95,,10.1016/s1050-6411(98)00040-6,10098709,#2660,Bottinelli 1999,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Post-operative effects on insulin resistance and specific tension of single human skeletal muscle fibres.,Degens H; Soop M; Höök P; Ljungqvist O; Larsson L,"Surgery and accidental trauma are associated with a transient period of insulin resistance, substrate catabolism and muscle weakness. In the present study, we evaluated the changes in the force-generating capacity of chemically skinned single muscle fibres following abdominal surgery. Biopsies of the m. vastus lateralis were obtained in three patients 1 day before and 3 or 6 days after surgery. Part of the biopsy was frozen for histochemical analysis of the fibre cross-sectional area (FCSA) and myofibrillar protein content, and another part was used for single-fibre contractile measurements. All patients developed insulin resistance following surgery. The maximum velocity of unloaded shortening of single muscle fibres did not change following surgery. The FCSA did not decrease after surgery, as determined either from histochemical sections or from single fibres measured at a fixed sarcomere length of 2.76+/-0.09 microm (mean+/-S.D.). Further, the force-generating capacity of the single fibres, measured as maximal Ca(2+)-activated force (P(0)) or as P(0) normalized to FCSA (specific tension), remained unchanged, as did the myofibrillar protein content of the muscle. In conclusion, the muscle weakness associated with post-operative insulin resistance is not related to a decreased specific tension or a loss of myofibrillar proteins. Other potential cellular mechanisms underlying post-operative weakness are discussed.",1999,Oct,Clin Sci (Lond),97,4,449-55,,10.1042/cs0970449,10491345,#2670,Degens 1999,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Specific tension of human elbow flexor muscles.,Edgerton VR; Apor P; Roy RR,"Human muscle has a specific tension that is similar to that of other mammalian skeletal muscle.

Training-induced changes in muscle architecture and specific tension.,Kawakami Y; Abe T; Kuno SY; Fukunaga T,"Five men underwent unilateral resistance training of elbow extensor (triceps brachii) muscles for 16 weeks. Before and after training, muscle layer thickness and fascicle angles of the long head of the triceps muscle were measured in vivo using B-mode ultrasound, and fascicle lengths were estimated. Series anatomical cross-sectional areas (ACSA) of the triceps brachii muscle were measured by magnetic resonance imaging, from which muscle volume (Vm) was determined and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was calculated. Elbow extension strength (isometric; concentric and eccentric at 30, 90 and 180 degrees.s-1) was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer to determine specific tension. Muscle volumes, ACSA, PCSA, muscle layer thickness and fascicle angles increased after training and their relative changes were similar, while muscle and fascicle length did not change. Muscle strength increased at all velocities; however, specific tension decreased after training. Increase in fascicle angles, which would be the result of increased Vm and PCSA, would seem to imply the occurrence of changes in muscle architecture. This might have given a negative effect on the force-generating properties of the muscles.",1995,,Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol,72,2-Jan,37-43,,10.1007/BF00964112,8789568,#2679,Kawakami 1995,Exclusion reason: Specific tension value not reported; ,Whole muscle,ST calculation error,,,,,,,,
Mechanical properties of young and elderly human muscle.,Davies CT; Thomas DO; White MJ,"The electrically evoked isometric properties of the triceps surae have been studied in young (22 yr) and elderly (69 yr) men and women. The results show that the triceps surae of elderly subjects had an increased time to peak tension (TPT) of the twitch, a lower specific tension (force/cross section area), and showed a greater relative force loss when subjected to a standard ""fatigue"" test procedure than young triceps surae. The respective figures for TPT, specific tension, and fatigue index (FI) were 147 +/- 15 ms (male), 143 +/- 8 ms (female), 19.5 N/cm2 and 0.52 +/- 0.16 (male), 0.37 +/- 0.09 (female) in the elderly, compared with 118 +/- 14 ms (male), 132 +/- 11 ms (female), 32.9 N/cm2 and 0.67 +/- 0.11 (male), 0.62 +/- 0.09 (female) in their younger counterparts. The peak rates of rise (delta P50, delta P200) and relaxation (delta PR50, delta PR200) of tetani at 50 Hz and 200 Hz were slower (p less than 0.05) in the elderly group. The delta P50 and delta P200 were inversely associated (r = 0.76 and -0.50 respectively) with TPT, and the half relaxation time (1/2RT) of the maximal twitch was related to delta PR50 (r = 0.53). The decrease of tetanus relaxation rate during the 2 min fatigue test (delta PRF) was greater in the elderly than the young and was positively associated (r = 0.74) with FI. It is concluded that elderly muscle is weaker, more slowly contracting and fatigable than that of the young. However, it is suggested that the reduced specific tension and enhanced fatiguability of the elderly may in part be due respectively to the inadequacies of our estimates of the effective cross-sectional area CSA) of contractile tissue in the lower leg and the influence of blood flow which may be compromised during a 2 min test.",1986,,Acta Med Scand Suppl,711,,219-26,,10.1111/j.0954-6820.1986.tb08954.x,3465206,#2684,Davies 1986,Exclusion reason: PCSA not directly measured; ,,PCSA taken from literature,,,,,,,,
Effects of ageing and gender on contractile properties in human skeletal muscle and single fibres.,Yu F; Hedström M; Cristea A; Dalén N; Larsson L,"AIM: The objective of this study is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the ageing- and gender-related muscle weakness. METHODS: Ageing- and gender-related differences in regulation of muscle contraction have been studied in knee-extensor muscles at the whole muscle and single muscle fibre levels in young and old sedentary men and women. In vivo knee-extensor muscle function was measured at slow (30 degrees s(-1)) and faster (180 degrees s(-1)) speeds of movement. Maximum velocity of unloaded shortening (V(0)) and maximum force normalized to cross-sectional area (CSA) [specific tension (ST)] were measured in single 'skinned' skeletal muscle fibre segments. RESULTS: Significant ageing- and gender-related differences were observed in muscle torque. A 33-55% ageing-related decline (P < 0.001) in maximum torque was observed irrespective of gender. At the single muscle fibre level, the ageing-related decline in knee-extensor muscle function was accompanied by a 20-28% decline in ST in muscle fibres expressing the type I MyHC isoform in both men and women, and a 29% decline in type IIa muscle fibre CSA, but the decreased fast-twitch fibre size was restricted to the men. Furthermore, in both men and women, V(0) decreased in muscle cells expressing the type I and IIa MyHC isoforms. CONCLUSION: The present results provide evidence of specific ageing- and gender-related differences in regulation of muscle contraction at the cellular level. It is suggested that these cellular changes have a significant impact on muscle function and the ageing-related motor handicap.",2007,Jul,Acta Physiol (Oxf),190,3,229-41,,10.1111/j.1748-1716.2007.01699.x,17581136,#2685,Yu 2007,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Are muscle fibres of body builders intrinsically weaker? A comparison with single fibres of aged-matched controls.,Monti E; Toniolo L; Marcucci L; Bondì M; Martellato I; Šimunič B; Toninello P; Franchi MV; Narici MV; Reggiani C,"AIM: Skeletal muscles of Body Builders (BB) represent an interesting model to study muscle mass gains in response to high volume resistance training. It is debated whether muscle contractile performance improves in proportion to mass. Here, we aim to assess whether muscle hypertrophy does not occur at the expense of performance. METHODS: Six BB and Six untrained controls (CTRL) were recruited. Cross-sectional area (CSA) and maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of quadriceps femoris muscle (QF) and CSA and architecture of vastus lateralis (VL) were determined. Moreover, a biopsy was taken from VL mid-portion and single fibres were analysed. RESULTS: QF CSA and MVC were 32% (n.s., P = .052) and 58% (P = .009) higher in BB than in CTRL, respectively. VL CSA was 37% higher in BB (P = .030). Fast 2A fibres CSA was 24% (P = .048) greater in BB than in CTRL, when determined in immunostained sections of biopsy samples. Single permeabilized fast fibres CSA was 37% (n.s., P = .052) higher in BB than in CTRL, and their force was slightly higher in BB (n.s.), while specific tension (P(0) ) was 19% (P = .024) lower. The lower P(0) was not explained either by lower myosin content or by impaired calcium diffusion. Conversely, the swelling caused by skinning-induced permeabilization was different and, when used to correct P(0) , differences between populations disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that high degree of muscle hypertrophy is not detrimental for force generation capacity, as increases in fibre size and force are strictly proportional once the differential swelling response is accounted for.",2021,Feb,Acta Physiol (Oxf),231,2,e13557,,10.1111/apha.13557,32921001,#2699,Monti 2021,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Effects of removal of weight-bearing function on contractility and myosin isoform composition in single human skeletal muscle cells.,Larsson L; Li X; Berg HE; Frontera WR,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 6-week period without weight bearing, achieved by bed rest, on the contractile behaviour, myosin isoform expression and myofibrillar protein content of single human muscle fibres. Percutaneous biopsied specimens of the quadriceps muscle were taken from three healthy male volunteers before and at the end of the experimental period. Maximum force normalised to cross-sectional area (specific tension), maximum velocity of unloaded shortening (V0), and myosin heavy chain (MyHC) and light chain (MyLC) isoform composition were measured in single membrane-permeabilised muscle cells obtained from these specimens. At the end of the experimental period, specific tension was reduced (P < 0.001) by 40% and there was a parallel decline in myofibrillar protein content per muscle cell volume. V0 did not change significantly in response to bed rest when data from all muscle cells were pooled. In two of the subjects, however, V0 decreased (P < 0.01-0.001) in muscle cells expressing the beta/slow (type I) MyHC isoform, but there was no change in fibres expressing type IIA or a combination of type IIA and IIB MyHCs. The slowing in type I MyHC fibres was associated with a change in the isoform composition of the regulatory MyLC.",1996,Jun,Pflugers Arch,432,2,320-8,,10.1007/s004240050139,8662283,#2702,Larsson 1996,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
"Contractile studies of single human skeletal muscle fibers: a comparison of different muscles, permeabilization procedures, and storage techniques.",Frontera WR; Larsson L,"The study of single muscle fibers has improved our understanding of muscle physiology and pathology. To compare three techniques for fiber preparation and storage, biopsies were obtained from the tibialis anterior and vastus lateralis muscles of a hemiparetic patient and a control subject. Single fibers were prepared with: (1) chemical skinning (CS) and storage at -20 degrees C; (2) chemical skinning followed by sucrose (SU) incubation and storage at -80 degrees C; or (3) freeze-drying (FD) and -80 degrees C storage. Cross-sectional area (CSA), resting, maximal (P0), and specific tension (P0/CSA), and maximum shortening velocity (V0) were determined in 189 cells. CSA was similar in all groups. Resting tension was higher and P0 and P0/CSA lower after FD. In general, V0 was the same in all groups. Our data suggest that CS and SU preserve the properties of single muscle fibers better than FD. SU may allow longer storage of fibers.",1997,Aug,Muscle Nerve,20,8,948-52,,10.1002/(sici)1097-4598(199708)20:8<948::aid-mus3>3.0.co;2-6,9236784,#2712,Frontera 1997,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Evidence that maximum muscle stress is not a constant: differences in specific tension in elbow flexors and extensors.,Buchanan TS,"The specific tension of muscle (or maximum muscle stress) is the maximum force developed per unit cross-sectional area and is a frequently used parameter by investigators estimating muscle force. Generally, it is assumed to be a constant value for all muscles and, when multiplied by a muscle's cross-sectional area, is used to provide a measure of a muscle's maximum force production. In this study, the specific tension for elbow flexors and for extensors were compared to evaluate the validity of this assumption. Maximum muscle stress was determined using maximum joint moments measured as a function of joint angle and using anatomical parameters reported in the literature. It was observed that the specific tension for elbow flexors was considerably larger than for extensors when measured a variety of ways. The exact reasons for the differences are unknown, but variations in specific tension of individual fibers may play a role. It was concluded that the use of a constant value for specific tension in muscle models is questionable in studies that demand accurate results.",1995,Oct,Med Eng Phys,17,7,529-36,,10.1016/1350-4533(95)00005-8,7489126,#2718,Buchanan 1995,Exclusion reason: PCSA not directly measured; ,,PCSA taken from literature,,,,,,,,
A musculotendon model of the fatigue profiles of paralyzed quadriceps muscle under FES.,Giat Y; Mizrahi J; Levy M,"In a previous work, we studied the mechanical and the metabolic profiles of fatigue of paralyzed quadriceps muscle under activation by FES. The metabolic state of the muscle during stimulation of paraplegic patients was monitored, simultaneously with the decaying force, by using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the present work, a musculotendon model was developed to enable prediction of the force output during continuous electrical stimulation. The model consisted of five elements, including the tendon, the parallel elastic, contractile and damper muscle elements, as well as the muscle mass. The mechanism of the contractile element was based upon the length-tension and the velocity-tension curves, the activation trajectory, and the experimentally obtained relationship between force and intracellular pH. In the equations obtained, three sets of parameters were used: 1) general muscle parameters, associated with the length-tension curves of tendon, fascia, and muscle and the velocity-tension curve of the contractile element; 2) specific anthropometric parameters of the muscle; and 3) fatigue parameters which were obtained from our previously recorded experimental data. The model was formulated to allow prediction of the quadriceps muscle force under dynamic activation and at various levels of stimulation. The model solution was for isometric contraction in supermaximal stimulation, and it provided the force decaying profiles, which were compared to those obtained experimentally. The parameters yielding the best fit between the model and the experimental results were indicated. Particularly, two muscle nonspecific parameters, namely, the muscle stress parameter and the parameter representing the ratio between the muscle's slack length and its length in vivo at various knee angles, were determined using the model. The muscle stress parameter was found to be between 60 and 64 N/cm2, and the length ratio was 0.952, 0.935, 0.920, and 0.901 for the 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees knee angle, respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted of the model to perturbations of these two estimated parameters, revealing that the model was sensitive to these parameters.",1993,Jul,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,40,7,664-74,,10.1109/10.237696,8244427,#2787,Giat 1993,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,,Unhealthy muscle,,,,,,,,
Musculoskeletal adaptations to strength training in frail elderly: a matter of quantity or quality?,Aas SN; Breit M; Karsrud S; Aase OJ; Rognlien SH; Cumming KT; Reggiani C; Seynnes O; Rossi AP; Toniolo L; Raastad T,"BACKGROUND: The improvement in muscle strength generally exceeds the increase in muscle size following strength training in frail elderly, highlighting the complex aetiology of strength deficit in aging. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of heavy-load strength training on a broad number of factors related to specific strength in frail elderly. METHODS: Thirty-four frail elderly men (n = 18) and women (n = 16) aged 67 to 98 (86 ± 7 years) were randomized to either a group performing strength training twice a week for 10 weeks (ST) or a non-exercising control group (CON). Knee extensor muscle strength was tested as one-repetition maximum (1RM) and isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque. Muscle activation was assessed by the interpolated twitch technique, and muscle density [mean Hounsfield units (HU)] and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) by computed tomography scans of the quadriceps femoris. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis were obtained to investigate changes in intramyocellular lipids and single-fibre specific tension. RESULTS: In ST, knee extension 1RM and MVC improved by 17 and 7%, respectively. Muscle cross-sectional area of the quadriceps femoris increased by 7%, accompanied by a 4% increase of muscle density. No changes in IMAT, voluntary activation level, single-fibre specific tension, or lipid content were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to several previous reports, the improvements in isometric muscle strength and muscle area were in good agreement in the present study. The training-induced increase in muscle density was not due to changes in skeletal muscle lipid content. Instead, the increase in muscle density may reflect increased packing of contractile material or simply an increased ratio of muscle tissue relative to IMAT.",2020,Jun,J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle,11,3,663-677,,10.1002/jcsm.12543,32091670,#2824,Aas 2020,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
"Single muscle fibre contractile properties differ between body-builders, power athletes and control subjects.",Meijer JP; Jaspers RT; Rittweger J; Seynnes OR; Kamandulis S; Brazaitis M; Skurvydas A; Pišot R; Šimunič B; Narici MV; Degens H,"What is the central question of this study? Do the contractile properties of single muscle fibres differ between body-builders, power athletes and control subjects? What is the main finding and its importance? Peak power normalized for muscle fibre volume in power athletes is higher than in control subjects. Compared with control subjects, maximal isometric tension (normalized for muscle fibre cross-sectional area) is lower in body-builders. Although this difference may be caused in part by an apparent negative effect of hypertrophy, these results indicate that the training history of power athletes may increase muscle fibre quality, whereas body-building may be detrimental. We compared muscle fibre contractile properties of biopsies taken from the vastus lateralis of 12 body-builders (BBs; low- to moderate-intensity high-volume resistance training), six power athletes (PAs; high-intensity, low-volume combined with aerobic training) and 14 control subjects (Cs). Maximal isotonic contractions were performed in single muscle fibres, typed with SDS-PAGE. Fibre cross-sectional area was 67 and 88% (P < 0.01) larger in BBs than in PAs and Cs, respectively, with no significant difference in fibre cross-sectional area between PAs and Cs. Fibres of BBs and PAs developed a higher maximal isometric tension (32 and 50%, respectively, P < 0.01) than those of Cs. The specific tension of BB fibres was 62 and 41% lower than that of PA and C fibres (P < 0.05), respectively. Irrespective of fibre type, the peak power (PP) of PA fibres was 58% higher than that of BB fibres (P < 0.05), whereas BB fibres, despite considerable hypertrophy, had similar PP to the C fibres. This work suggests that high-intensity, low-volume resistance training with aerobic exercise improves PP, while low- to moderate-intensity high-volume resistance training does not affect PP and results in a reduction in specific tension. We postulate that the decrease in specific tension is caused by differences in myofibrillar density and/or post-translational modifications of contractile proteins.",2015,Nov,Exp Physiol,100,11,1331-41,,10.1113/EP085267,26388513,#2847,Meijer 2015,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Resistance training induced changes in strength and specific force at the fiber and whole muscle level: a meta-analysis.,Dankel SJ; Kang M; Abe T; Loenneke JP,"PURPOSE: Considerable debate exists as to whether increases in strength that occur with resistance exercise are the result of increases in muscle size. Most studies have attempted to answer this question using assessments of whole muscle size and voluntary muscle strength, but examining changes at the individual muscle fiber level may also provide some insight. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to compare adaptations at the whole muscle and individual fiber level. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted in February, 2018 including all previously published papers and was analyzed using a random effects model. RESULTS: There were no differences (p = 0.88) when comparing hypertrophy at the whole muscle (4.6%) and individual fiber level (7.0%), but significantly larger (p < 0.001) strength gains were observed at the whole muscle level (43.3%) relative to the individual fiber (19.5%). Additionally, there was an increase in the specific tension of type 1 muscle fibers (p = 0.013), but not type 2 muscle fibers (p = 0.23) which was driven by similar increases in strength (type 1: 17.5%, type 2A: 17.7%), despite differences in muscle size (type 1: 6.7%, type 2A: 12.1%). CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that the neural adaptations play a large role in increasing isotonic whole muscle strength, but also demonstrate that an improvement in specific tension of type 1 muscle fibers is present. These results would suggest that some mechanism intrinsic to the muscle fiber, and independent of muscle growth, may also be contributing to strength increases in response to resistance exercise providing an avenue for future research.",2019,Jan,Eur J Appl Physiol,119,1,265-278,,10.1007/s00421-018-4022-9,30357517,#2853,Dankel 2019,Exclusion reason: meta analysis; ,,Review study,,,,,,,,
Echo intensity is negatively associated with functional capacity in older women.,Rech A; Radaelli R; Goltz FR; da Rosa LH; Schneider CD; Pinto RS,"Muscle quality is an important component of the functional profile of the elderly, and previous studies have shown that both muscle quantity and quality independently contribute to muscle strength of the elderly. This study aimed to verify the association between quadriceps femoris muscle quality, analyzed by specific tension and echo intensity (EI), and rate of torque development (RTD) of the knee extensor muscles with the functional performance in elderly active women. Forty-five healthy, active elderly women (70.28 ± 6.2) volunteered to participate in this study. Quadriceps femoris muscle thickness and EI were determined by ultrasonography. Knee extension isometric peak torque and RTD were obtained from maximal isometric voluntary contraction curves. The 30-s sit-to-stand-up (30SS) test and usual gait speed (UGS) test were applied to evaluate functional performance. Rectus femoris EI presented a significant negative correlation with 30SS (r = -0.505, P < 0.01), UGS (r s = -0.347, P < 0.05), and isometric peak torque (r = -0.314, P < 0.05). The quadriceps femoris EI correlated negatively with 30SS (r = -0.493, P < 0.01) and isometric peak torque (r = -0.409, P < 0.01). The EI of the quadriceps femoris and all quadriceps muscle portions significantly correlated with RTD. RTD significantly correlated with physical performance in both functional tests (30SS = r = 0.340, P < 0.05; UGS = r s = 0.371, P < 0.05). We concluded that muscle EI may be an important predictor of functional performance and knee extensor power capacity in elderly, active women.",2014,,Age (Dordr),36,5,9708,,10.1007/s11357-014-9708-2,25167965,#2865,Rech 2014,Exclusion reason: Torque/PCSA reported instead of specific tension (F/PCSA) value reported; ,,ST value not reported (torque/ QF muscle thickness),,,,,,,,
Effect of age on muscle hypertrophy induced by resistance training.,Welle S; Totterman S; Thornton C,"BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that resistance training induces muscle hypertrophy in older subjects, but has not clarified whether the degree of hypertrophy is affected by age. The present study was done to test the hypothesis that men and women over 60 years old have a smaller hypertrophic response to resistance training than young adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of muscle in the thigh and upper arm were determined before and after 3 months of progressive resistance training by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 9 young (22-31 yr, 5 male and 4 female) and 8 old (62-72 yr, 4 male and 4 female) subjects. Strength was determined by 3-repetition-maximum (3RM) testing. The amount of weight lifted during the training program was proportional to baseline strength. RESULTS: Mean pretraining 3RM strength, per cm2 CSA, was less in the older group for all muscle groups examined (16 +/- 6% for elbow flexors, p < .02; 40 +/- 7% for knee flexors, p < .001; 19 +/- 9% for knee extensors, p < .05). Mean training-induced increases in muscle CSA were less in the older group for elbow flexors (22 +/- 4% in young, 9 +/- 4% in old, p < .05) and knee flexors (8 +/- 2% in young, 1 +/- 2% in old, p < .01), but not for knee extensors (4 +/- 1% in young, 6 +/- 2% in old). Mean training-induced increases in specific tension (ratio of 3RM strength to CSA) were similar in young and old groups for elbow flexors (21 +/- 5% in young, 19 +/- 5% in old) and knee extensors (38 +/- 6% in young, 32 +/- 14% in old), but were greater in the older group for knee flexors (28 +/- 5% in young, 64 +/- 13% in old, p < .02). CONCLUSIONS: Aging can attenuate the hypertrophic response of muscle groups to resistance training, when the training load is proportional to baseline strength. However, aging does not impair training-induced increases in specific tension.",1996,Nov,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,51,6,M270-5,,10.1093/gerona/51a.6.m270,8914498,#2878,Welle 1996,Exclusion reason: Wrong outcomes; ,,"ST value not reported (3RM/ CSA for  KF,KE,EF)",,,,,,,,
Effects of combined strength and sprint training on regulation of muscle contraction at the whole-muscle and single-fibre levels in elite master sprinters.,Cristea A; Korhonen MT; Häkkinen K; Mero A; Alén M; Sipilä S; Viitasalo JT; Koljonen MJ; Suominen H; Larsson L,"AIM: This study aims at examining the effects of progressive strength and sprint training on regulation of muscle contraction at the whole-muscle and single-fibre levels in older sprint-trained athletes. METHODS: Eleven men (52-78 years) were randomized to a training (EX, n = 7) or control (CTRL, n = 4) group. EX participated in a 20-week programme that combined sprint training with heavy and explosive strength exercises, while CTRL maintained their usual run-based training schedules. RESULTS: EX improved maximal isometric and dynamic leg strength, explosive jump performance and force production in running. Specific tension and maximum shortening velocity of single fibres from the vastus lateralis were not altered in EX or CTRL. Fibre type and myosin heavy chain isoform distributions remained unchanged in the two groups. There was a general increase in fibre areas in EX, but this was significant only in IIa fibres. The 10% increase in squat jump in EX was accompanied by a 9% increase in the integrated EMG (iEMG) of the leg extensors but the 21-40% increases in isometric and dynamic strength were not paralleled by changes in iEMG.

"Aging, muscle fiber type, and contractile function in sprint-trained athletes.",Korhonen MT; Cristea A; Alén M; Häkkinen K; Sipilä S; Mero A; Viitasalo JT; Larsson L; Suominen H,"Biopsy samples were taken from the vastus lateralis of 18- to 84-yr-old male sprinters (n = 91). Fiber-type distribution, cross-sectional area, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform content were identified using ATPase histochemistry and SDS-PAGE. Specific tension and maximum shortening velocity (V(o)) were determined in 144 single skinned fibers from younger (18-33 yr, n = 8) and older (53-77 yr, n = 9) runners. Force-time characteristics of the knee extensors were determined by using isometric contraction. The cross-sectional area of type I fibers was unchanged with age, whereas that of type II fibers was reduced (P < 0.001). With age there was an increased MHC I (P < 0.01) and reduced MHC IIx isoform content (P < 0.05) but no differences in MHC IIa. Specific tension of type I and IIa MHC fibers did not differ between younger and older subjects. V(o) of fibers expressing type I MHC was lower (P < 0.05) in older than in younger subjects, but there was no difference in V(o) of type IIa MHC fibers. An aging-related decline of maximal isometric force (P < 0.001) and normalized rate of force development (P < 0.05) of knee extensors was observed. Normalized rate of force development was positively associated with MHC II (P < 0.05). The sprint-trained athletes experienced the typical aging-related reduction in the size of fast fibers, a shift toward a slower MHC isoform profile, and a lower V(o) of type I MHC fibers, which played a role in the decline in explosive force production. However, the muscle characteristics were preserved at a high level in the oldest runners, underlining the favorable impact of sprint exercise on aging muscle.",2006,Sep,J Appl Physiol (1985),101,3,906-17,,10.1152/japplphysiol.00299.2006,16690791,#2890,Korhonen 2006,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
"Function, morphology and protein expression of ageing skeletal muscle: a cross-sectional study of elderly men with different training backgrounds.",Klitgaard H; Mantoni M; Schiaffino S; Ausoni S; Gorza L; Laurent-Winter C; Schnohr P; Saltin B,"The function and morphology of knee extension/m. vastus lateralis and elbow flexion/m. biceps brachii were studied in young (28 +/- 0.1 years, n = 7) and elderly (68 +/- 0.5 years, n = 8) sedentary subjects and in elderly swimmers (69 +/- 1.9 years, n = 6), runners (70 +/- 0.7 years, n = 5) and strength-trained subjects (68 +/- 0.8 years, n = 7). On average, the training groups had, for the 12-17 years before the measurements were taken, performed their training regimen 3 +/- 0.1 times a week. Compared with the young subjects, the maximal isometric torque of the sedentary elderly subjects was 44% (P less than 0.05) lower in knee extension and 32% (P less than 0.05) lower in elbow flexion, and speed of movement was between 20 and 26% (P less than 0.05) lower in both knee extension and elbow flexion. The cross-sectional area of m. quadriceps femoris and the elbow flexors was also 24% (P less than 0.05) and 20% lower respectively, and the specific tension was 27% (P less than 0.05) lower in m. quadriceps femoris and 14% (P less than 0.05) lower in the elbow flexors. A 27% (P less than 0.05) higher content of myosin heavy chain type I and a 39% (P less than 0.05) higher content of the slow-type myosin light chain--2 was observed in m. vastus lateralis of the sedentary elderly subjects as compared with the young subjects. The same tendency was also seen with m. biceps brachii. Since the histochemical fibre-type distribution was identical and no major co-expression of type I and type II myosin heavy-chain isoforms was observed with immunocytochemistry, the increase in slow myosin isoforms with ageing seems mainly related to a larger relative area of type I fibres, induced by a selective atrophy of type II fibre area. An increased content of the beta-isoform of tropomyosin was also demonstrated with ageing. In contrast to the swimmers and runners, the elderly strength-trained subjects had maximal isometric torques, speed of movements, cross-sectional areas, specific tensions and a content of myosin and tropomyosin isoforms in both muscles studied identical to those of the young controls. These results seem to suggest that strength training can counteract the age-related changes in function and morphology of the ageing human skeletal muscle.",1990,Sep,Acta Physiol Scand,140,1,41-54,,10.1111/j.1748-1716.1990.tb08974.x,2275404,#2899,Klitgaard 1990,Exclusion reason: PCSA not directly measured; ,Whole muscle,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Human vastus lateralis and soleus muscles display divergent cellular contractile properties.,Luden N; Minchev K; Hayes E; Louis E; Trappe T; Trappe S,"The purpose of this study was to investigate potential differences in single-fiber contractile physiology of fibers with the same myosin heavy chain isoform (MHC I and MHC IIa) originating from different muscles. Vastus lateralis (VL) and soleus biopsies were obtained from 27 recreationally active females (31 +/- 1 yr, 59 +/- 1 kg). A total of 943 single fibers (MHC I = 562; MHC IIa = 301) were isolated and examined for diameter, peak tension (Po), shortening velocity (Vo), and power. The soleus had larger (P < 0.05) fibers (MHC I +18%; MHC IIa +19%), higher MHC I Vo (+13%), and higher MHC I Po (+18%) compared with fibers from the VL. In contrast, fibers from the VL had higher (P < 0.05) specific tension (MHC I +18%; MHC IIa +20%), and MHC I normalized power (+25%) compared with the soleus. There was a trend for MHC IIa soleus fibers to have higher Vo [MHC IIa +13% (P = 0.058)], whereas VL MHC IIa fibers showed a trend for higher normalized power compared with soleus fibers [MHC IIa +33% (P = 0.079)]. No differences in absolute power were detected between muscles.

"The effects of accentuated eccentric loading on strength, muscle hypertrophy, and neural adaptations in trained individuals.",Brandenburg JP; Docherty D,"The purpose of this study was to compare the strength and neuromuscular adaptations for dynamic constant external resistance (DCER) training and dynamic accentuated external resistance (DAER) training (resistance training employing an accentuated load during eccentric actions). Male subjects active in resistance training were assigned to either a DCER training group (n = 10) or a DAER training group (n = 8) for 9 weeks. Subjects in the DCER group performed 4 sets of 10 repetitions with a load of 75% concentric 1 repetition maximum (RM). Subjects in the DAER group performed 3 sets of 10 repetitions with a concentric load of 75% of 1RM and an eccentric load of approximately 120% of concentric 1RM. Three measures reflecting adaptation of elbow flexors and extensors were recorded pretraining and posttraining: concentric 1RM, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), and specific tension. Strength was assessed at midtraining periods. No significant changes in muscle CSA were observed in either group. Both training groups experienced significant increases in concentric 1RM and specific tension of both the elbow flexors and extensors, but compared with DCER training, DAER training produced significantly greater increases in concentric 1RM of the elbow extensors. These results suggest that, for some exercises, DAER training may be more effective than DCER training in developing strength within a 9-week training phase. However, for trained subjects, neither protocol is effective in eliciting muscle hypertrophy.",2002,Feb,J Strength Cond Res,16,1,25-32,,,11834103,#2948,Brandenburg 2002,Exclusion reason: muscles grouped as one; ,,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Maximum velocity of shortening in relation to myosin isoform composition in single fibres from human skeletal muscles.,Larsson L; Moss RL,"1. Maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) and compositions of myosin heavy chain (MHC) and myosin light chain (MLC) isoforms were determined in single fibres from the soleus or the lateral region of the quadriceps (vastus lateralis) muscles in man. Muscle samples were obtained by percutaneous biopsy, and membranes were permeabilized by glycerol treatment (chemical skinning) or by freeze-drying. 2. Types I, IIA and IIB MHCs were resolved from single fibre segments by 6% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and five different fibre types were identified: fibres containing type I MHC, types I and IIA MHCs, type IIA MHC, types IIA and IIB MHCs, and type IIB MHC. Only a few fibres co-expressed types I and IIA MHCs but 28% of all quadriceps fibres expressed both IIA and IIB MHCs in variable proportions. Fibres co-expressing types I and IIB MHCs were not found. 3. Alkali (MLC1 and MLC3) and dithio nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) (MLC2) myosin light chains were observed in all type II fibres in variable proportions. MLC (MLC1s and MLC2s) isoforms from type I fibres had lower migration rates than the corresponding isoforms from type II fibres (MLC1f and MLC2f). More than half of type I fibres in both soleus (65%) and quadriceps (68%) muscles also expressed 'fast' MLC3 and 36% of the type II fibres from quadriceps muscle expressed the slow isoform of MLC2. 4. Differences were observed in some mechanical characteristics of freeze-dried versus chemically skinned fibres. Maximum tension (P0) and specific tension were lower in freeze-dried types I and IIA fibres than in chemically skinned, while no differences were observed in the IIA/B fibres. The numbers of types I/IIA and IIB fibres were too low to allow statistical comparisons. In chemically skinned fibres, mean specific tension (0.20 +/- 0.01 N/mm2) did not vary with fibre type. In freeze-dried fibres, on the other hand, specific tensions varied according to MHC type: higher (P < 0.01) specific tensions were observed in types IIB (0.19 +/- 0.01 N/mm2) and type IIA/B fibres (0.18 +/- 0.04 N/mm2) than in type I fibres (0.12 +/- 0.02 N/mm2). The specific tension of type IIA fibres (0.12 +/- 0.05 N/mm2) did not differ significantly from the other fibre types. Cross-sectional areas and mean Vmax did not differ between freeze-dried and chemically skinned fibres, either when all fibres were pooled or within respective fibre types. Vmax data from all fibres of a given type, irrespective of membrane permeabilization technique, have therefore been pooled.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1993,Dec,J Physiol,472,,595-614,,10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019964,8145163,#2955,Larsson 1993,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,,ST value not reported (F/CSA for QF),,,,,,,,
"Relative changes in maximal force, EMG, and muscle cross-sectional area after isometric training.",Garfinkel S; Cafarelli E,"The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether training-induced increases in maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) can be completely accounted for by increases in muscle cross-sectional area. Fifteen female university students were randomly divided into a control (N = 7) and an experimental (N = 8) group. The experimental group underwent 8 wk of isometric resistance training of the knee extensors of one leg; the other leg was the untrained control. Training consisted of 30 MVC.d-1 x 3 d.wk-1 x 8 wk. Extensor cross-sectional area (CSA), assessed by computerized tomographic (CT) scanning of a cross-sectional slice at mid-thigh, was used as a measure of muscle hypertrophy. After 8 wk of training, MVC increased by 28% (P < 0.05), CSA increased by 14.6% (P < 0.05), and the amplitude of the electromyogram at MVC (EMGmax) was unchanged in the trained leg of the experimental subjects. The same measures in the untrained legs of the experimental subjects and in both legs of the control subjects were not changed after training. Although there was an apparent discrepancy between the increase in MCV (28%) and CSA (14.6%), the ratio between the two, the specific tension (N.cm-2), was not significantly different after training. As a result of these findings, we conclude that in these subjects there is no evidence of nonhypertrophic adaptations to resistance training of this type and magnitude, and that the increase in force-generating capacity of the muscle is due to the synthesis of additional contractile proteins.",1992,Nov,Med Sci Sports Exerc,24,11,1220-7,,,1435173,#2964,Garfinkel 1992,Exclusion reason: Specific tension value not reported; ,Whole muscle; external force measured,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
In vivo and in vitro evidence that intrinsic upper- and lower-limb skeletal muscle function is unaffected by ageing and disuse in oldest-old humans.,Venturelli M; Saggin P; Muti E; Naro F; Cancellara L; Toniolo L; Tarperi C; Calabria E; Richardson RS; Reggiani C; Schena F,"AIM: To parse out the impact of advanced ageing and disuse on skeletal muscle function, we utilized both in vivo and in vitro techniques to comprehensively assess upper- and lower-limb muscle contractile properties in 8 young (YG; 25 ± 6 years) and 8 oldest-old mobile (OM; 87 ± 5 years) and 8 immobile (OI; 88 ± 4 years) women. METHODS: In vivo, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), electrically evoked resting twitch force (RT), and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the quadriceps and elbow flexors were assessed. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis and biceps brachii facilitated the in vitro assessment of single fibre-specific tension (Po). RESULTS: In vivo, compared to the young, both the OM and OI exhibited a more pronounced loss of MVC in the lower limb [OM (-60%) and OI (-75%)] than the upper limb (OM = -51%; OI = -47%). Taking into account the reduction in muscle PCSA (OM = -10%; OI = -18%), only evident in the lower limb, by calculating voluntary muscle-specific force, the lower limb of the OI (-40%) was more compromised than the OM (-13%). However, in vivo, RT in both upper and lower limbs (approx. 9.8 N m cm(-2) ) and Po (approx. 123 mN mm(-2) ), assessed in vitro, implies preserved intrinsic contractile function in all muscles of the oldest-old and were well correlated (r = 0.81). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that in the oldest-old, neither advanced ageing nor disuse, per se, impacts intrinsic skeletal muscle function, as assessed in vitro. However, in vivo, muscle function is attenuated by age and exacerbated by disuse, implicating factors other than skeletal muscle, such as neuromuscular control, in this diminution of function.",2015,Sep,Acta Physiol (Oxf),215,1,58-71,,10.1111/apha.12524,25965867,#2974,Venturelli 2015,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,Muscle Fiber,,,,,,,,
Lower limb skeletal muscle function after 6 wk of bed rest.,Berg HE; Larsson L; Tesch PA,"Force, electromyographic (EMG) activity, muscle mass, and fiber characteristics were studied in seven healthy men before and after 6 wk of bed rest. Maximum voluntary isometric and concentric knee extensor torque decreased (P < 0.05) uniformly across angular velocities by 25-30% after bed rest. Maximum quadricep rectified EMG decreased by 19 +/- 23%, whereas submaximum (100-Nm isometric action) EMG increased by 44 +/- 28%. Knee extensor muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), assessed by using magnetic resonance imaging, decreased by 14 +/- 4%. Maximum torque per knee extensor CSA decreased by 13 +/- 9%. Vastus lateralis fiber CSA decreased 18 +/- 14%. Neither type I, IIA, and IIB fiber percentages nor their relative proportions of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms were altered after bed rest. Because the decline in strength could not be entirely accounted for by using decreased muscle CSA, it is suggested that the strength loss is also due to factors resulting in decreased neural input to muscle and/or reduced specific tension of muscle, as evidenced by decreased torque/EMG ratio. Additionally, it is concluded that muscle unloading in humans does not induce important changes in fiber type or MHC composition or in vivo muscle contractile properties.",1997,Jan,J Appl Physiol (1985),82,1,182-8,,10.1152/jappl.1997.82.1.182,9029214,#2978,Berg 1997,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,,ST value not reported (1RM/ QF muscle thickness),,,,,,,,
Repetitions to failure versus not to failure during concurrent training in healthy elderly men: A randomized clinical trial.,da Silva LXN; Teodoro JL; Menger E; Lopez P; Grazioli R; Farinha J; Moraes K; Bottaro M; Pinto RS; Izquierdo M; Cadore EL,"This randomized clinical trial compared the neuromuscular adaptations induced by concurrent training (CT) performed with repetitions to concentric failure and not to failure in elderly men. Fifty-two individuals (66.2 ± 5.2 years) completed the pre- and post-measurements and were divided into three groups: repetitions to failure (RFG, n = 17); repetitions not to failure (NFG, n = 20); and repetitions not to failure with total volume equalized to RFG (ENFG, n = 15). Participants were assessed in isometric knee extension peak torque (PT(iso)), maximal strength (1RM) in the leg press (LP) and knee extension (KE) exercises, quadriceps femoris muscle thickness (QF MT), specific tension, rate of torque development (RTD) at 50, 100 and 250 ms, countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) performance, as well as maximal neuromuscular activity (EMG(max)) of the vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscles. CT was performed over 12 weeks, twice weekly. Along with each specific strength training program, each group also underwent an endurance training in the same session. After training, all groups improved similarly and significantly in LP and KE 1RM, PT(iso), CMJ and SJ performance, RTD variables, specific tension, and VL EMG(max), (P < 0.05-0.001). QF MT improved only in RFG and ENFG (P < 0.01). These results suggest that repetitions until concentric failure does not provide further neuromuscular performance gains and muscle hypertrophy, and that even a low number of repetitions relative to the maximal possible (i.e., 50%) optimizes neuromuscular performance in elderly men.

Contractile muscle volume and agonist-antagonist coactivation account for differences in torque between young and older women.,Macaluso A; Nimmo MA; Foster JE; Cockburn M; McMillan NC; De Vito G,"It is controversial whether specific tension (the ratio between muscle strength and size) declines with aging. Therefore, contractile muscle volume was estimated separately from the intramuscular noncontractile tissue by magnetic resonance imaging, and maximum isometric torque was measured in the knee extensors and flexors of 10 young (22.8 +/- 5.7 years) and 10 older (69.5 +/- 2.4 years) healthy active women. Specific tension was lower in the older women both in the extensors (93.1 +/- 20.1 kN x m(-2) vs. 112.1 +/- 12.3 kN x m(-2); P < 0.05) and in the flexors (100 +/- 31 kN x m(-2) vs. 142.7 +/- 23.9 kN x m(-2); P < 0.01). This was accompanied by an increase in the percentage coactivation of the knee flexors during knee extension. These data suggest that the lower level of muscle torque in the older women can be explained not only by smaller contractile muscle mass but also by increased coactivation of the antagonist muscles during knee extension.",2002,Jun,Muscle Nerve,25,6,858-63,,10.1002/mus.10113,12115975,#3024,Macaluso 2002,Exclusion reason: Torque/PCSA reported instead of specific tension (F/PCSA) value reported; ,,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,

Single muscle fiber contractile properties during a competitive season in male runners.,Harber MP; Gallagher PM; Creer AR; Minchev KM; Trappe SW,"The purpose of this investigation was to examine the contractile properties of individual myofibers in response to periodized training periods throughout a collegiate cross-country season in male runners. Muscle biopsies of the gastrocnemius were taken after a summer base training phase (T1), an 8-wk intense training period (T2), and a 4-wk taper phase (T3). Five runners (n = 5; age = 20 +/- 1 yr; wt = 65 +/- 4 kg; ht = 178 +/- 3 cm) completed all three time points. A total of 328 individual muscle fibers [myosin heavy chain (MHC) I = 66%; MHC IIa = 33%; hybrids = 1%] were isolated and studied at 15 degrees C for their contractile properties. Diameter of MHC I fibers was 3% smaller (P < 0.05) at T2 compared with T1 and an additional 4% smaller (P < 0.05) after the taper. Cell size was unaltered in the MHC IIa fibers. MHC I and IIa fiber strength increased 18 and 11% (P < 0.05), respectively, from T1 to T2. MHC I fibers produced 9% less force (P < 0.05) after the taper, whereas MHC IIa fibers were 9% stronger (P < 0.05). Specific tension increased 38 and 26% (P < 0.05) for MHC I and IIa fibers, respectively, from T1 to T2 and was unchanged with the taper. Maximal shortening velocity (Vo) of the MHC I fibers decreased 23% (P < 0.05) from T1 to T2 and 17% (P < 0.05) from T2 to T3, whereas MHC IIa Vo was unchanged. MHC I peak power decreased 20% (P < 0.05) from T1 to T2 and 25% (P < 0.05) from T2 to T3, whereas MHC IIa peak power was unchanged. Power corrected for cell size decreased 15% (P < 0.05) from T2 to T3 and was 24% (P < 0.05) lower at T3 compared with T1 for the MHC I fibers only.

Effects of muscle composition and architecture on specific strength in obese older women.,Rastelli F; Capodaglio P; Orgiu S; Santovito C; Caramenti M; Cadioli M; Falini A; Rizzo G; Lafortuna CL,"What is the central question of this study? Do obesity-specific factors affect skeletal muscle performance in older individuals? What is the main finding and its importance? Older obese women have a larger quadriceps femoris size but develop lower tension per unit of skeletal muscle than their normal-weight counterparts. Muscle impairment and excess body mass are very common among older people. Given that the effect of obesity on strength production has scarcely been studied in older individuals, we analysed functional and structural characteristics of quadriceps femoris (QF) in obese (OB) and normal-weight (NW) older women with comparable habitual physical activity. In five OB (body mass index 36.8 ± 1.9 kg m(-2), age 72.4 ± 2.3 years) and six NW well-functioning older women (body mass index 24.3 ± 1.8 kg m(-2), age 72.7 ± 1.9 years), peak knee-extension torque (KET) was measured in isometric (90 deg knee flexion) and isokinetic conditions (240, 180, 120 and 60 deg s(-1)). Mid-thigh QF cross-sectional area (CSA) and muscle tissue fat content (MF%) were determined with magnetic resonance imaging (Dixon sequence). Muscle fascicle length and pennation angle (PA) were assessed with ultrasonography for each muscle belly of the QF (vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, rectus femoris and vastus intermedius). Despite similar values of KET, CSA was 17.0% larger in OB than in NW women (P < 0.05), so that KET/CSA was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in OB women. Compared with NW women, OB women had 28.7% higher MF% (P < 0.05) and 24.9% higher average PA (P < 0.05), while fascicle length was similar. Overall, isometric KET/CSA was negatively affected by both MF% (P < 0.05) and PA (P < 0.05), while isokinetic KET/CSA was negatively affected only by MF% (P < 0.01). Muscle composition and architecture seem to be important determinants of KET/CSA in elderly women. In fact, owing to the effect of obesity overload, OB women have a larger QF size than NW women, but unfavourable muscle composition and architecture. The higher MF% and steeper PA observed in OB women are associated with reduced levels of muscle specific strength.",2015,Oct,Exp Physiol,100,10,1159-67,,10.1113/EP085273,26279270,#3179,Rastelli 2015,Exclusion reason: Torque/PCSA reported instead of specific tension (F/PCSA) value reported; ,,ST of muscle fibers,,,,,,,,
Muscle function in 164 men and women aged 20--84 yr.,Akima H; Kano Y; Enomoto Y; Ishizu M; Okada M; Oishi Y; Katsuta S; Kuno S,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of aging in men and women on muscle functional properties, i.e., muscle force and force per unit of cross-sectional area (force/CSA). METHODS: A total of 164 volunteers participated in this study and were divided into five groups according to their chronological age as follows: 20s (20--39 yr old), 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s (70--84 yr old). Isokinetic (0, 60, 180, and 300 degrees.s(-1)) knee extensor and flexor peak torque, and CSA of the quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle of the mid-thigh were measured. RESULTS: Peak torque during knee extension and flexion was inversely related to age in both men and women. This was the case irrespective of the speed of contraction in both genders (men: r = -0.797 to -0.756, all P < 0.001, women: r = -0.639 to -0.530, all P < 0.001). A significant correlation was observed between CSA of QF and peak torque during isometric knee extension in men (r = 0.827, P < 0.001) and women (r = 0.657, P < 0.001). During isometric contraction, the force/CSA exhibited a significant decrease with increasing age in men (r = -0.518, P < 0.001) but not in women (r = -0.207, NS).

For the SED group, peak isometric tension (Pzero) averaged 143 +/- 3, 156 +/- 4, and 170 +/- 4 kN/m2 and maximal shortening velocity (Vzero) averaged 0.43 +/- 0.01, 1.90 +/- 0.08, and 5.59 +/- 0.40 fiber lengths/s for fibers expressing type I, IIa, and IIx MHC, respectively (all comparisons, P < 0.05). Hill plot analysis of relative forces during submaximal Ca2+ activation indicated no SED vs. RUN differences in Ca2+ sensitivity or in the cooperativity of Ca2+ activation. However, at maximal Ca2+ activation, RUN type I and IIa fibers produced 15% less peak absolute force than SED fibers (P < 0.05). This reduction in fiber force was a direct result of the smaller diameter of the RUN fibers (P < 0.05), because Pzero, peak elastic modulus (Ezero), and Pzero/Ezero were not different between SED and RUN groups. RUN type I fibers also displayed a mean Vzero that was 19% higher than the average Vzero of the SED type I fibers (P < 0.05). In separate experiments, quantification of relative myosin light chain (MLC) isoform content revealed a 28% greater ratio of MLC3 to MLC2 in single type I fibers from the RUN group (P < 0.05), suggesting that the elevated Vzero of the RUN type I fibers was related to a greater expression of MLC3. In conclusion, the single fibers from the elite master runners displayed specific morphological and contractile properties that may enhance the performance of these athletes during prolonged muscular activity.",1996,Aug,Am J Physiol,271,2 Pt 1,C666-75,,10.1152/ajpcell.1996.271.2.C666,8770008,#3292,Widrick 1996,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,Modeling and optimization-based calculation of ST,,,,,,,,
Force-velocity properties of human skeletal muscle fibres: myosin heavy chain isoform and temperature dependence.,Bottinelli R; Canepari M; Pellegrino MA; Reggiani C,"1. A large population (n = 151) of human skinned skeletal muscle fibres has been studied. Force-velocity curves of sixty-seven fibres were obtained by load-clamp manoeuvres at 12 degrees C. In each fibre maximum shortening velocity (Vmax), maximum power output (Wmax), optimal velocity (velocity at which Wmax is developed, Vopt), optimal force (force at which Wmax is developed, Popt), specific tension (Po/CSA, isometric tension/cross-sectional area) were assessed. Unloaded shortening velocity (Vo) was also determined at 12 degrees C in a different group (n = 57) of fibres by slack-test procedure. 2. All fibres used for mechanical experiments were characterized on the basis of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform composition by sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and divided into five types: type I (or slow), types IIA and IIB (or fast), and types I-IIA and IIA-IIB (or mixed types). 3. Vmax, Wmax, Vopt, Popt, Vopt/Vmax ratio, Po/CSA and Vo were found to depend on MHC isoform composition. All parameters were significantly lower in type I than in the fast (type IIA and IIB) fibres. Among fast fibres, Vmax, Wmax, Vopt and Vo were significantly lower in type IIA and than in IIB fibres, whereas Popt, Po/CSA and Vopt/Vmax were similar. 4. The temperature dependence of Vo and Po/CSA was assessed in a group of twenty-one fibres in the range 12-22 degrees C. In a set of six fibres temperature dependence of Vmax was also studied. The Q10 (5.88) and activation energy E (125 kJ mol-1) values for maximum shortening velocity calculated from Arrhenius plots pointed to a very high temperature sensitivity. Po/CSA was very temperature dependent in the 12-17 degrees C range, but less dependent between 17 and 22 degrees C.",1996,Sep,J Physiol,495 ( Pt 2),Pt 2,573-86,,10.1113/jphysiol.1996.sp021617,8887767,#3348,Bottinelli 1996,Exclusion reason: specific tension from single fibers; ,Fiber,Passive muscle tension calculated,,,,,,,,

Muscle volume is a major determinant of joint torque in humans,"Fukunaga, T; Miyatani, M; Tachi, M; Kouzaki, M; Kawakami, Y; Kanehisa, H",,2001,,Acta physiologica scandinavica,172,4,249-255,,,,#4109,Fukunaga 2001,"Exclusion reason: Torque/PCSA reported instead of specific tension (F/PCSA) value reported; Paula Pino (2022-11-30 02:56:50)(Screen): Abstract
Muscle force (MF) is linearly related to physiological cross-sectional area (CSA), which is obtained from muscle volume (MV) divided by fibre length. Taking into account the fact that joint torque (TQ) is determined by MF multiplied by the moment arm, the maximal TQ would be a function of MV. This proposition was tested in the present study by investigating the relationship between MV and TQ for elbow flexor (EF) and extensor (EE) muscles of 26 males. The MVs of EF and EE were determined from a series of muscle CSA by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and pennation angle (θ) and FL by ultrasonography (US). Maximal isometric TQ was measured at right angle of elbow joint for EF and EE. There was a highly significant correlation between MV and TQ both for EF and EE (r=0.95 and 0.96 respectively) compared with that between muscle CSA and TQ, suggesting the dependence of TQ on MV. Furthermore, prediction equations for MV (MVULT) from muscle thickness (MT) measured by US was developed with reference to MVMRI by the MRI on 26 subjects, and the equations were applied to estimate MV of healthy university students (CON; 160 males) and sports athletes (ATH; 99 males). There were significant linear relationships between MVULT and TQ both for EF (r=0.783) and EE (r=0.695) for all subjects (n=259). The MVULT was significantly higher in ATH (by 32% for EF and 33% for EE, respectively) than in CON. Similarly, significantly greater TQ was observed in ATH (by 35% for EF, 37% for EE, respectively). The θ for EE showed no difference between both groups (17.8° for CON and 17.5° for ATH). On the other hand, the TQ to MV ratio were identical for CON and ATH. The results reveal that the muscle volume of the upper arm is a major determinant of joint torque (TQ), regardless of athletic training.; ",,Torque/PCSA reported,,,,,,,,

Measurement of fibre pennation using ultrasound in the human quadriceps in vivo,"Rutherford, OM; Jones, DA","Real-time ultrasound scanning was used to measure the angles of fibre pennation of vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus intermedius (VI) of the human quadriceps (n = 12) in vivo. The maximum isometric force and cross-sectional area of the quadriceps were also measured. With the knee at right-angles the mean fibre angles for VL and VI respectively were 0.133 (0.021) rad [7.6 degrees (1.2 degrees)] and 0.143 (0.028) rad [8.2 degrees (1.6 degrees)] [mean (SD)], which is within the range of angles measured on cadavers. The mean angle decreased in going from the contracted [VL, 0.244 rad (14 degrees); VI, 0.279 rad (16 degrees)] to the stretched [VL, 0.105 rad (6 degrees); VI, 0.122 rad (7 degrees)] position. There was a significant positive correlation between fibre angle and muscle cross-sectional area but no relationship between fibre angle and force per cross-sectional area. No increase in fibre angle was detected after 3 months strength training. We conclude that ultrasound can be used to measure pennation angles of superficial muscle groups but we could not demonstrate a relationship between pennation and force-generating capacity.",1992,,European journal of applied physiology and occupational physiology,65,5,433-437,,,1425649,#4184,Rutherford 1992,Exclusion reason: PCSA not directly measured; ,Whole muscle,Quadriceps anatomical CSA used ,"RutherfordO MOMDepartment of Medicine, Rayne Institute, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London, UK.","Real-time ultrasound scanning was used to measure the angles of fibre pennation of vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus intermedius (VI) of the human quadriceps (n = 12) in vivo.

Specific strength and voluntary muscle activation in young and elderly women and men,"Kent-Braun, Jane A.; Ng, Alexander V.","The extents to which decreased muscle size or activation are responsible for the decrease in strength commonly observed with aging remain unclear. Our purpose was to compare muscle isometric strength [maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)], cross-sectional area (CSA), specific strength (MVC/CSA), and voluntary activation in the ankle dorsiflexor muscles of 24 young (32 +/- 1 yr) and 24 elderly (72 +/- 1 yr) healthy men and women of similar physical activity level. Three measures of voluntary muscle activation were used: the central activation ratio [MVC/(MVC + superimposed force)], the maximal rate of voluntary isometric force development, and foot tap speed. Men had higher MVC and CSA than did women. Young men had higher MVC compared with elderly men [262 +/- 19 (SE) vs. 197 +/- 22 N, respectively], whereas MVC was similar in young and elderly women (136 +/- 15 vs. 149 +/- 16 N, respectively). CSA was greater in young compared with elderly subjects. There was no age-related impairment of specific strength, central activation ratio, or the rate of voluntary force development. Foot tap speed was reduced in elderly (34 +/- 1 taps/10 s) compared with young subjects (47 +/- 1 taps/10 s). These results suggest that isometric specific strength and the ability to fully and rapidly activate the dorsiflexor muscles during a single isometric contraction were unimpaired by aging. However, there was an age-related deficit in the ability to perform rapid repetitive dynamic contractions.",1999,,Journal of Applied Physiology,87,1,22-29,,10.1152/jappl.1999.87.1.22,,#4203,Kent-Braun 1999,Exclusion reason: Torque/PCSA reported instead of specific tension (F/PCSA) value reported; ,,Torque/PCSA reported,Torque/PCSA reported,,,,,,,
