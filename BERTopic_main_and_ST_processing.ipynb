            "length of 1439 and eg abs:OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the reliability and the discriminative validity of surface electromyography (sEMG) in the assessment of patients with primary muscle tension dysphonia (MTD). STUDY DESIGN: The study design is cross-sectional. METHODS: Fifteen patients with primary MTD (mean age: 34.07 ± 10.99 years) and 15 healthy volunteers (mean age: 34.53 ± 10.63 years) were included. All participants underwent evaluation of sEMG to record the electrical activity of the thyrohyoid and cricothyroid muscles. The outcome measures were the root mean square (RMS), activity peak, duration, and time to the peak activity, which were obtained during /a/ and /i/ prolongation for test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The test-retest reliability was good to excellent for the RMS and peak activity measures (intraclass correlation coefficient [agreement] [ICC(agreement)] = 0.49-0.98). The reliability for the activity duration was poor to excellent (ICC(agreement) = 0.19-0.9). Poor test-retest reliability was found for the time to peak measure (ICC(agreement) = 0.15-0.37). The standard error of measurement for all sEMG measures was between 0.41 and 2.05. The smallest detectable change (SDC) was calculated between 1.13 and 5.66. The highest SDC values were obtained for the peak and the lowest SDCs were documented for the duration (5.66 and 1.13, respectively). All sEMG measures were not able to discriminate between the MTD patients and healthy subjects (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The sEMG is a reliable tool to measure the RMS, the peak activity, and the activity duration in primary MTD. However, it is not able to discriminate the patients with primary MTD from healthy subjects.\n"

Regarding training variables, the most effective values are widely described in the literature. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the efficiency of advanced RT techniques and methods in comparison to traditional approaches. METHODS: MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from 1996 to September 2019 for all studies investigating the effects of advanced RT techniques and methods on muscle hypertrophy and training variables. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria and were consequently included for the quality assessment and data extraction. RESULTS: Concerning the time-efficiency of training, the use of agonist-antagonist, upper-lower body supersets, drop and cluster sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, employment of fast, but controlled duration of eccentric contractions (~2s), and high-load RT supplemented with low-load RT under blood flow restriction may provide an additional stimulus and an advantage to traditional training protocols. With regard to the higher degree of mechanical tension, the use of accentuated eccentric loading in RT should be considered. Implementation of drop sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, low-load RT in conjunction with low-load RT under blood flow restriction could provide time-efficient solutions to increased metabolic stress. CONCLUSIONS: Due to insufficient evidence, it is difficult to provide specific guidelines for volume, intensity of effort, and frequency of previously mentioned RT techniques and methods. However, well-trained athletes may integrate advanced RT techniques and methods into their routines as an additional stimulus to break through plateaus and to prevent training monotony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |      2019      |       Dec       |    Int J Environ Res Public Health     |   16   |    24    |    nan    |       nan        |      10.3390/ijerph16244897      | 31817252.0 |    #2636    |    Krzysztofik 2019    |  nan  | nan  |                        Maximizing Muscle Hypertrophy: A Systematic Review of Advanced Resistance Training Techniques and Methods.                        |                                               KrzysztofikMichalM0000-0003-2797-8431Institute of Sport Sciences, Jerzy Kukuczka Academy of Physical Education in Katowice, ul.

regarding training variables, the most effective values are widely described in the literature. however, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the efficiency of advanced rt techniques and methods in comparison to traditional approaches. methods: medline and sportdiscus databases were searched from 1996 to september 2019 for all studies investigating the effects of advanced rt techniques and methods on muscle hypertrophy and training variables. thirty articles met the inclusion criteria and were consequently included for the quality assessment and data extraction. results: concerning the time-efficiency of training, the use of agonist-antagonist, upper-lower body supersets, drop and cluster sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, employment of fast, but controlled duration of eccentric contractions (~2s), and high-load rt supplemented with low-load rt under blood flow restriction may provide an additional stimulus and an advantage to traditional training protocols. with regard to the higher degree of mechanical tension, the use of accentuated eccentric loading in rt should be considered. implementation of drop sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, low-load rt in conjunction with low-load rt under blood flow restriction could provide time-efficient solutions to increased metabolic stress. conclusions: due to insufficient evidence, it is difficult to provide specific guidelines for volume, intensity of effort, and frequency of previously mentioned rt techniques and methods. however, well-trained athletes may integrate advanced rt techniques and methods into their routines as an additional stimulus to break through plateaus and to prevent training monotony.

Recent knowledge introduced MTD as a bridge between functional and organic disorders. This review addresses the causal and contributing factors of MTD and evaluates the different treatment options. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (Pubmed, 1950-2009) and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2009). Studies were included if they reviewed the classification of functional dysphonia or the pathophysiology of MTD. Etiology and pathophysiology of MTD and circumlaryngeal manual therapy (CMT) were obligatory based on reviews and prospective cohort studies because randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are nonexisting. Concerning the treatment options of voice therapy and vocal hygiene, selection was based on RCTs and systematic reviews. RESULTS: Etiological factors can be categorized into three new subgroups: (1) psychological and/or personality factors, (2) vocal misuse and abuse, and (3) compensation for underlying disease. The effective treatment options for MTD are (1) indirect therapy: vocal hygiene and patient education; (2) direct therapy: voice therapy and CMT; (3) medical treatment; and (4) surgery for secondary organic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: MTD is the pathological condition in which an excessive tension of the (para)laryngeal musculature, caused by a diverse number of etiological factors, leads to a disturbed voice. Etiological factors range from psychological/personality disorders and vocal misuse/abuse to compensatory vocal habits in case of laryngopharyngeal reflux, upper airway infections, and organic lesions.

(2) direct therapy: voice therapy and cmt; (3) medical treatment; and (4) surgery for secondary organic lesions. conclusions: mtd is the pathological condition in which an excessive tension of the (para)laryngeal musculature, caused by a diverse number of etiological factors, leads to a disturbed voice. etiological factors range from psychological/personality disorders and vocal misuse/abuse to compensatory vocal habits in case of laryngopharyngeal reflux, upper airway infections, and organic lesions. mtd needs to be approached in a multidisciplinary setting where close cooperation between a laryngologist and a speech language pathologist is possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |        1        |\n",

However, more recently, the use of low-intensity resistance exercise with blood-flow restriction (BFR) has challenged this theory and consistently shown that hypertrophic adaptations can be induced with much lower exercise intensities (<50% 1-RM). Despite the potent hypertrophic effects of BFR resistance training being demonstrated by numerous studies, the underlying mechanisms responsible for such effects are not well defined. Metabolic stress has been suggested to be a primary factor responsible, and this is theorised to activate numerous other mechanisms, all of which are thought to induce muscle growth via autocrine and/or paracrine actions. However, it is noteworthy that some of these mechanisms do not appear to be mediated to any great extent by metabolic stress but rather by mechanical tension (another primary factor of muscle hypertrophy). Given that the level of mechanical tension is typically low with BFR resistance exercise (<50% 1-RM), one may question the magnitude of involvement of these mechanisms aligned to the adaptations reported with BFR resistance training. However, despite the low level of mechanical tension, it is plausible that the effects induced by the primary factors (mechanical tension and metabolic stress) are, in fact, additive, which ultimately contributes to the adaptations seen with BFR resistance training. Exercise-induced mechanical tension and metabolic stress are theorised to signal a number of mechanisms for the induction of muscle growth, including increased fast-twitch fibre recruitment, mechanotransduction, muscle damage, systemic and localised hormone production, cell swelling, and the production of reactive oxygen species and its variants, including nitric oxide and heat shock proteins. However, the relative extent to which these specific mechanisms are induced by the primary factors with BFR resistance exercise, as well as their magnitude of involvement in BFR resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy, requires further exploration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |      2015      |       Feb       |               Sports Med               |   45   |    2     |  187-200  |       nan        |    10.1007/s40279-014-0264-9     | 25249278.0 |    #2638    |      Pearson 2015      |  nan  | nan  |                           A review on the mechanisms of blood-flow restriction resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy.                           |                                                     PearsonStephen JohnSJCentre for Health, Sport and Rehabilitation Sciences Research, University of Salford, Manchester, M6 6PU, UK, s.pearson@salford.ac.uk.                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                It has traditionally been believed that resistance training can only induce muscle growth when the exercise intensity is greater than 65% of the 1-repetition maximum (RM). However, more recently, the use of low-intensity resistance exercise with blood-flow restriction (BFR) has challenged this theory and consistently shown that hypertrophic adaptations can be induced with much lower exercise intensities (<50% 1-RM). Despite the potent hypertrophic effects of BFR resistance training being demonstrated by numerous studies, the underlying mechanisms responsible for such effects are not well defined. Metabolic stress has been suggested to be a primary factor responsible, and this is theorised to activate numerous other mechanisms, all of which are thought to induce muscle growth via autocrine and/or paracrine actions. However, it is noteworthy that some of these mechanisms do not appear to be mediated to any great extent by metabolic stress but rather by mechanical tension (another primary factor of muscle hypertrophy). Given that the level of mechanical tension is typically low with BFR resistance exercise (<50% 1-RM), one may question the magnitude of involvement of these mechanisms aligned to the adaptations reported with BFR resistance training. However, despite the low level of mechanical tension, it is plausible that the effects induced by the primary factors (mechanical tension and metabolic stress) are, in fact, additive, which ultimately contributes to the adaptations seen with BFR resistance training.

However, evidence-based, dose-response relationships regarding specific RT variables (e.g., training period, frequency, intensity, volume) are unclear in healthy old adults. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to determine the general effects of RT on measures of muscle strength and morphology and to provide dose-response relationships of RT variables through an analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that could improve muscle strength and morphology in healthy old adults. DATA SOURCES: A computerized, systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library from January 1984 up to June 2015 to identify all RCTs related to RT in healthy old adults. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The initial search identified 506 studies, with a final yield of 25 studies. Only RCTs that examined the effects of RT in adults with a mean age of 65 and older were included. The 25 studies quantified at least one measure of muscle strength or morphology and sufficiently described training variables (e.g., training period, frequency, volume, intensity). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We quantified the overall effects of RT on measures of muscle strength and morphology by computing weighted between-subject standardized mean differences (SMDbs) between intervention and control groups. We analyzed the data for the main outcomes of one-repetition maximum (1RM), maximum voluntary contraction under isometric conditions (MVC), and muscle morphology (i.e., cross-sectional area or volume or thickness of muscles) and assessed the methodological study quality by Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I2 and ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2 statistics. A random effects meta-regression was calculated to explain the influence of key training variables on the effectiveness of RT in terms of muscle strength and morphology. For meta-regression, training variables were divided into the following subcategories: volume, intensity, and rest. In addition to meta-regression, dose-response relationships were calculated independently for single training variables (e.g., training frequency). RESULTS: RT improved muscle strength substantially (mean SMDbs = 1.57; 25 studies), but had small effects on measures of muscle morphology (mean SMDbs = 0.42; nine studies). Specifically, RT produced large effects in both 1RM of upper (mean SMDbs = 1.61; 11 studies) and lower (mean SMDbs = 1.76; 19 studies) extremities and a medium effect in MVC of lower (mean SMDbs = 0.76; four studies) extremities. Results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables \"training period\" (p = 0.04) and \"intensity\" (p < 0.01) as well as \"total time under tension\" (p < 0.01) had significant effects on muscle strength, with the largest effect sizes for the longest training periods (mean SMDbs = 2.34; 50-53 weeks), intensities of 70-79% of the 1RM (mean SMDbs = 1.89), and total time under tension of 6.0 s (mean SMDbs = 3.61). A tendency towards significance was found for rest in between sets (p = 0.06), with 60 s showing the largest effect on muscle strength (mean SMDbs = 4.68; two studies). We also determined the independent effects of the remaining training variables on muscle strength. The following independently computed training variables are most effective in improving measures of muscle strength: a training frequency of two sessions per week (mean SMDbs = 2.13), a training volume of two to three sets per exercise (mean SMDbs = 2.99), seven to nine repetitions per set (mean SMDbs = 1.98), and a rest of 4.0 s between repetitions (SMDbs = 3.72). With regard to measures of muscle morphology, the small number of identified studies allowed us to calculate meta-regression for the subcategory training volume only. No single training volume variable significantly predicted RT effects on measures of muscle morphology. Additional training variables were independently computed to detect the largest effect for the single training variable. A training period of 50-53 weeks, a training frequency of three sessions per week, a training volume of two to three sets per exercise, seven to nine repetitions per set, a training intensity from 51 to 69% of the 1RM, a total time under tension of 6.0 s, a rest of 120 s between sets, and a rest of 2.5 s between repetitions turned out to be most effective. LIMITATIONS: The current results must be interpreted with caution because of the poor overall methodological study quality (mean PEDro score 4.6 points) and the considerable large heterogeneity (I2) = 80%, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ2 = 163.1, df = 32, p < 0.01) for muscle strength. In terms of muscle morphology, our search identified nine studies only, which is why we consider our findings preliminary. While we were able to determine a dose-response relationship based on specific individual training variables with respect to muscle strength and morphology, it was not possible to ascertain any potential interactions between these variables. We recognize the limitation that the results may not represent one general dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of RT on specific measures of upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle morphology in healthy old adults. In addition, we were able to extract dose-response relationships for key training variables (i.e., volume, intensity, rest), informing clinicians and practitioners to design effective RTs for muscle strength and morphology. Training period, intensity, time under tension, and rest in between sets play an important role in improving muscle strength and morphology and should be implemented in exercise training programs targeting healthy old adults. Still, further research is needed to reveal optimal dose-response relationships following RT in healthy as well as mobility limited and/or frail old adults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |      2015      |       Dec       |               Sports Med               |   45   |    12    | 1693-720  |       nan        |    10.1007/s40279-015-0385-9     | 26420238.0 |    #2641    |       Borde 2015       |  nan  | nan  |                     Dose-Response Relationships of Resistance Training in Healthy Old Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.                     |                                   BordeRonRDivision of Training and Movement Sciences, Research Focus Cognition Sciences, University of Potsdam, Am Neuen Palais 10, Building 12, 14469, Potsdam, Germany. rborde@uni-potsdam.de.                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Resistance training (RT) is an intervention frequently used to improve muscle strength and morphology in old age.

relationships regarding specific rt variables (e.g., training period, frequency, intensity, volume) are unclear in healthy old adults. the aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to determine the general effects of rt on measures of muscle strength and morphology and to provide dose-response relationships of rt variables through an analysis of randomized controlled trials (rcts) that could improve muscle strength and morphology in healthy old adults. data sources: a computerized, systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases pubmed, web of science, and the cochrane library from january 1984 up to june 2015 to identify all rcts related to rt in healthy old adults. study eligibility criteria: the initial search identified 506 studies, with a final yield of 25 studies. only rcts that examined the effects of rt in adults with a mean age of 65 and older were included. the 25 studies quantified at least one measure of muscle strength or morphology and sufficiently described training variables (e.g., training period, frequency, volume, intensity). study appraisal and synthesis methods: we quantified the overall effects of rt on measures of muscle strength and morphology by computing weighted between-subject standardized mean differences (smdbs) between intervention and control groups. we analyzed the data for the main outcomes of one-repetition maximum (1rm), maximum voluntary contraction under isometric conditions (mvc), and muscle morphology (i.e., cross-sectional area or volume or thickness of muscles) and assessed the methodological study quality by physiotherapy evidence database (pedro) scale. heterogeneity between studies was assessed using i2 and ãâãâãâãâ2 statistics. a random effects meta-regression was calculated to explain the influence of key training variables on the effectiveness of rt in terms of muscle strength and morphology. for meta-regression, training variables were divided into the following subcategories: volume, intensity, and rest. in addition to meta-regression, dose-response relationships were calculated independently for single training variables (e.g., training frequency). results: rt improved muscle strength substantially (mean smdbs = 1.57; 25 studies), but had small effects on measures of muscle morphology (mean smdbs = 0.42; nine studies). specifically, rt produced large effects in both 1rm of upper (mean smdbs = 1.61; 11 studies) and lower (mean smdbs = 1.76; 19 studies) extremities and a medium effect in mvc of lower (mean smdbs = 0.76; four studies) extremities. results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables \"training period\" (p = 0.04) and \"intensity\" (p < 0.01) as well as \"total time under tension\" (p < 0.01) had significant effects on muscle strength, with the largest effect sizes for the longest training periods (mean smdbs = 2.34; 50-53 weeks), intensities of 70-79% of the 1rm (mean smdbs = 1.89), and total time under tension of 6.0 s (mean smdbs = 3.61). a tendency towards significance was found for rest in between sets (p = 0.06), with 60 s showing the largest effect on muscle strength (mean smdbs = 4.68; two studies). we also determined the independent effects of the remaining training variables on muscle strength. the following independently computed training variables are most effective in improving measures of muscle strength: a training frequency of two sessions per week (mean smdbs = 2.13), a training volume of two to three sets per exercise (mean smdbs = 2.99), seven to nine repetitions per set (mean smdbs = 1.98), and a rest of 4.0 s between repetitions (smdbs = 3.72). with regard to measures of muscle morphology, the small number of identified studies allowed us to calculate meta-regression for the subcategory training volume only. no single training volume variable significantly predicted rt effects on measures of muscle morphology. additional training variables were independently computed to detect the largest effect for the single training variable. a training period of 50-53 weeks, a training frequency of three sessions per week, a training volume of two to three sets per exercise, seven to nine repetitions per set, a training intensity from 51 to 69% of the 1rm, a total time under tension of 6.0 s, a rest of 120 s between sets, and a rest of 2.5 s between repetitions turned out to be most effective. limitations: the current results must be interpreted with caution because of the poor overall methodological study quality (mean pedro score 4.6 points) and the considerable large heterogeneity (i2) = 80%, ãâãâãâãâ2 = 163.1, df = 32, p < 0.01) for muscle strength. in terms of muscle morphology, our search identified nine studies only, which is why we consider our findings preliminary. while we were able to determine a dose-response relationship based on specific individual training variables with respect to muscle strength and morphology, it was not possible to ascertain any potential interactions between these variables. we recognize the limitation that the results may not represent one general dose-response relationship. conclusions: this systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of rt on specific measures of upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle morphology in healthy old adults. in addition, we were able to extract dose-response relationships for key training variables (i.e., volume, intensity, rest), informing clinicians and practitioners to design effective rts for muscle strength and morphology. training period, intensity, time under tension, and rest in between sets play an important role in improving muscle strength and morphology and should be implemented in exercise training programs targeting healthy old adults. still, further research is needed to reveal optimal dose-response relationships following rt in healthy as well as mobility limited and/or frail old adults.

The most widely studied sites of tension transmission are the ends of muscle fibers where they contact either connective or epithelial tissues. In most animals, regardless of phylum, muscle fiber ends are characteristically folded, producing a junctional interface that significantly reduces the absolute value of stress applied to the cell membrane, insures that the principle stress vector at the cell membrane is shear rather than tension, and minimizes stress concentrations. The morphological and molecular similarities of muscle-tendon junctions (MTJs) in different animals suggest that the problem of creating a strong adhesive joint between a muscle fiber and a tissue of dissimilar physical properties is essentially the same for all muscles, and that the solution arose early in evolution. In addition to those muscle fiber ends that occur where fibers contact dissimilar tissues, there are intramuscular fiber terminations that consist either of folded cell-cell junctions similar to the fasciae adherentes of cardiac muscle, or of gradually tapering fiber ends. Both sorts of intramuscular ends occur in those vertebrate muscles in which the individual muscle fibers are too short to reach from the tendon of origin to the tendon of insertion. In series-fibered muscles in which the fiber ends are tapered, tension is transmitted from contractile proteins to endomysial collagen fibrils across the fiber membranes. The endomysium of such muscles is an essential series-elastic element. The existing evidence suggests that tension transmission is a general property of muscle cell surfaces, and that specific junctional morphologies are the results of dynamic interactions between muscle cells and the tissues to which they adhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |      1993      |       nan       |           Acta Anat (Basel)            |  146   |    4     |  205-22   |       nan        |        10.1159/000147459         | 8317197.0  |    #2711    |      Trotter 1993      |  nan  | nan  |                                     Functional morphology of force transmission in skeletal muscle.

Partial compared to full range of motion resistance training for muscle hypertrophy: A brief review and an identification of potential mechanisms. J Strength Cond Res 32(9): 2661-2673, 2018-Resistance training promotes skeletal muscle hypertrophy; there are specific recommendations of intensity, volume, and duration that appear to facilitate hypertrophy the greatest. However, currently, there is not a definitive consensus on optimal range of motion. It appears that the partial range of motion (pROM) mode of exercise may have some similar benefit on muscle hypertrophy as the conventional full range of motion (fROM). Because of the dynamic and multiplanar movement pattern of a multijoint resistance exercise, there may be variation in human force-length and strength-curve theories, which may influence optimal muscle force production at differing portions of a fROM. This suggests specific muscle groups may potentially be optimally recruited during a specific portion of the exercise. The majority of previous research has primarily focused on strength outcomes opposed to muscle hypertrophy. The purpose of this brief review is to highlight the limited and relative pROM literature on muscle hypertrophy and some potential pROM mechanisms that require investigation to assess any plausible relationships. Some potential mechanisms and outcomes of interest are muscle time under tension, muscle activation, and nonuniform hypertrophy. This mode of resistance exercise requires further evaluation on hypertrophic responses; if proven efficacious, it may be employed to those in rehabilitative environments and those that seek more specific regional, local hypertrophic responses such as physique competitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |      2018      |       Sep       |          J Strength Cond Res           |   32   |    9     | 2652-2664 |       nan        |   10.1519/JSC.0000000000002723   | 29985227.0 |    #2724    |      Newmire 2018      |  nan  | nan  |   Partial Compared with Full Range of Motion Resistance Training for Muscle Hypertrophy: A Brief Review and an Identification of Potential Mechanisms.   |                                                          NewmireDaniel EDEExercise Physiology and Biochemistry Lab, Department of Kinesiology, Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi, Texas.                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Newmire, DE and Willoughby, DS.

This mode of resistance exercise requires further evaluation on hypertrophic responses; if proven efficacious, it may be employed to those in rehabilitative environments and those that seek more specific regional, local hypertrophic responses such as physique competitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                            Journal of strength and conditioning research                                            |   32    |    9     | 265226642652-2664 | 2018.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              newmire, de and willoughby, ds. partial compared to full range of motion resistance training for muscle hypertrophy: a brief review and an identification of potential mechanisms. j strength cond res 32(9): 2661-2673, 2018-resistance training promotes skeletal muscle hypertrophy; there are specific recommendations of intensity, volume, and duration that appear to facilitate hypertrophy the greatest. however, currently, there is not a definitive consensus on optimal range of motion. it appears that the partial range of motion (prom) mode of exercise may have some similar benefit on muscle hypertrophy as the conventional full range of motion (from). because of the dynamic and multiplanar movement pattern of a multijoint resistance exercise, there may be variation in human force-length and strength-curve theories, which may influence optimal muscle force production at differing portions of a from. this suggests specific muscle groups may potentially be optimally recruited during a specific portion of the exercise. the majority of previous research has primarily focused on strength outcomes opposed to muscle hypertrophy. the purpose of this brief review is to highlight the limited and relative prom literature on muscle hypertrophy and some potential prom mechanisms that require investigation to assess any plausible relationships. some potential mechanisms and outcomes of interest are muscle time under tension, muscle activation, and nonuniform hypertrophy. this mode of resistance exercise requires further evaluation on hypertrophic responses; if proven efficacious, it may be employed to those in rehabilitative environments and those that seek more specific regional, local hypertrophic responses such as physique competitors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |        1        |\n",

However, the involvement of the PFMs remains misunderstood as the assessment of muscle tone is complex and requires a thorough understanding of muscle physiology in relation to the characteristics and limitations of current PFM assessment tools. The aim of this review was to describe the structures and mechanisms involved in muscle tone in normally innervated muscle, and to discuss and relate these concepts to the PFM findings in women with PVD. METHODS: A narrative overview of the literature retrieved from searches of electronic databases and hand searches. RESULTS: Muscle tone in a normally innervated muscle comprises both active (contractile) and passive (viscoelastic) components. Current methods for evaluating PFM tone such as digital palpation, ultrasound imaging, pressure perineometry, dynamometry, and electromyography may evaluate different components. Research findings suggestive of PFM hypertonicity in women with PVD include elevated general PFM tone, changes in viscoelastic properties, and at least in some women, abnormal increases in electrogenic activity. CONCLUSION: There is a growing body of evidence to support the involvement of PFM hypertonicity in the pathophysiology of PVD. Limitations of the instruments as well as their properties should be considered when evaluating PFM tone in order to obtain better insight into which component of PFM tone is assessed. Future research is required for further investigating the underlying mechanisms of PFM hypertonicity, and studying the specific effects of physiotherapeutic interventions on PFM tone in women with PVD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |      2015      |       Nov       |               J Sex Med                |   12   |    11    |  2178-89  |       nan        |        10.1111/jsm.13028         | 26745618.0 |    #2732    |  Thibault-Gagnon 2015  |  nan  | nan  |   Active and Passive Components of Pelvic Floor Muscle Tone in Women with Provoked Vestibulodynia: A Perspective Based on a Review of the Literature.    |                                                                              Thibault-GagnonStÃ©phanieSSchool of Rehabilitation Therapy, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) dysfunctions, especially elevated tone or tension, are suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of provoked vestibulodynia (PVD).

                       aim: pelvic floor muscle (pfm) dysfunctions, especially elevated tone or tension, are suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of provoked vestibulodynia (pvd). however, the involvement of the pfms remains misunderstood as the assessment of muscle tone is complex and requires a thorough understanding of muscle physiology in relation to the characteristics and limitations of current pfm assessment tools. the aim of this review was to describe the structures and mechanisms involved in muscle tone in normally innervated muscle, and to discuss and relate these concepts to the pfm findings in women with pvd. methods: a narrative overview of the literature retrieved from searches of electronic databases and hand searches. results: muscle tone in a normally innervated muscle comprises both active (contractile) and passive (viscoelastic) components. current methods for evaluating pfm tone such as digital palpation, ultrasound imaging, pressure perineometry, dynamometry, and electromyography may evaluate different components. research findings suggestive of pfm hypertonicity in women with pvd include elevated general pfm tone, changes in viscoelastic properties, and at least in some women, abnormal increases in electrogenic activity. conclusion: there is a growing body of evidence to support the involvement of pfm hypertonicity in the pathophysiology of pvd. limitations of the instruments as well as their properties should be considered when evaluating pfm tone in order to obtain better insight into which component of pfm tone is assessed. future research is required for further investigating the underlying mechanisms of pfm hypertonicity, and studying the specific effects of physiotherapeutic interventions on pfm tone in women with pvd.

Significant potassium flux from the intracellular space of contracting muscle may decrease the membrane potential to half its resting value. This is true for isolated muscle preparations as well as for the whole body exercise in humans. Specific K+ channels have been identified, that may account for the intracellular K+ loss. Calcium-sensitive K+ channels open when intracellular Ca2+ concentrations increase, as during excitation. ATP-sensitive K+ channels may be involved but may open only at ATP concentrations well below those attained at exhaustion. However, ATP may be compartmentalized and only the membrane-bound ATP concentration may be of significance. Ca2+ accumulation and ATP depletion cause cell destruction; these changes induce an increased K+ conductance, which may inactivate the membrane and consequently prevent tension development. It is hypothesized that such a safety mechanism is identical to the fatigue mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |      1991      |       Feb       |        Can J Physiol Pharmacol         |   69   |    2     |  238-45   |       nan        |         10.1139/y91-037          | 2054740.0  |    #2786    |     SjÃ¸gaard 1991     |  nan  | nan  |                                   Role of exercise-induced potassium fluxes underlying muscle fatigue: a brief review.                                   |                                                                                 SjÃ¸gaardGGDepartment of Physiology, National Institute of Occupational Health, Copenhagen, Denmark.                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The site of exercise-induced muscle fatigue is suggested to be the muscle membrane, which includes the sarcolemma and T-tubule membrane; the excitability of the membrane is dependent on the membrane potential.

It is hypothesized that such a safety mechanism is identical to the fatigue mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                           Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology                                           |   69    |    2     |   238245238-45    | 1991.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        the site of exercise-induced muscle fatigue is suggested to be the muscle membrane, which includes the sarcolemma and t-tubule membrane; the excitability of the membrane is dependent on the membrane potential. significant potassium flux from the intracellular space of contracting muscle may decrease the membrane potential to half its resting value. this is true for isolated muscle preparations as well as for the whole body exercise in humans. specific k+ channels have been identified, that may account for the intracellular k+ loss. calcium-sensitive k+ channels open when intracellular ca2+ concentrations increase, as during excitation. atp-sensitive k+ channels may be involved but may open only at atp concentrations well below those attained at exhaustion. however, atp may be compartmentalized and only the membrane-bound atp concentration may be of significance. ca2+ accumulation and atp depletion cause cell destruction; these changes induce an increased k+ conductance, which may inactivate the membrane and consequently prevent tension development. it is hypothesized that such a safety mechanism is identical to the fatigue mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |        1        |\n",

This reflex is assumed to originate in the saccule, the afferent pathways being either the vestibulocochlear nerve or the inferior vestibular nerve, and the efferent pathways the vestibulospinal tract. Averaging these muscular responses allows vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) to be obtained. The responses consist of two alternatively positive and negative successive waves (p13-n23, p33-n43). The characteristics of this reflex are defined in the literature as follows: it has been established that VEMP amplitude depends on muscular tension. All studies give concording evidence that in healthy subjects the first component of VEMP is more consistent than the second. Binaural stimulation is always responsible for responses of greater amplitude than those obtained from monaural stimulation. Following monaural stimulation, however, VEMPs are either of greater amplitude on the muscle ipsilateral to the stimulation or of the same amplitude on both muscles. There is consensus in the literature demonstrating that VEMP amplitude depends on stimulus intensity: the threshold of VEMP occurrence is clearly above auditory level but varies from one individual to the next. In the 1970s, recordings performed in cases of specific audiovestibular defects suggested that the reflex receptor could be the saccule. More recent studies suggest that the cochlea too could be involved in the response. Likewise, while a number of studies tend to demonstrate that VEMPs depend on vestibular integrity, others suggest that afferent pathways could be of both cohlear and vestibular origin. Finally, while it has been suggested that VEMP efferent pathways travel through the vestibulospinal tract, whether it is the lateral or the medial vestibulospinal tract that is concerned remains to be clarified. A few points regarding VEMP receptors and afferent and efferent pathways call for further investigation. They are inaccurate for use in routine vestibular examination. Once precise receptor localization and pathways are clarified, VEMP recording will provide both a straightforward non-invasive exploration of each vestibule independently and an attractive method by which to explore otolithic receptors and vestibulospinal pathways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |      1999      |       Jan       |            Acta Otolaryngol            |  119   |    1     |  15-Jun   |       nan        |    10.1080/00016489950181864     | 10219378.0 |    #2790    |   Ferber-Viart 1999    |  nan  | nan  |                                                Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in humans: a review.                                                |                                                             Ferber-ViartCCFÃ©dÃ©ration d'Explorations Audiovestibulaires, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite, France. roland.duclaux@chu-lyon.fr                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                  The human vestibule has preserved an ancestral sound sensitivity and it has been suggested that a reflex could originate from this property, thus inducing cervical muscle microcontractions secondary to strong acoustic stimulations.

Once precise receptor localization and pathways are clarified, VEMP recording will provide both a straightforward non-invasive exploration of each vestibule independently and an attractive method by which to explore otolithic receptors and vestibulospinal pathways.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                       Acta oto-laryngologica                                                        |   119   |    1     |      6156-15      | 1999.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     the human vestibule has preserved an ancestral sound sensitivity and it has been suggested that a reflex could originate from this property, thus inducing cervical muscle microcontractions secondary to strong acoustic stimulations. this reflex is assumed to originate in the saccule, the afferent pathways being either the vestibulocochlear nerve or the inferior vestibular nerve, and the efferent pathways the vestibulospinal tract. averaging these muscular responses allows vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (vemps) to be obtained. the responses consist of two alternatively positive and negative successive waves (p13-n23, p33-n43). the characteristics of this reflex are defined in the literature as follows: it has been established that vemp amplitude depends on muscular tension. all studies give concording evidence that in healthy subjects the first component of vemp is more consistent than the second. binaural stimulation is always responsible for responses of greater amplitude than those obtained from monaural stimulation. following monaural stimulation, however, vemps are either of greater amplitude on the muscle ipsilateral to the stimulation or of the same amplitude on both muscles. there is consensus in the literature demonstrating that vemp amplitude depends on stimulus intensity: the threshold of vemp occurrence is clearly above auditory level but varies from one individual to the next. in the 1970s, recordings performed in cases of specific audiovestibular defects suggested that the reflex receptor could be the saccule. more recent studies suggest that the cochlea too could be involved in the response. likewise, while a number of studies tend to demonstrate that vemps depend on vestibular integrity, others suggest that afferent pathways could be of both cohlear and vestibular origin. finally, while it has been suggested that vemp efferent pathways travel through the vestibulospinal tract, whether it is the lateral or the medial vestibulospinal tract that is concerned remains to be clarified. a few points regarding vemp receptors and afferent and efferent pathways call for further investigation. they are inaccurate for use in routine vestibular examination. once precise receptor localization and pathways are clarified, vemp recording will provide both a straightforward non-invasive exploration of each vestibule independently and an attractive method by which to explore otolithic receptors and vestibulospinal pathways.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |        1        |\n",

Due to the rarity of this condition, it may be missed at initial presentation and inappropriately treated, potentially leading to increased disability. OBJECTIVES: This case highlights the mechanism of injury, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of rupture of the pectoralis major. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 31-year-old male bodybuilder who presented to the Emergency Department with acute pain and swelling in the left axilla after performing a bench press with a 400-pound barbell. The diagnosis of pectoralis major rupture was suspected and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, and early surgical repair was performed. CONCLUSION: The most common mechanism of injury is excessive tension on a maximally contracted pectoralis major muscle. Weightlifting, specifically bench pressing, is a common cause. The diagnosis can usually be made based on a patient's history and physical examination, but shortly after injury, the diagnosis may be obscured by severe pain and swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice when the diagnosis remains unclear, and can avoid surgical delays. Early diagnosis and treatment within 3 to 8 weeks after the injury has the advantage of avoiding adhesions and muscle atrophy, and can prevent a delayed return to normal activities. Given the trend toward improved results with early surgical repair of complete rupture, it is important to raise awareness about pectoralis major muscle injury among Emergency Physicians to prevent missed or delayed diagnosis and repair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |      2010      |       Feb       |              J Emerg Med               |   38   |    2     |  196-200  |       nan        |  10.1016/j.jemermed.2008.01.025  | 18818044.0 |    #2797    |     Hasegawa 2010      |  nan  | nan  |                                                Rupture of the pectoralis major: a case report and review.                                                |                                                                                                 HasegawaKoheiKUnited States Naval Hospital Okinawa, Okinawa, Japan.                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rupture of the pectoralis major muscle is a rare clinical entity that is becoming more common due to the increasing popularity of weightlifting and recreational sports.

a rare clinical entity that is becoming more common due to the increasing popularity of weightlifting and recreational sports. due to the rarity of this condition, it may be missed at initial presentation and inappropriately treated, potentially leading to increased disability. this case highlights the mechanism of injury, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of rupture of the pectoralis major. case report: the patient was a 31-year-old male bodybuilder who presented to the emergency department with acute pain and swelling in the left axilla after performing a bench press with a 400-pound barbell. the diagnosis of pectoralis major rupture was suspected and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, and early surgical repair was performed. conclusion: the most common mechanism of injury is excessive tension on a maximally contracted pectoralis major muscle. weightlifting, specifically bench pressing, is a common cause. the diagnosis can usually be made based on a patient's history and physical examination, but shortly after injury, the diagnosis may be obscured by severe pain and swelling. magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice when the diagnosis remains unclear, and can avoid surgical delays. early diagnosis and treatment within 3 to 8 weeks after the injury has the advantage of avoiding adhesions and muscle atrophy, and can prevent a delayed return to normal activities. given the trend toward improved results with early surgical repair of complete rupture, it is important to raise awareness about pectoralis major muscle injury among emergency physicians to prevent missed or delayed diagnosis and repair.

This reduction in performance is temporary; permanent impairment does not occur. A number of clinical correlates are associated with DOMS, including elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure; exertional rhabdomyolysis appears to be the extreme form of DOMS. Presently, the best treatment for DOMS appears to be muscular activity, although the sensation again returns following the exercise. Training for the specific contractile activity that causes DOMS reduces the soreness response. The etiology and cellular mechanisms of DOMS are not known, but a number of hypotheses exist to explain the phenomenon. The following model may be proposed: 1) high tensions (particularly those associated with eccentric exercise) in the contractile/elastic system of the muscle result in structural damage; 2) cell membrane damage leads to disruption of Ca++ homeostasis in the injured fibers, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 2 d post-exercise; and 3) products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents accumulate in the interstitium, which in turn stimulate free nerve endings of group-IV sensory neurons in the muscles leading to the sensation of DOMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |      1984      |       Dec       |          Med Sci Sports Exerc          |   16   |    6     |  529-38   |       nan        |               nan                | 6392811.0  |    #2806    |     Armstrong 1984     |  nan  | nan  |                                     Mechanisms of exercise-induced delayed onset muscular soreness: a brief review.                                      |                                                                                                                            ArmstrongR BRB                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Delayed-onset muscular soreness (DOMS), the sensation of pain and stiffness in the muscles that occurs from 1 to 5 d following unaccustomed exercise, can adversely affect muscular performance, both from voluntary reduction of effort and from inherent loss of capacity of the muscles to produce force.

and 3) products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents accumulate in the interstitium, which in turn stimulate free nerve endings of group-IV sensory neurons in the muscles leading to the sensation of DOMS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                             Medicine and science in sports and exercise                                             |   16    |    6     |   529538529-38    | 1984.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      delayed-onset muscular soreness (doms), the sensation of pain and stiffness in the muscles that occurs from 1 to 5 d following unaccustomed exercise, can adversely affect muscular performance, both from voluntary reduction of effort and from inherent loss of capacity of the muscles to produce force. this reduction in performance is temporary; permanent impairment does not occur. a number of clinical correlates are associated with doms, including elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure; exertional rhabdomyolysis appears to be the extreme form of doms. presently, the best treatment for doms appears to be muscular activity, although the sensation again returns following the exercise. training for the specific contractile activity that causes doms reduces the soreness response. the etiology and cellular mechanisms of doms are not known, but a number of hypotheses exist to explain the phenomenon. the following model may be proposed: 1) high tensions (particularly those associated with eccentric exercise) in the contractile/elastic system of the muscle result in structural damage; 2) cell membrane damage leads to disruption of ca++ homeostasis in the injured fibers, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 2 d post-exercise; and 3) products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents accumulate in the interstitium, which in turn stimulate free nerve endings of group-iv sensory neurons in the muscles leading to the sensation of doms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |        1        |\n",

The influence of movement tempo on acute neuromuscular, hormonal, and mechanical responses to resistance exercise-a mini review. J Strength Cond Res 34(8): 2369-2383, 2020-Resistance training studies mainly analyze variables such as the type and order of exercise, intensity, number of sets, number of repetitions, and duration and frequency of rest periods. However, one variable that is often overlooked in resistance training research, as well as in practice, is premeditated movement tempo, which can influence a myriad of mechanical and physiological factors associated with training and adaptation. Specifically, this article provides an overview of the available scientific literature and describes how slower tempos negatively affect the 1-repetition maximum, the possible load to be used, and the number of repetitions performed with a given load, while also increasing the total time under tension, which can mediate acute cardiovascular and hormonal responses. As a result, coaches should consider testing maximal strength and the maximal number of repetitions that can be performed with each movement tempo that is to be used during training. Otherwise, programming resistance training using various movement tempos is more of a trial-and-error approach, rather than being evidence or practice based. Furthermore, practical applications are provided to show how movement tempo can be adjusted for a variety of case study-type scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |      2020      |       Aug       |          J Strength Cond Res           |   34   |    8     | 2369-2383 |       nan        |   10.1519/JSC.0000000000003636   | 32735429.0 |    #2831    |       Wilk 2020        |  nan  | nan  |             The Influence of Movement Tempo on Acute Neuromuscular, Hormonal, and Mechanical Responses to Resistance Exercise-A Mini Review.             |                                                                            WilkMichalMInstitute of Sport Sciences, Jerzy Kukuczka Academy of Physical Education in Katowice, Poland; and.                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wilk, M, Tufano, JJ, and Zajac, A.

Furthermore, practical applications are provided to show how movement tempo can be adjusted for a variety of case study-type scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                            Journal of strength and conditioning research                                            |   34    |    8     | 236923832369-2383 | 2020.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  wilk, m, tufano, jj, and zajac, a. the influence of movement tempo on acute neuromuscular, hormonal, and mechanical responses to resistance exercise-a mini review. j strength cond res 34(8): 2369-2383, 2020-resistance training studies mainly analyze variables such as the type and order of exercise, intensity, number of sets, number of repetitions, and duration and frequency of rest periods. however, one variable that is often overlooked in resistance training research, as well as in practice, is premeditated movement tempo, which can influence a myriad of mechanical and physiological factors associated with training and adaptation. specifically, this article provides an overview of the available scientific literature and describes how slower tempos negatively affect the 1-repetition maximum, the possible load to be used, and the number of repetitions performed with a given load, while also increasing the total time under tension, which can mediate acute cardiovascular and hormonal responses. as a result, coaches should consider testing maximal strength and the maximal number of repetitions that can be performed with each movement tempo that is to be used during training. otherwise, programming resistance training using various movement tempos is more of a trial-and-error approach, rather than being evidence or practice based. furthermore, practical applications are provided to show how movement tempo can be adjusted for a variety of case study-type scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |        1        |\n",

DATA SOURCES: The CHIROLARS database was searched for the years 1976 to 1995 with the following index terms: \"chiropractic tests,\" \"chiropractic adjusting technique,\" \"motion palpation,\" \"movement palpation,\" \"leg length,\" \"applied kinesiology,\" and \"sacrooccipital technique.\" In addition, a manual search was performed at the libraries of the Nordic Institute of Chiropractic and Clinical Biomechanics, Odense, Denmark, and the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic, Bournemouth, United Kingdom. STUDY SELECTION: Studies pertaining to intraexaminer reliability, interexaminer reliability, and/or validity of chiropractic evaluation of the lumbo-pelvic spine were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data quality were assessed independently by the two reviewers, with a quality score based on predefined methodologic criteria. Results of the studies were then evaluated in relation to quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: None of the tests studied had been sufficiently evaluated in relation to reliability and validity. Only tests for palpation for pain had consistently acceptable results. Motion palpation of the lumbar spine might be valid but showed poor reliability, whereas motion palpation of the sacroiliac joints seemed to be slightly reliable but was not shown to be valid. Measures of leg-length inequality seemed to correlate with radiographic measurements but consensus on method and interpretation is lacking. For the sacrooccipital technique, some evidence favors the validity of the arm-fossa test but the rest of the test regimen remains poorly documented. Documentation of applied kinesiology was not available. Palpation for muscle tension, palpation for misalignment, and visual inspection were either undocumented, unreliable, or not valid. CONCLUSION: The detection of the manipulative lesion in the lumbo-pelvic spine depends on valid and reliable tests. Because such tests have not been established, the presence of the manipulative lesion remains hypothetical. Great effort is needed to develop, establish, and enforce valid and reliable test procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |      2000      |       May       |      J Manipulative Physiol Ther       |   23   |    4     |  258-75   |       nan        |     10.1067/mmt.2000.106097      | 10820299.0 |    #2834    |     Hestbaek 2000      |  nan  | nan  |                      Are chiropractic tests for the lumbo-pelvic spine reliable and valid?

               to systematically review the peer-reviewed literature about the reliability and validity of chiropractic tests used to determine the need for spinal manipulative therapy of the lumbo-pelvic spine, taking into account the quality of the studies. data sources: the chirolars database was searched for the years 1976 to 1995 with the following index terms: \"chiropractic tests,\" \"chiropractic adjusting technique,\" \"motion palpation,\" \"movement palpation,\" \"leg length,\" \"applied kinesiology,\" and \"sacrooccipital technique.\" in addition, a manual search was performed at the libraries of the nordic institute of chiropractic and clinical biomechanics, odense, denmark, and the anglo-european college of chiropractic, bournemouth, united kingdom. study selection: studies pertaining to intraexaminer reliability, interexaminer reliability, and/or validity of chiropractic evaluation of the lumbo-pelvic spine were included. data extraction: data quality were assessed independently by the two reviewers, with a quality score based on predefined methodologic criteria. results of the studies were then evaluated in relation to quality. data synthesis: none of the tests studied had been sufficiently evaluated in relation to reliability and validity. only tests for palpation for pain had consistently acceptable results. motion palpation of the lumbar spine might be valid but showed poor reliability, whereas motion palpation of the sacroiliac joints seemed to be slightly reliable but was not shown to be valid. measures of leg-length inequality seemed to correlate with radiographic measurements but consensus on method and interpretation is lacking. for the sacrooccipital technique, some evidence favors the validity of the arm-fossa test but the rest of the test regimen remains poorly documented. documentation of applied kinesiology was not available. palpation for muscle tension, palpation for misalignment, and visual inspection were either undocumented, unreliable, or not valid. conclusion: the detection of the manipulative lesion in the lumbo-pelvic spine depends on valid and reliable tests. because such tests have not been established, the presence of the manipulative lesion remains hypothetical. great effort is needed to develop, establish, and enforce valid and reliable test procedures.

An overall morbidity rate of 20 percent was seen in this series. Secondary surgical procedures specific for donor-site problems were required in 7.7 percent of patients. Major complications occurred in 2.3 percent of the donor sites. From this review it is apparent that major donor-site morbidity is uncommon and most donor-site problems could probably have been avoided. Our recommendations are as follows: closure of the donor site to avoid excessive tension must be carefully planned preoperatively, donor-site anatomy and flap elevation techniques must be precisely understood, surgical retractors must be carefully placed to avoid injury to nearby structures, the donor site should be closed immediately following pedicle division, thus minimizing wound exposures, and complete surgical hemostasis is mandatory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |      1986      |       Jun       |          Plast Reconstr Surg           |   77   |    6     |  948-53   |       nan        | 10.1097/00006534-198606000-00013 | 2940612.0  |    #3026    |       Colen 1986       |  nan  | nan  |                                                  Review of the morbidity of 300 free-flap donor sites.                                                   |                                                                                                                              ColenS RSR                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Donor-site morbidity in 300 consecutive free flaps was reviewed to identify their etiologies and potentially prevent their recurrence in future cases.

potentially prevent their recurrence in future cases. an overall morbidity rate of 20 percent was seen in this series. secondary surgical procedures specific for donor-site problems were required in 7.7 percent of patients. major complications occurred in 2.3 percent of the donor sites. from this review it is apparent that major donor-site morbidity is uncommon and most donor-site problems could probably have been avoided. our recommendations are as follows: closure of the donor site to avoid excessive tension must be carefully planned preoperatively, donor-site anatomy and flap elevation techniques must be precisely understood, surgical retractors must be carefully placed to avoid injury to nearby structures, the donor site should be closed immediately following pedicle division, thus minimizing wound exposures, and complete surgical hemostasis is mandatory.

The scientific basis for eccentric quasi-isometric resistance training: A narrative review. J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2846-2859, 2019-Eccentric quasi-isometric (EQI) resistance training involves holding a submaximal, yielding isometric contraction until fatigue causes muscle lengthening and then maximally resisting through a range of motion. Practitioners contend that EQI contractions are a powerful tool for the development of several physical qualities important to health and sports performance. In addition, several sports involve regular quasi-isometric contractions for optimal performance. Therefore, the primary objective of this review was to synthesize and critically analyze relevant biological, physiological, and biomechanical research and develop a rationale for the value of EQI training. In addition, this review offers potential practical applications and highlights future areas of research. Although there is a paucity of research investigating EQIs, the literature on responses to traditional contraction types is vast. Based on the relevant literature, EQIs may provide a practical means of increasing total volume, metabolite build-up, and hormonal signaling factors while safely enduring large quantities of mechanical tension with low levels of peak torque. Conversely, EQI contractions likely hold little neuromuscular specificity to high velocity or power movements. Therefore, EQI training seems to be effective for improving musculotendinous morphological and performance variables with low injury risk. Although speculative due to the limited specific literature, available evidence suggests a case for future experimentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |      2019      |       Oct       |          J Strength Cond Res           |   33   |    10    | 2846-2859 |       nan        |   10.1519/JSC.0000000000003291   | 31361732.0 |    #3145    |     Oranchuk 2019      |  nan  | nan  |                                 Scientific Basis for Eccentric Quasi-Isometric Resistance Training: A Narrative Review.                                  |                                                                    OranchukDustin JDJSports Performance Research Institute New Zealand, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand.                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Oranchuk, DJ, Storey, AG, Nelson, AR, and Cronin, JB.

Although speculative due to the limited specific literature, available evidence suggests a case for future experimentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                            Journal of strength and conditioning research                                            |   33    |    10    | 284628592846-2859 | 2019.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               oranchuk, dj, storey, ag, nelson, ar, and cronin, jb. the scientific basis for eccentric quasi-isometric resistance training: a narrative review. j strength cond res 33(10): 2846-2859, 2019-eccentric quasi-isometric (eqi) resistance training involves holding a submaximal, yielding isometric contraction until fatigue causes muscle lengthening and then maximally resisting through a range of motion. practitioners contend that eqi contractions are a powerful tool for the development of several physical qualities important to health and sports performance. in addition, several sports involve regular quasi-isometric contractions for optimal performance. therefore, the primary objective of this review was to synthesize and critically analyze relevant biological, physiological, and biomechanical research and develop a rationale for the value of eqi training. in addition, this review offers potential practical applications and highlights future areas of research. although there is a paucity of research investigating eqis, the literature on responses to traditional contraction types is vast. based on the relevant literature, eqis may provide a practical means of increasing total volume, metabolite build-up, and hormonal signaling factors while safely enduring large quantities of mechanical tension with low levels of peak torque. conversely, eqi contractions likely hold little neuromuscular specificity to high velocity or power movements. therefore, eqi training seems to be effective for improving musculotendinous morphological and performance variables with low injury risk. although speculative due to the limited specific literature, available evidence suggests a case for future experimentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |        1        |\n",

METHOD: A search of 12 electronic databases and reference lists for studies published between the years 1990-2014 was conducted using the PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion and exclusion criteria included type of publication, participant characteristics, intervention, outcome measures and report of outcomes. Methodological quality rating scales and confidence in diagnostic scale supported the literature evaluation. RESULT: Seven papers met the inclusion criteria. Significant improvement on at least one outcome measure was reported for all studies. Effect sizes were small-to-large. Methodological qualities of research were varied. No study explicitly reported treatment fidelity and cumulative intervention intensity could only be calculated for two out of seven studies. Outcome measures were used inconsistently and less than half of the measures had reported reliability values. Confidence in the accuracy of subject diagnosis on average was rated as low. Specific \"active ingredients\" for therapeutic change were not identified. CONCLUSION: Voice therapy for the treatment of MTVD is associated with positive treatment outcomes; however, there is an obvious need for systematic and high quality research designs to expand the evidence base for the behavioural treatment of MTVD.

voice disorders (mtvd). method: a search of 12 electronic databases and reference lists for studies published between the years 1990-2014 was conducted using the prisma guidelines. inclusion and exclusion criteria included type of publication, participant characteristics, intervention, outcome measures and report of outcomes. methodological quality rating scales and confidence in diagnostic scale supported the literature evaluation. result: seven papers met the inclusion criteria. significant improvement on at least one outcome measure was reported for all studies. effect sizes were small-to-large. methodological qualities of research were varied. no study explicitly reported treatment fidelity and cumulative intervention intensity could only be calculated for two out of seven studies. outcome measures were used inconsistently and less than half of the measures had reported reliability values. confidence in the accuracy of subject diagnosis on average was rated as low. specific \"active ingredients\" for therapeutic change were not identified. conclusion: voice therapy for the treatment of mtvd is associated with positive treatment outcomes; however, there is an obvious need for systematic and high quality research designs to expand the evidence base for the behavioural treatment of mtvd.

Liuzijue Qigong is a kind of traditional Chinese Qigong exercises that Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners prescribe to individuals with COPD to strengthen the internal organs' function. Liuzijue Qigong was recommended for use in COPD rehabilitation, and some clinical trials indicate that Liuzijue Qigong would produce better functional capacity and quality of life of individuals with COPD. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the existing studies to assess effectiveness and safety of Liuzijue Qigong for the prevention or treatment of COPD in patients. METHODS: We will perform the comprehensive literature search in English and Chinese electronic database. The publication period will be from inception to the search date. In addition, the clinical trial registries, dissertations, informal publication, grey literature, reference lists of studies, systematic reviews, and conference abstracts will also be collected. Two reviewers will identify relevant studies, extract data information, and then assess the methodical quality by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Only randomized controlled trials comparing Liuzijue Qigong against other intervention or nonintervention will be included. Data will be synthesized by either fixed-effect or random-effect model regarding to a heterogeneity test. The routine lung function, arterial blood gas tensions, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, functional capacity, 30 seconds sit-to-stand test, respiratory function, maximal inspiration pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, airway resistance, and specific airway conductance will be assessed as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes involved dyspnea, and fatigue levels, respiratory muscle strength, upper and lower limb muscle strength, handgrip strength test, and health-related quality of life and safety. Meta-analysis will be performed by using Cochrane's Review Manager software (version 5.3.5). RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide a high-quality synthesis and evaluate the efficacy and safety based on current relevant literature evidence of Liuzijue Qigong intervention for COPD patient. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review will provide evidence to determine whether Liuzijue Qigong is an effective and safe approach to prevention and treatment of COPD patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |      2018      |       Oct       |          Medicine (Baltimore)          |   97   |    40    |  e12659   |       nan        |   10.1097/MD.0000000000012659    | 30290646.0 |    #3402    |        Guo 2018        |  nan  | nan  |          Effect of Liuzijue Qigong on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.           |                                                GuoYuYSchool of Acupuncture-Moxibustion and Tuina, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing.Ovation Health Science and Technology Co.

obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with a substantial and increasing social and economic burden. liuzijue qigong is a kind of traditional chinese qigong exercises that traditional chinese medicine practitioners prescribe to individuals with copd to strengthen the internal organs' function. liuzijue qigong was recommended for use in copd rehabilitation, and some clinical trials indicate that liuzijue qigong would produce better functional capacity and quality of life of individuals with copd. the objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the existing studies to assess effectiveness and safety of liuzijue qigong for the prevention or treatment of copd in patients. methods: we will perform the comprehensive literature search in english and chinese electronic database. the publication period will be from inception to the search date. in addition, the clinical trial registries, dissertations, informal publication, grey literature, reference lists of studies, systematic reviews, and conference abstracts will also be collected. two reviewers will identify relevant studies, extract data information, and then assess the methodical quality by the cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. only randomized controlled trials comparing liuzijue qigong against other intervention or nonintervention will be included. data will be synthesized by either fixed-effect or random-effect model regarding to a heterogeneity test. the routine lung function, arterial blood gas tensions, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, functional capacity, 30 seconds sit-to-stand test, respiratory function, maximal inspiration pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, airway resistance, and specific airway conductance will be assessed as primary outcomes. the secondary outcomes involved dyspnea, and fatigue levels, respiratory muscle strength, upper and lower limb muscle strength, handgrip strength test, and health-related quality of life and safety. meta-analysis will be performed by using cochrane's review manager software (version 5.3.5). results: this systematic review and meta-analysis will provide a high-quality synthesis and evaluate the efficacy and safety based on current relevant literature evidence of liuzijue qigong intervention for copd patient. conclusion: our systematic review will provide evidence to determine whether liuzijue qigong is an effective and safe approach to prevention and treatment of copd patients.

Much basic research has been conducted in the area of increasing a muscle's fatigue resistance by neuromuscular electrical stimulation but similarly thorough research with regard to increasing maximal force is missing. Insufficient clinical and basic knowledge exists on the selection of stimulation parameters that will optimize muscle hypertrophy and gains in muscle force. For volitional training, established stimuli for muscle hypertrophy (which more or less parallels maximal muscle force) are muscle tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage. The present review summarizes findings from clinical and basic research in terms of muscle mechanical as well as acute and chronic physiologic effects of different stimulation protocols, explains the role of the various stimulation parameters in determining the effect of NMES training protocols, and gives clinical recommendations for the choice of stimulation parameters for different patient populations with different training goals, such as increasing muscle force, mass, endurance, or energy consumption. We limit this review to non-neurologic patients, because training goals of neurologic patients are specific to their functional deficits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |      2015      |       Nov       |                  PM R                  |   7    |    11    | 1167-1178 |       nan        |    10.1016/j.pmrj.2015.03.022    | 25839763.0 |    #3506    |      Herzig 2015       |  nan  | nan  |           The Application of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation Training in Various Non-neurologic Patient Populations: A Narrative Review.            |                                                           HerzigDavidDPreventive Cardiology and Sports Medicine, University Clinic for Cardiology, Inselspital, University Hospital of Berne, Switzerland.                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In the last 2 decades, neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been used increasingly in deconditioned patients with the aim of increasing muscle force.

We limit this review to non-neurologic patients, because training goals of neurologic patients are specific to their functional deficits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                    PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation                                     |    7    |    11    | 116711781167-1178 | 2015.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  in the last 2 decades, neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been used increasingly in deconditioned patients with the aim of increasing muscle force. much basic research has been conducted in the area of increasing a muscle's fatigue resistance by neuromuscular electrical stimulation but similarly thorough research with regard to increasing maximal force is missing. insufficient clinical and basic knowledge exists on the selection of stimulation parameters that will optimize muscle hypertrophy and gains in muscle force. for volitional training, established stimuli for muscle hypertrophy (which more or less parallels maximal muscle force) are muscle tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage. the present review summarizes findings from clinical and basic research in terms of muscle mechanical as well as acute and chronic physiologic effects of different stimulation protocols, explains the role of the various stimulation parameters in determining the effect of nmes training protocols, and gives clinical recommendations for the choice of stimulation parameters for different patient populations with different training goals, such as increasing muscle force, mass, endurance, or energy consumption. we limit this review to non-neurologic patients, because training goals of neurologic patients are specific to their functional deficits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |        1        |\n",

Since its introduction in 1995, several other tapes and other minimally invasive treatments have arisen. The transobturator tape (TOT) procedure reproduces the natural suspension of the urethra through the obturator and puborectalis muscles. The TOT procedure was reportedly developed in an effort to prevent bladder perforation associated with the TVT and is generally considered to be a procedure with low morbidity. At our institution, we report the first case of infected mesh with subsequent myositis of adductor muscles after a TOT procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting this complication, citing specifically that the anatomical structures traversed by the tape, including both muscle and fascia, can be at risk for infection and ultimately require removal of the sling material. We performed a MEDLINE literature search using key words such as \"transobturator tape,\" \"tension free vaginal tape,\" and \"adductor and obturator complications\" to ascertain any reported adductor or obturator muscle complications after placement of TOT. Further, we reviewed the literature to elucidate the consequences of using different mesh materials, specifically their effects on erosion. We reported our case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with right-leg cellulitis and vaginal discharge after having a TOT placed for stress incontinence. Inflammation of the adductor muscles was demonstrated on computed tomography (CT) scan and ultrasound. On physical exam, the mesh had visibly eroded through the vaginal wall. Our patient underwent excision of the mesh material. She ultimately had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home in good condition on the postoperative day 2. The mesh material removed was ObTape. We believe our study is the first case report to discuss the complication of infected adductor muscles and erosion of the tape during post-TOT procedure. After a careful review of the literature, there is no mention of myositis of adductor muscles as a possible complication after the TOT procedure. In fact, the literature has deemed this minimally invasive treatment as a safe and effective procedure with minimal complications including only de novo urgency or urinary retention. The site of infection is of particular interest and can be explained by the course through the anatomical structures that are unique to this particular procedure. Ultimately, the treatment for this procedure was the removal of the mesh along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In conclusion, the burden falls upon the surgeons to report in a timely fashion both successes and complication for the TOT procedure given their relatively limited experience. This is paramount in determining patients' risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |      2007      |       Jul       | Int Urogynecol J Pelvic Floor Dysfunct |   18   |    7     |  817-20   |       nan        |    10.1007/s00192-006-0220-9     | 17577593.0 |    #3537    |      DeSouza 2007      |  nan  | nan  |                      Adductor brevis myositis following transobturator tape procedure: a case report and review of the literature.                       |                                             DeSouzaRowenaRDivision of Urology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, 6431 Fannin St., Suite 6.018, Houston, TX 77030, USA. rowenadesouza@hotmail.com                                             | The tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) procedure has long been considered the gold standard for female stress incontinence.

Supportive laboratory research on the intervention procedures and cost-efficiency of electromyographic feedback and relaxation instructions are discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                       Psychosomatic medicine                                                        |   41    |    2     |   165180165-80    | 1979.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  studies involving behavioral intervention with muscle-contraction headache are reviewed. intervention approaches have most frequently involved frontal electromyographic feedback and relaxation instructions. although behavioral intervention packages have been more effective than control procedures in reducing headache activity, identification of active components of these packages is difficult. specifically,, the contribution of placebo, expectancy and demand factors, reactive effects of self-monitoring, and home practice have not been adequately assessed. the importance of assessing individual differences in etiology and in response to intervention is stressed. the results of some studies are congruent with the hypothesized muscle tension etiology of muscle-contraction headaches but the results from others suggest that factors other than muscle-tension may be involved. supportive laboratory research on the intervention procedures and cost-efficiency of electromyographic feedback and relaxation instructions are discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |        1        |\n",

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated, with a scoping review, the use of infrared thermography in complementary assessments of human head and neck muscles to determine the extent of research on the topic, what methodologies are used in thermal assessment and thermographic analysis, what regions are assessed, and what results are expected in thermography. METHODS: LILACS, MEDLINE, SciELO, and Web of Science were the databases searched to identify articles published on the topic, with no restriction of language or time of publication. Descriptive, analytical, and experimental observational studies on the assessment of the human head and neck muscle surface temperature with infrared thermography were included. Case studies, case series, methodological accuracy, literature review, animal studies, studies that assessed patients with head and neck cancer, and studies that did not assess head and neck muscle temperature with thermography were excluded. The articles were analysed with a protocol developed by the authors, with data on author, year, country, type of study, sample characterisation, muscles assessed, outcomes investigated, thermal assessment methodology, thermographic analysis methodology and thermography measurements. RESULTS: This review identified and analysed 27 articles. The studies assessed thermal distribution in normal individuals and those with pathologies related to hyper- and hypofunctional head and neck muscle conditions for diagnosis or therapeutic follow-up. The masseter, temporal, digastric, anterior cervical region, orbicularis oris, frontalis, buccinator, suprahyoid, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and levator scapulae muscles were assessed. Quantitative analyses with area selection tool predominated, considering absolute temperatures and temperature differences. The studies investigated temperature and its relationship with myogenic pain, quantitative assessment of muscle parameters and blood flow velocity. The mean temperature ranged from 32.97ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°C (ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±2.21) to 34.90ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°C, and hyper-radiant and/or asymmetric regions were observed in hyperfunctional conditions and normal subjects after muscle activation. CONCLUSION: Thermography is used in complementary assessments of head and neck muscles, identifying hyper-radiant regions and thermal asymmetry related to muscle tension and activation state. Papers are limited to specific clinical conditions and few muscle groups, besides having great methodological variability.

thermography has the potential to help assess human head and neck muscles, as thermal variation measurements due to muscle imbalance can contribute to the evaluation and therapeutic follow-up of various clinical conditions in the field of health. this study investigated, with a scoping review, the use of infrared thermography in complementary assessments of human head and neck muscles to determine the extent of research on the topic, what methodologies are used in thermal assessment and thermographic analysis, what regions are assessed, and what results are expected in thermography. methods: lilacs, medline, scielo, and web of science were the databases searched to identify articles published on the topic, with no restriction of language or time of publication. descriptive, analytical, and experimental observational studies on the assessment of the human head and neck muscle surface temperature with infrared thermography were included. case studies, case series, methodological accuracy, literature review, animal studies, studies that assessed patients with head and neck cancer, and studies that did not assess head and neck muscle temperature with thermography were excluded. the articles were analysed with a protocol developed by the authors, with data on author, year, country, type of study, sample characterisation, muscles assessed, outcomes investigated, thermal assessment methodology, thermographic analysis methodology and thermography measurements. results: this review identified and analysed 27 articles. the studies assessed thermal distribution in normal individuals and those with pathologies related to hyper- and hypofunctional head and neck muscle conditions for diagnosis or therapeutic follow-up. the masseter, temporal, digastric, anterior cervical region, orbicularis oris, frontalis, buccinator, suprahyoid, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and levator scapulae muscles were assessed. quantitative analyses with area selection tool predominated, considering absolute temperatures and temperature differences. the studies investigated temperature and its relationship with myogenic pain, quantitative assessment of muscle parameters and blood flow velocity. the mean temperature ranged from 32.97ãâãâãâãâ°c (ãâãâãâãâ±2.21) to 34.90ãâãâãâãâ°c, and hyper-radiant and/or asymmetric regions were observed in hyperfunctional conditions and normal subjects after muscle activation. conclusion: thermography is used in complementary assessments of head and neck muscles, identifying hyper-radiant regions and thermal asymmetry related to muscle tension and activation state. papers are limited to specific clinical conditions and few muscle groups, besides having great methodological variability.

TH is often accompanied by a migraine and an abuse of analgesics and/or ergotamine. In the etiology of TH vascular, muscular and psychogenic factors are assumed. Floating transitions to common migraine are discussed. The increased muscle tension is not specific for TH, but more probably a consequence of TH. In addition a decrease of the pain threshold with a deficiency of the antinociceptive system is supposed. The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressives in TH is based on potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms and - besides their analgetic potencies - upon an increase of the pain threshold. TH prophylaxis is indicated if patients suffer from TH more than ten times per month. Medication are tricyclic antidepressives of the amitriptyline-type. Prophylaxis of TH can only be successful if a simultaneous abuse of analgesics and/or ergotamine is discontinued. In addition, EMG-biofeedback, as well as relaxation - and vasoconstriction training might be helpful in specific cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |      1988      |       Dec       |       Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr        |   56   |    12    |  407-22   |       nan        |      10.1055/s-2007-1001804      | 3069680.0  |    #3585    |    Pfaffenrath 1988    |  nan  | nan  |                                                              [Tension headache--a review].                                                               |                                                                                                             PfaffenrathVVGemeinschaftspraxis, MÃ¼nchen.                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Tension headache (TH) is an ill-defined headache syndrome, characterized by bilateral, daily headaches with fronto-occipital localisation.

In addition, EMG-biofeedback, as well as relaxation - and vasoconstriction training might be helpful in specific cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                               Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie                                               |   56    |    12    |   407422407-22    | 1988.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             tension headache (th) is an ill-defined headache syndrome, characterized by bilateral, daily headaches with fronto-occipital localisation. th is often accompanied by a migraine and an abuse of analgesics and/or ergotamine. in the etiology of th vascular, muscular and psychogenic factors are assumed. floating transitions to common migraine are discussed. the increased muscle tension is not specific for th, but more probably a consequence of th. in addition a decrease of the pain threshold with a deficiency of the antinociceptive system is supposed. the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressives in th is based on potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms and - besides their analgetic potencies - upon an increase of the pain threshold. th prophylaxis is indicated if patients suffer from th more than ten times per month. medication are tricyclic antidepressives of the amitriptyline-type. prophylaxis of th can only be successful if a simultaneous abuse of analgesics and/or ergotamine is discontinued. in addition, emg-biofeedback, as well as relaxation - and vasoconstriction training might be helpful in specific cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |        1        |\n",

Integrating these smart mobile devices into the workplace creates new opportunities and challenges for occupational health and safety. OBJECTIVES: Therefore the aim of the following scoping review was to identify ergonomic challenges with the use of smart mobile devices at work with respect to physical problems. METHOD: A review of 36 papers based on literature including January 2016 was conducted. RESULTS: Biomechanical measures in the reviewed studies demonstrated i.e., head flexion angles exceeding 20ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ° in 20 out of 26 different conditions described. Furthermore, laterally deviated wrists were frequently noted and thumb and finger flexor muscle activities generally greater than 5% MVC were reported. CONCLUSION: The reviewed literature indicated an elevated biomechanical risk, especially for the neck, the wrists and thumb. This was due to poor posture, ongoing and intermitted muscle tension, and/or repetitive movements. Papers addressing specific risks for smartphone and tablet use in different work environments are scarce. As the technology, as well as the use of smart mobile devices is rapidly changing, further research, especially for prolonged periods in the workplace is needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |      2018      |       nan       |                  Work                  |   59   |    2     |  273-283  |       nan        |        10.3233/WOR-172678        | 29355129.0 |    #3670    |     Tegtmeier 2018     |  nan  | nan  |                                              A scoping review on smart mobile devices and physical strain.                                               |                                              TegtmeierPatriciaPFederal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA), Unit Human Factors, Ergonomics, Dortmund, Germany.

challenges for occupational health and safety. therefore the aim of the following scoping review was to identify ergonomic challenges with the use of smart mobile devices at work with respect to physical problems. method: a review of 36 papers based on literature including january 2016 was conducted. results: biomechanical measures in the reviewed studies demonstrated i.e., head flexion angles exceeding 20ãâãâãâãâ° in 20 out of 26 different conditions described. furthermore, laterally deviated wrists were frequently noted and thumb and finger flexor muscle activities generally greater than 5% mvc were reported. conclusion: the reviewed literature indicated an elevated biomechanical risk, especially for the neck, the wrists and thumb. this was due to poor posture, ongoing and intermitted muscle tension, and/or repetitive movements. papers addressing specific risks for smartphone and tablet use in different work environments are scarce. as the technology, as well as the use of smart mobile devices is rapidly changing, further research, especially for prolonged periods in the workplace is needed.

Drawing upon two recently published meta-analyses, data from 150 outcome studies, including randomized controlled trials as well as uncontrolled quasi-experimental designs, were screened. Of these, 94 studies were selected for inclusion according to predefined criteria. Meta-analytic integrations were carried out separately for the two conditions of interest. The main results were medium-to-large mean effect sizes for biofeedback in adult migraine and tension-type headache patients. Treatment effects remained stable over an average follow-up period of 14 months, both in completer and intention-to-treat analyses. Headache frequency was the primary outcome variable and showed the largest improvements. Further significant effects were shown for perceived self-efficacy, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and medication consumption. Reduced muscle tension in pain related areas was observed in electromyographic feedback for tension-type headache. Biofeedback was more effective than waiting list and headache monitoring conditions in all cases, while electromyographic feedback for tension-type headache showed additional significant effects over placebo and relaxation therapies. Levels of efficacy (migraine: efficacious, level 4; tension-type headache: efficacious and specific, level 5) and recommendations for future research are provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |      2008      |       Sep       |     Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback     |   33   |    3     |  125-40   |       nan        |    10.1007/s10484-008-9060-3     | 18726688.0 |    #3682    |     Nestoriuc 2008     |  nan  | nan  |                                      Biofeedback treatment for headache disorders: a comprehensive efficacy review.                                      |                                                            NestoriucYvonneYDepartment of Psychiatry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02120, USA. ynestoriuc@partners.org                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The aim of the present review was to critically evaluate the documented evidence regarding the efficacy of biofeedback for the two most prevalent headache conditions--migraine and tension-type headache.

                            in the \"headache world,\" great attention has always been paid to migraine patients, especially for the research and development of new therapies. for the other forms of primary headaches, especially those of chapters 2 and 3 of the classification, there are however therapies that, even if not specific, can give significant results. tension-type headache recognizes in nsaids the most effective drugs to treat acute attack, while prevention is based on the use of tricyclic antidepressants and muscle relaxants. for tacs, the discussion is more complex: first of all, there are two forms of primary headache that respond absolutely to indomethacin. for these, the main problem is how to manage the possible side effects arising from prolonged treatments and possibly what to use as an alternative. for cluster headaches and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks, we have drugs with good efficacy as regards medical therapy, such as verapamil or lamotrigine, but in recent years, neuromodulation techniques, both surgical and non-invasive, have also been affirming themselves, which represent a more possibility for forms of headache that are often very disabling and resistant to common analgesics.

Most headaches are benign, but all require appropriate assessment. Common types include sinusitis, migraine, and muscle contraction (tension). Headache assessment includes both history and physical examination. The headache history consists of the history of present illness, past history, family history, and environmental and social history. Physical examination begins with general observation and vital sign measurement and proceeds to specific inspection of the head, neck, and facial structures. The nursing interventions carried out are dependent on the interpretation of assessment findings. Pharmacologic interventions, commonly acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may be appropriate if pain management protocols exist. Nonpharmacologic strategies for headache relief include reassurance, rest, ingestion of simple and complex carbohydrate foods, relaxation exercises, or home care. Children with migraine headaches benefit from specific interventions, and children exhibiting headache warning signs should have emergency measures instituted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |      2001      |       Jun       |               J Sch Nurs               |   17   |    3     |   120-5   |       nan        |   10.1177/10598405010170030201   | 11885441.0 |    #3739    |       Kolar 2001       |  nan  | nan  |                                                 \"Nurse, my head hurts\": a review of childhood headaches.                                                 |                                                                KolarK RKRDepartment of Women's and Children's Health, School of Nursing, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA.                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Headache, a frequent occurrence during childhood, can have a number of etiologies.

Children with migraine headaches benefit from specific interventions, and children exhibiting headache warning signs should have emergency measures instituted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                The Journal of school nursing : the official publication of the National Association of School Nurses                |   17    |    3     |    120125120-5    | 2001.0 |            nan             |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     headache, a frequent occurrence during childhood, can have a number of etiologies. most headaches are benign, but all require appropriate assessment. common types include sinusitis, migraine, and muscle contraction (tension). headache assessment includes both history and physical examination. the headache history consists of the history of present illness, past history, family history, and environmental and social history. physical examination begins with general observation and vital sign measurement and proceeds to specific inspection of the head, neck, and facial structures. the nursing interventions carried out are dependent on the interpretation of assessment findings. pharmacologic interventions, commonly acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may be appropriate if pain management protocols exist. nonpharmacologic strategies for headache relief include reassurance, rest, ingestion of simple and complex carbohydrate foods, relaxation exercises, or home care. children with migraine headaches benefit from specific interventions, and children exhibiting headache warning signs should have emergency measures instituted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |        1        |\n",

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome of unknown etiology involving generalized chronic pain accompanied, in a high percentage of cases, by other symptoms such as asthenia, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and other less frequent symptoms, such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD). DATA: Data were compiled by two experienced examiners following a specific form. SOURCES: An electronic search was carried out in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PUBMED, and SCOPUS electronic databases (up to April 2016, unrestricted by date or language). STUDY SELECTION: Comparative clinical studies with patients with both clinical pictures involving the study of pathogenic processes. CONCLUSIONS: Fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorders with muscle pain both have profiles that affect the muscular system and therefore share many epidemiological, clinical, and physiopathological symptoms. Because of this, we are led to think that there is, if not a common etiology, at least a common pathogenesis. This article revises the physiopathological processes of both clinical pictures in an attempt to determine their similarities and likenesses. This would undoubtedly help in providing a better therapeutic approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |      2017      |       Mar       |             Mod Rheumatol              |   27   |    2     |  210-216  |       nan        |  10.1080/14397595.2016.1221788   | 27539739.0 |    #3751    | Moreno-FernÃ¡ndez 2017 |  nan  | nan  |                                   Fibromyalgia syndrome and temporomandibular disorders with muscular pain.

temporomandibular disorders (tmd) refer to a group of clinical picture affecting the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joint that are characterized by muscular or joint pain, dysfunction (limited or altered functions) and joint noises, as well as other associated symptoms, such as tension headaches, otalgia, dizziness, tinnitus, and others. fibromyalgia (fm) is a syndrome of unknown etiology involving generalized chronic pain accompanied, in a high percentage of cases, by other symptoms such as asthenia, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and other less frequent symptoms, such as temporomandibular disorders (tmd). data: data were compiled by two experienced examiners following a specific form. sources: an electronic search was carried out in the cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), pubmed, and scopus electronic databases (up to april 2016, unrestricted by date or language). study selection: comparative clinical studies with patients with both clinical pictures involving the study of pathogenic processes. conclusions: fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorders with muscle pain both have profiles that affect the muscular system and therefore share many epidemiological, clinical, and physiopathological symptoms. because of this, we are led to think that there is, if not a common etiology, at least a common pathogenesis. this article revises the physiopathological processes of both clinical pictures in an attempt to determine their similarities and likenesses. this would undoubtedly help in providing a better therapeutic approach.

Many procedures have been described to restore intrinsic function following ulnar nerve palsy. There are many biomechanical issues involved in tendon transfers, including choice of muscle-tendon unit, route, insertion site, tension and drag. The surgeon, therefore, should have a good understanding of biomechanical principles to ensure optimal results. In this article the principles of biomechanics are reviewed with specific reference to tendon transfers for intrinsic reconstruction in ulnar palsy, along with their practical implications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |      2010      |       Feb       |          J Hand Surg Eur Vol           |   35   |    2     |  94-102   |       nan        |     10.1177/1753193408091569     | 19592605.0 |    #3761    |      Schwarz 2010      |  nan  | nan  |                                          A review of the biomechanics of intrinsic replacement in ulnar palsy.                                           |                                                                                 SchwarzR JRJGreen Pastures Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre, Pokhara, Nepal. rlschwarz@hotmail.com                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The actions of the interossei and lumbricals are many and their loss causes significant impairment of hand function.

Spasmodic dysphonia is a task-specific focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by irregular and uncontrolled voice breaks. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, and there are diagnostic difficulties. Data Sources PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Review Methods The data sources were searched using the following search terms: ( spasmodic dysphonia or laryngeal dystonia) and ( etiology, aetiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, or pathophysiology). Conclusion The diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia can be difficult due to the lack of a scientific consensus on diagnostic criteria and the fact that other voice disorders may present similarly. Confusion can arise between spasmodic dysphonia and muscle tension dysphonia. Spasmodic dysphonia symptoms are tied to particular speech sounds, whereas muscle tension dysphonia is not. With the advent of more widespread use of high-speed laryngoscopy and videokymography, measures of the disruptions in phonation and delays in the onset of vocal fold vibration after vocal fold closure can be quantified. Recent technological developments have expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology of spasmodic dysphonia. Implications for Practice A 3-tiered approach, involving a questionnaire, followed by speech assessment and nasolaryngoscopy is the most widely accepted method for making the diagnosis in most cases. More experimental and invasive techniques such as electromyography and neuroimaging have been explored to further characterize spasmodic dysphonia and aid in diagnosing difficult cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |      2017      |       Oct       |       Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg       |  157   |    4     |  558-564  |       nan        |     10.1177/0194599817728465     | 28850796.0 |    #3764    |      Hintze 2017       |  nan  | nan  |                                       Spasmodic Dysphonia: A Review.

Despite their widespread use, the efficacy, safety, and methodology of TPIs have not been reviewed specifically for headache disorders by expert consensus. METHODS: The Peripheral Nerve Blocks and Other Interventional Procedures Special Interest Section of the American Headache Society over a series of meetings reached a consensus for nomenclature, indications, contraindications, precautions, procedural details, outcomes, and adverse effects for the use of TPIs for headache disorders. A subcommittee of the Section also reviewed the literature. RESULTS: Indications for TPIs may include many types of episodic and chronic primary and secondary headache disorders, with the presence of active trigger points (TPs) on physical examination. Contraindications may include infection, a local open skull defect, or an anesthetic allergy, and precautions are necessary in the setting of anticoagulant use, pregnancy, and obesity with unclear anatomical landmarks. The most common muscles selected for TPIs include the trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis, with bupivacaine and lidocaine the agents used most frequently. Adverse effects are typically mild with careful patient and procedural selection, though pneumothorax and other serious adverse events have been infrequently reported. CONCLUSIONS: When performed in the appropriate setting and with the proper expertise, TPIs seem to have a role in the adjunctive treatment of the most common headache disorders. We hope our effort to characterize the methodology of TPIs by expert opinion in the context of published data motivates the performance of evidence-based and standardized treatment protocols.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |      2014      |       Oct       |                Headache                |   54   |    9     |  1441-59  |       nan        |        10.1111/head.12442        | 25168295.0 |    #3778    |      Robbins 2014      |  nan  | nan  |                           Trigger point injections for headache disorders: expert consensus methodology and narrative review.                            |                                                                     RobbinsMatthew SMSMontefiore Headache Center, Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        To review the existing literature and describe a standardized methodology by expert consensus for the performance of trigger point injections (TPIs) in the treatment of headache disorders.

trigger point injections (tpis) in the treatment of headache disorders. despite their widespread use, the efficacy, safety, and methodology of tpis have not been reviewed specifically for headache disorders by expert consensus. methods: the peripheral nerve blocks and other interventional procedures special interest section of the american headache society over a series of meetings reached a

physical examination. contraindications may include infection, a local open skull defect, or an anesthetic allergy, and precautions are necessary in the setting of anticoagulant use, pregnancy, and obesity with unclear anatomical landmarks. the most common muscles selected for tpis include the trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis, with bupivacaine and lidocaine the agents used most

DESIGN/METHODS: A systematic review identified relevant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of children, adults, or both with high levels of needle fear, including phobia (if not available, then populations with other specific phobias were included). Critically important outcomes were self-reported fear specific to the feared situation and stimulus (psychological interventions) or fainting (applied muscle tension). Data were pooled using standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The systematic review included 11 trials. In vivo exposure-based therapy for children 7 years and above showed benefit on specific fear (n=234; SMD: -1.71 [95% CI: -2.72, -0.7]). In vivo exposure-based therapy with adults reduced fear of needles posttreatment (n=20; SMD: -1.09 [-2.04, -0.14]) but not at 1-year follow-up (n=20; SMD: -0.28 [-1.16, 0.6]). Compared with single session, a benefit was observed for multiple sessions of exposure-based therapy posttreatment (n=93; SMD: -0.66 [-1.08, -0.24]) but not after 1 year (n=83; SMD: -0.37 [-0.87, 0.13]). Non in vivo e.g., imaginal exposure-based therapy in children reduced specific fear posttreatment (n=41; SMD: -0.88 [-1.7, -0.05]) and at 3 months (n=24; SMD: -0.89 [-1.73, -0.04]). Non in vivo exposure-based therapy for adults showed benefit on specific fear (n=68; SMD: -0.62 [-1.11, -0.14]) but not procedural fear (n=17; SMD: 0.18 [-0.87, 1.23]). Applied tension showed benefit on fainting posttreatment (n=20; SMD: -1.16 [-2.12, -0.19]) and after 1 year (n=20; SMD: -0.97 [-1.91, -0.03]) compared with exposure alone. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure-based psychological interventions and applied muscle tension show evidence of benefit in the reduction of fear in pediatric and adult populations.

    this systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of exposure-based psychological and physical interventions for the management of high levels of needle fear and/or phobia and fainting in children and adults. design/methods: a systematic review identified relevant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of children, adults, or both with high levels of needle fear, including phobia (if not available, then populations with other specific phobias were included). critically important outcomes were self-reported fear specific to the feared situation and stimulus (psychological interventions) or fainting (applied muscle tension). data were pooled using standardized mean difference (smd) or relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. results: the systematic review included 11 trials. in vivo exposure-based therapy for children 7 years and above showed benefit on specific fear (n=234; smd: -1.71 [95% ci: -2.72, -0.7]). in vivo exposure-based therapy with adults reduced fear of needles posttreatment (n=20; smd: -1.09 [-2.04, -0.14]) but not at 1-year follow-up (n=20; smd: -0.28 [-1.16, 0.6]). compared with single session, a benefit was observed for multiple sessions of exposure-based therapy posttreatment (n=93; smd: -0.66 [-1.08, -0.24]) but not after 1 year (n=83; smd: -0.37 [-0.87, 0.13]). non in vivo e.g., imaginal exposure-based therapy in children reduced specific fear posttreatment (n=41; smd: -0.88 [-1.7, -0.05]) and at 3 months (n=24; smd: -0.89 [-1.73, -0.04]). non in vivo exposure-based therapy for adults showed benefit on specific fear (n=68; smd: -0.62 [-1.11, -0.14]) but not procedural fear (n=17; smd: 0.18 [-0.87, 1.23]). applied tension showed benefit on fainting posttreatment (n=20; smd: -1.16 [-2.12, -0.19]) and after 1 year (n=20; smd: -0.97 [-1.91, -0.03]) compared with exposure alone. conclusions: exposure-based psychological interventions and applied muscle tension show evidence of benefit in the reduction of fear in pediatric and adult populations.

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in patients with TTH. METHOD: We performed a systematic review according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Randomised trials reporting conservative treatments in patients with TTH with headache as outcome were included. In the analysis studies were grouped according to type of intervention: acute pain medication, preventive medication, physiotherapy interventions, behavioural interventions and interventions in children. RESULTS: A total of 152 trials were included in this review with 17.523 patients, of which 37 studies (24.3%) were considered to be of high quality. Nine studies could not be included in one of the five subgroups. ACUTE MEDICATION: (41 trials). The pooled analyses showed that NSAIDs and acetaminophen are more effective than placebo. No significant differences could be found between different types of NSAIDs, but ibuprofen showed fewer short-term side effects when compared to other NSAIDs. There was a significant difference in favour of NSAIDs when compared to acetaminophen. PREVENTIVE MEDICATION: (44 trials). Overall, the use of antidepressants does not show to be more effective than placebo, and no significant differences between different types of antidepressants were found. Furthermore there is limited evidence concerning the negative effects of propranolol on depression in TTH patients, when compared to placebo or biofeedback. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and vasodilator agents compared to placebo. There is no evidence concerning the effectiveness of muscle relaxants compared to placebo. BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY: (44 trials). Eight studies compared relaxation treatment with a waiting list or attention placebo control, and 11 studies compared EMG biofeedback with placebo and in both interventions we found inconsistent results. Most trials lack adequate power to show statistical significant differences, but frequently recovery/improvement rates did not reach clinical relevance. PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS: (12 trials). A wide variety of interventions were evaluated, such as spinal manipulations, exercise and physical applications. Overall the studies showed inconsistent results. CHILDREN: (11 trials). Eight studies evaluated the effectiveness of relaxation training. We found conflicting evidence for relaxation therapy compared with no treatment or other treatments. CONCLUSION: The evidence in this review suggests that NSAIDs and acetaminophen are both effective for short-term pain relief in patients with TTH. No specific type of NSAID was clearly more effective than others, but ibuprofen showed fewer side effects. There is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the effectiveness of preventive medication, physiotherapy, (spinal) manipulation, EMG biofeedback or cognitive behavioural treatment in patients with TTH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |      2010      |       nan       |         Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd          |  154   |   nan    |   A1924   |       nan        |               nan                | 20699021.0 |    #3791    |     Verhagen 2010      |  nan  | nan  |                                 [Treatment of tension type headache: paracetamol and NSAIDs work: a systematic review].                                  |                                                                             VerhagenArianne PAPErasmus MC, Afd.

headache. our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in patients with tth. method: we performed a systematic review according to the guidelines of the cochrane collaboration. randomised trials reporting conservative treatments in patients with tth with headache as outcome were included. in the analysis studies were grouped according to type of intervention: acute pain medication, preventive medication, physiotherapy interventions, behavioural interventions and interventions in children. results: a total of 152 trials were included in this review with 17.523 patients, of which 37 studies (24.3%) were considered to be of high quality. nine studies could not be included in one of the five subgroups. acute medication: (41 trials). the pooled analyses showed that nsaids and acetaminophen are more effective than placebo. no significant differences could be found between different types of nsaids, but ibuprofen showed fewer short-term side effects when compared to other nsaids. there was a significant difference in favour of nsaids when compared to acetaminophen. preventive medication: (44 trials). overall, the use of antidepressants does not show to be more effective than placebo, and no significant differences between different types of antidepressants were found. furthermore there is limited evidence concerning the negative effects of propranolol on depression in tth patients, when compared to placebo or biofeedback. there is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and vasodilator agents compared to placebo. there is no evidence concerning the effectiveness of muscle relaxants compared to placebo. behavioural therapy: (44 trials). eight studies compared relaxation treatment with a waiting list or attention placebo control, and 11 studies compared emg biofeedback with placebo and in both interventions we found inconsistent results. most trials lack adequate power to show statistical significant differences, but frequently recovery/improvement rates did not reach clinical relevance. physiotherapeutic interventions: (12 trials). a wide variety of interventions were evaluated, such as spinal manipulations, exercise and physical applications. overall the studies showed inconsistent results. children: (11 trials). eight studies evaluated the effectiveness of relaxation training. we found conflicting evidence for relaxation therapy compared with no treatment or other treatments. conclusion: the evidence in this review suggests that nsaids and acetaminophen are both effective for short-term pain relief in patients with tth. no specific type of nsaid was clearly more effective than others, but ibuprofen showed fewer side effects. there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the effectiveness of preventive medication, physiotherapy, (spinal) manipulation, emg biofeedback or cognitive behavioural treatment in patients with tth.

Primary attention was paid to the effects of wind and stringed instruments. The aim of the article was the presentation of research and opinions about this problem in the last 25 years. It is reported that long-term and repetitive playing of musical instruments, particularly stringed (violin and viola) and wind instruments can cause dysfunctions of the stomatognathic system. The impact of wind instruments was assessed in terms of the type of mouthpiece. We studied the possibility of repositioning the front teeth and reducing the width of the upper dental arch and overbite. There were also reports on the use of a specific instrument to improve the child's occlusion. Studies have also been performed on the usefulness of relaxation plates in order to improve, and even prevent, dysfunction caused by the constant stress on the same parts of the stomatognathic system. The experiments were mainly based on interviews, dental cast analyses and cephalometric analyses.

Primary attention was paid to the effects of wind and stringed instruments. The aim of the article was the presentation of research and opinions about this problem in the last 25 years. It is reported that long-term and repetitive playing of musical instruments, particularly stringed (violin and viola) and wind instruments can cause dysfunctions of the stomatognathic system. The impact of wind instruments was assessed in terms of the type of mouthpiece. We studied the possibility of repositioning the front teeth and reducing the width of the upper dental arch and overbite. There were also reports on the use of a specific instrument to improve the child's occlusion.

Low back pain results in high health costs and incapacity to work causing an economic burden to society. The optimal management of non-specific low back pain appears to be undecided. Recently published guidelines support the use of acupuncture for treating non-specific low back pain and it has become a popular alternative treatment modality for patients with low back pain. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted through Medline using Ovid and Medical Subject Headings for randomized controlled trials published in the last 10 years. The outcomes scored were subjective pain scores and functional outcome scores. RESULTS: Eighty two randomized studies were identified, of which 7 met our inclusion criteria. Three studies found a significant difference in pain scores when comparing acupuncture, or sham acupuncture, with conventional therapy or no care. Two studies demonstrated a significant difference between acupuncture treatment and no treatment or routine care at 8 weeks and 3 months. Three studies demonstrated no significant difference between acupuncture and minimal/sham acupuncture with no difference in pain relief or function over 6 to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides some evidence to support acupuncture as more effective than no treatment, but no conclusions can be drawn about its effectiveness over other treatment modalities as the evidence is conflicting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |      2012      |       Oct       |           J Orthop Surg Res            |   7    |   nan    |    36     |       nan        |      10.1186/1749-799X-7-36      | 23111099.0 |    #3823    |    Hutchinson 2012     |  nan  | nan  |                 The effectiveness of acupuncture in treating chronic non-specific low back pain: a systematic review of the literature.                  |                                      HutchinsonAmanda J PAJDepartment of Physiotherapy, Trauma & Orthopaedics, Charing-Cross Hospital, Imperial College NHS Trust, Fulham Palace Road, London, W6 8RF, UK. ajphutch@hotmail.com                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder defined as pain and soreness, muscle tension, or stiffness in the lumbosacral area of the spine which does not have a specific cause. Low back pain results in high health costs and incapacity to work causing an economic burden to society. The optimal management of non-specific low back pain appears to be undecided. Recently published guidelines support the use of acupuncture for treating non-specific low back pain and it has become a popular alternative treatment modality for patients with low back pain.

The evidence clarifying autonomic responses specific to painful stimulation, however, has been rather sporadic and lacks coherence; thus, a summary and critical review is needed in this area. OBJECTIVES: To summarize and integrate findings from 39 experimental investigations from 1970 to 2012 of pain-induced autonomic arousal in humans. METHODS: Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant articles. References from these articles were also considered for review. RESULTS: Painful stimuli increase respiration rate, induce muscle tension, intensify electrodermal activity and dilate the pupils. Cardiovascular activity also increases, but the pattern displayed in response to pain is complex; peripheral vasoconstriction and sympathetically mediated cardiac responses are most typical. Additionally, autonomic expression of pain shows inconsistent relations with verbal and overt motor responses. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic arousal can be legitimately measured and modified as one facet of the pain response. Future research should particularly focus on increasing sample size and broadening the diversity of participants. To improve the ability to compare and contrast findings across studies, as well as to increase the applicability of laboratory findings to naturalistic pain, investigators also must enhance experimental design by increasing uniformity or accounting for differences in methodology. Finally, further work remains to utilize more specific assessments of autonomic response and to assess relationships of autonomic reactivity with other cognitive (e.g., attention) and affective (e.g., anxiety) variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |      2014      |     May-Jun     |             Pain Res Manag             |   19   |    3     |  159-67   |       nan        |       10.1155/2014/536859        | 24533429.0 |    #3852    |       Kyle 2014        |  nan  | nan  |                                 Autonomic arousal and experimentally induced pain: a critical review of the literature.                                  |                                                                                                                        KyleBrandon NicholasBN                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Autonomic arousal frequently is assumed to be a component of the pain response, perhaps because physiological mechanisms connecting pain and autonomic reactivity can be easily conceptualized.

thus, a summary and critical review is needed in this area. to summarize and integrate findings from 39 experimental investigations from 1970 to 2012 of pain-induced autonomic arousal in humans. methods: medline and psycinfo databases were searched for relevant articles. references from these articles were also considered for review. results: painful stimuli increase respiration rate, induce muscle tension, intensify electrodermal activity and dilate the pupils. cardiovascular activity also increases, but the pattern displayed in response to pain is complex; peripheral vasoconstriction and sympathetically mediated cardiac responses are most typical. additionally, autonomic expression of pain shows inconsistent relations with verbal and overt motor responses. conclusions: autonomic arousal can be legitimately measured and modified as one facet of the pain response. future research should particularly focus on increasing sample size and broadening the diversity of participants. to improve the ability to compare and contrast findings across studies, as well as to increase the applicability of laboratory findings to naturalistic pain, investigators also must enhance experimental design by increasing uniformity or accounting for differences in methodology. finally, further work remains to utilize more specific assessments of autonomic response and to assess relationships of autonomic reactivity with other cognitive (e.g., attention) and affective (e.g., anxiety) variables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |        1        |\n",

METHODS: Three databases, OVID, PubMed, and EMBASE, were used to collect articles. The search terms used were \"cerebrovascular accident (CVA),\" \"stroke\", and \"virtual reality\". Consequently, twenty-one studies were selected in the second screening of meta-analyses. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: The total effect size for VR rehabilitation programs was 0.440. The effect size for upper limb function was 0.431, for lower limb function it was 0.424, and for overall function it was 0.545. The effects of VR programs on specific outcomes were most effective for improving muscle tension, followed by muscle strength, activities of daily living (ADL), joint range of motion, gait, balance, and kinematics. CONCLUSION: The VR training was effective in improving the function in chronic stroke patients, corresponding to a moderate effect size.

screening of meta-analyses. the pedro scale was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. results: the total effect size for vr rehabilitation programs was 0.440. the effect size for upper limb function was 0.431, for lower limb function it was 0.424, and for overall function it was 0.545. the effects of vr programs on specific outcomes were most effective for improving muscle tension, followed by muscle strength, activities of daily living (adl), joint range of motion, gait, balance, and kinematics. conclusion: the vr training was effective in improving the function in chronic stroke patients, corresponding to a moderate effect size. moreover, vr training showed a similar effect for improving lower limb function as it did for upper limb function.

PURPOSE: The purpose of the current review is to present and summarize data about isokinetic trunk strength assessment relative to young, adolescent and adult athletes. Testing position variations, reliability values by age groups, utilization of strength measures and normative data by age groups have been discussed. The information presented within this review are of practical importance for assessment of isokinetic trunk strength to appraise the athlete's current strength level and provide suitable conditioning training program. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: NCBI-PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus were searched to identify relevant correlation and intervention studies/trials related to isokinetic testing of the trunk. Forty-two studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this literature review. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The validity of isokinetic trunk measures (i.e. peak torque; flexion/extension ratios) can be affected by a number of factors including whether the individual is tested in seated or standing position, which can alter the muscle length-tension relationship. Reliability is excellent for some strength measures and moderate to high for muscle endurance. Extension and concentric measures tend to have better reliability than flexion and eccentric measures respectively, while females show typically higher reliability scores than men due to the difficulty in controlling men's body position when testing. Normative data for various populations are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle assessment methods using an isokinetic dynamometer are considered reliable with high correlations to peak strength values and flexor/extensor ratios over age groups. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting position-specific isokinetic test results that measure trunk flexion (standing vs seated position). Still, there are indications that low-velocity movements are more reliable for measuring trunk strength. In adolescence, boys appear stronger than girls, with higher values for trunk extensors. Trunk flexors and extensors ratios decrease with growth. Data of isokinetic trunk muscle performance seems to be correlated not only to anthropometric parameters but also to sports discipline and training volume. The effects of sport on the muscular strength of the trunk may have both a preventive factor and a possible risk factor for low back pain. There is evidence for an association between high physical workloads and back injury.

of the current review is to present and summarize data about isokinetic trunk strength assessment relative to young, adolescent and adult athletes. testing position variations, reliability values by age groups, utilization of strength measures and normative data by age groups have been discussed. the information presented within this review are of practical importance for assessment of isokinetic trunk strength to appraise the athlete's current strength level and provide suitable conditioning training program. study design: literature review. methods: ncbi-pubmed, web of science, and sportdiscus were searched to identify relevant correlation and intervention studies/trials related to isokinetic testing of the trunk. forty-two studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this literature review. evidence synthesis: the validity of isokinetic trunk measures (i.e. peak torque; flexion/extension ratios) can be affected by a number of factors including whether the individual is tested in seated or standing position, which can alter the muscle length-tension relationship. reliability is excellent for some strength measures and moderate to high for muscle endurance. extension and concentric measures tend to have better reliability than flexion and eccentric measures respectively, while females show typically higher reliability scores than men due to the difficulty in controlling men's body position when testing. normative data for various populations are provided. conclusions: muscle assessment methods using an isokinetic dynamometer are considered reliable with high correlations to peak strength values and flexor/extensor ratios over age groups. however, caution should be exercised when interpreting position-specific isokinetic test results that measure trunk flexion (standing vs seated position). still, there are indications that low-velocity movements are more reliable for measuring trunk strength. in adolescence, boys appear stronger than girls, with higher values for trunk extensors. trunk flexors and extensors ratios decrease with growth. data of isokinetic trunk muscle performance seems to be correlated not only to anthropometric parameters but also to sports discipline and training volume. the effects of sport on the muscular strength of the trunk may have both a preventive factor and a possible risk factor for low back pain. there is evidence for an association between high physical workloads and back injury. level of evidence: 5.

In addition, their confused and stereotyped behaviours may change their responses to pain; the indicators and descriptors generally used to evaluate pain in the critically ill may therefore not be appropriate for brain-injured patients. AIM: The aim of this integrative review was to identify clinically measurable and observable pain indicators and descriptors for brain-injured, critically ill adults. METHOD: A search of electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Embase) combined with cross-referencing was performed. Articles were included if they described pain indicators in critically ill adults and included brain-injured patients in their population. RESULTS: Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. They were critically appraised for their quality and their relevance for the population of brain-injured patients. Behavioural pain indicators such as facial expressions, body movements and muscle tension were found in all of the articles. However, the descriptions of the indicators differ from one article to another. The intensity and nature of behavioural pain responses vary according to the level of consciousness. Changes in physiological parameters have also been reported, but these results are inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Additional research is needed to identify and better describe pain indicators that are specific to brain-injured patients in the ICU. Studies with large samples, different brain injury diagnoses and various levels of consciousness are warranted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |      2012      |       May       |             Aust Crit Care             |   25   |    2     |   110-8   |       nan        |    10.1016/j.aucc.2011.10.002    | 22104632.0 |    #3953    |      Roulin 2012       |  nan  | nan  |                                      Pain indicators in brain-injured critical care adults: an integrative review.                                       |                                    RoulinMarie-JosÃ©MJInstitute of Higher Education and Nursing Research, Lausanne University - CHUV, Avenue CÃ©sar-Roux 19 - 2(e) Ã©tage, 1005 Lausanne, Switzerland. marie-jose.roulin@hcuge.ch                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Health professionals are confronted with the difficulty of adequately evaluating pain in critically ill, brain-injured patients, as these patients are often unable to self-report.

Sympathetic innervation of the proximal esophagus is derived primarily from cervical and upper thoracic paravertebral ganglia, whereas that of the lower esophageal sphincter and proximal stomach is derived from the celiac ganglion. In addition to noradrenaline, many sympathetic fibers in the esophagus contain neuropeptide Y (NPY), and both noradrenaline and NPY appear to decrease blood flow and motility. Preganglionic neurons innervating the cervical and upper thoracic ganglia are located at lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal levels. The preganglionic innervation of the celiac ganglion arises from lower thoracic spinal levels. Both acetylcholine (ACh) and enkephalin (ENK) have been localized in sympathetic preganglionic neurons, and it has been suggested that ENK acts to pre-synaptically inhibit ganglionic transmission. Spinal afferents from the esophagus are few, but have been described in lower cervical and thoracic dorsal root ganglia. A significant percentage contain calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). The central distribution of spinal afferents, as well as their subsequent processing within the spinal cord, have not been addressed. Medullary afferents arise from the nodose ganglion and terminate peripherally both in myenteric ganglia, where they have been postulated to act as tension receptors, and, to a lesser extent, in more superficial layers. Centrally, these afferents appear to end in a discrete part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) termed the central subnucleus. The transmitter specificity of the majority of these afferents remains unknown. The central subnucleus, in turn, sends a dense and topographically discrete projection to esophageal motor neurons in the rostral portion of the nucleus ambiguous (NA). Both somatostatin-(SS) and ENK-related peptides have been localized in this pathway. Finally, motor neurons from the rostral NA innervate striated portions of the esophagus.

Sympathetic innervation of the proximal esophagus is derived primarily from cervical and upper thoracic paravertebral ganglia, whereas that of the lower esophageal sphincter and proximal stomach is derived from the celiac ganglion. In addition to noradrenaline, many sympathetic fibers in the esophagus contain neuropeptide Y (NPY), and both noradrenaline and NPY appear to decrease blood flow and motility. Preganglionic neurons innervating the cervical and upper thoracic ganglia are located at lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal levels. The preganglionic innervation of the celiac ganglion arises from lower thoracic spinal levels. Both acetylcholine (ACh) and enkephalin (ENK) have been localized in sympathetic preganglionic neurons, and it has been suggested that ENK acts to pre-synaptically inhibit ganglionic transmission. Spinal afferents from the esophagus are few, but have been described in lower cervical and thoracic dorsal root ganglia. A significant percentage contain calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). The central distribution of spinal afferents, as well as their subsequent processing within the spinal cord, have not been addressed. Medullary afferents arise from the nodose ganglion and terminate peripherally both in myenteric ganglia, where they have been postulated to act as tension receptors, and, to a lesser extent, in more superficial layers. Centrally, these afferents appear to end in a discrete part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) termed the central subnucleus. The transmitter specificity of the majority of these afferents remains unknown. The central subnucleus, in turn, sends a dense and topographically discrete projection to esophageal motor neurons in the rostral portion of the nucleus ambiguous (NA). Both somatostatin-(SS) and ENK-related peptides have been localized in this pathway. Finally, motor neurons from the rostral NA innervate striated portions of the esophagus. In addition to ACh, these esophageal motor neurons contain CGRP, galanin (GAL), N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).

Some complications include skin changes, edema, heavy legs, muscle cramps, pain, and varicose veins. In traditional medicine, red vine leaf extract (AS 195) has been used to cure the symptoms of CVI. This systematic review was aimed to assess the effects of AS 195 in patients with CVI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify trials that reported the impact of red vine leaf extract on CVI. The primary outcomes investigated were Leg (limb) volume, calf circumference, ankle circumference, tired and heavy legs, a sensation of tension, tingling sensation, and pain. RESULTS: From the 56 studies, 5 trials were selected according to our inclusion criteria. Red vine leaf extract significantly improved numbers of outcomes (lower leg volume, calf and ankle circumference, tired, heavy legs, tingling sensation, pain, the sensation of tension in the legs, cutaneous microcirculation, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure) in only some trials. The tolerability for red vine leaf extract was reported good or satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: Red vine leaf extract had a beneficial therapeutic role in patients with CVI.

primary outcomes investigated were leg (limb) volume, calf circumference, ankle circumference, tired and heavy legs, a sensation of tension, tingling sensation, and pain. results: from the 56 studies, 5 trials were selected according to our inclusion criteria. red vine leaf extract significantly improved numbers of outcomes (lower leg volume, calf and ankle circumference, tired, heavy legs, tingling sensation, pain, the sensation of tension in the legs, cutaneous microcirculation, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure) in only some trials. the tolerability for red vine leaf extract was reported good or satisfactory. conclusions: red vine leaf extract had a beneficial therapeutic role in patients with cvi. further high-quality trials are required to be carried out to provide strong

            "|       In vivo oxygen, temperature and pH dynamics in the female reproductive tract and their importance in human conception: a systematic review.        |                                         Ng KYB; Mingels R; Morgan H; Macklon N; Cheong Y                                         | BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ART, implantation and pregnancy rates per embryo transfer still remain low. IVF laboratories strive to ensure that the process of handling gametes in vitro closely mimics the in vivo environment. However, there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the in vivo regulation and dynamic variation in biophysical parameters such as oxygen concentration, pH and temperature within the reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: To undertake a systematic review of the current understanding of the physico-chemical parameters of oxygen tension (pO2), pH and temperature within the female reproductive tract, and their potential implications in clinical and pathological processes related to fertility and those pertaining to limited reproductive capacity. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Pubmed to identify original and review articles addressing the biophysical parameters (pO2, pH and temperature) in the female reproductive tract of any species. The search included all studies published between 1946 and November 2015. Search terms included 'oxygen', 'pH', 'hydrogen ion concentration', 'acid base' and others terms. We also used special features and truncations to identify synonyms and broaden the search. Studies were excluded if they only assessed embryo culture conditions, fetal acid-base status, oxidative stress, outcomes of pregnancy and measurements of these parameters in non-reproductive organs. OUTCOMES: Our search generated 18 685 records and 60 articles were included. pO2 within the female reproductive tract shows cyclical variation and minute-to-minute oscillations, which may be influenced by uterine contractility, hormones, the autonomic system, cardiac pulsatility, and myometrial and smooth muscle integrity. Fine balanced control of pO2 and avoidance of overwhelming oxidative stress is crucial for embryogenesis and implantation. The pH in the female reproductive tract is graduated, with lowest pH in the vagina (~pH 4.42) increasing toward the Fallopian tubes (FTs) (~pH 7.94), reflecting variation in the site-specific microbiome and acid-base buffering at the tissue/cellular level. The temperature variation in humans is cyclical by day and month. In humans, it is biphasic, increasing in the luteal phase; with the caudal region of the oviduct 1-2 degrees cooler than the cranial portion. Temperature variation is influenced by hormones, density of pelvic/uterine vascular beds and effectiveness of heat exchange locally, crucial for sperm motility and embryo development. We have identified significant deficiencies and inconsistencies in the methods used to assess these biophysical factors within the reproductive tract. We have suggested that the technological solutions including the development of methods and models for real time, in vivo recordings of biophysical parameters. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The notion of 'back to nature' in assisted conception suggested 20 years ago has yet to be translated into clinical practice. While the findings from this systematic review do not provide evidence to change current in vitro protocols, it highlights our current inability to assess the in vivo reproductive tract environment in real time. Data made available through future development of sensing technology in utero may help to provide new insights into how best to optimize the in vitro embryo environment and allow for more precise and personalized fertility treatment. |      2018      |       Jan       |           Hum Reprod Update            |   24   |    1     |   15-34   |       nan        |      10.1093/humupd/dmx028       | 29077897.0 |    #3976    |       NgKYB 2018       |  nan  | nan  |       In vivo oxygen, temperature and pH dynamics in the female reproductive tract and their importance in human conception: a systematic review.        | NgKa Ying BonnieKYBHuman Development and Health Academic Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Princess Anne Hospital, Room F86, Level F, Coxford Road, Southampton SO16 5YA, UK. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Despite advances in ART, implantation and pregnancy rates per embryo transfer still remain low.

with the caudal region of the oviduct 1-2 degrees cooler than the cranial portion. temperature variation is influenced by hormones, density of pelvic/uterine vascular beds and effectiveness of heat exchange locally, crucial for sperm motility and embryo development. we have identified significant deficiencies and inconsistencies in the methods used to assess these biophysical factors within the reproductive tract. we have suggested that the technological solutions including the development of methods and models for real time, in vivo recordings of biophysical parameters. wider implications: the notion of 'back to nature' in assisted conception suggested 20 years ago has yet to be translated into clinical practice. while the findings from this systematic review do not provide evidence to change current in vitro protocols, it highlights our current inability to assess the in vivo reproductive tract environment in real time. data made available through future development of sensing technology in utero may help to provide new insights into how best to optimize the in vitro embryo environment and allow for more precise and personalized fertility treatment. |        1        |\n",

Biofeedback is one of the approaches used in connected mental health solutions, which is mainly based on the analysis of physiological indicators for the assessment and management of the psychological state. Biofeedback is recommended by many therapists and has been used for conditions including depression, insomnia, and anxiety. Anxiety is associated with several physiological symptoms, including muscle tension and breathing issues, which makes the inclusion of biofeedback useful for anxiety detection and management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify interventions using biofeedback as a part of their process for anxiety management and investigate their perceived effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic literature review of publications presenting empirically evaluated biofeedback-based interventions for anxiety was conducted. The systematic literature review was based on publications retrieved from IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. A preliminary selection of papers was identified, examined, and filtered to include only relevant publications. Studies in the final selection were classified and analyzed to extract the modalities of use of biofeedback in the identified interventions, the types of physiological data that were collected and analyzed and the sensors used to collect them. Processes and outcomes of the empirical evaluations were also extracted. RESULTS: After final selection, 13 publications presenting different interventions were investigated. The interventions addressed either primarily anxiety disorders or anxiety associated with health issues such as migraine, Parkinson disease, and rheumatology. Solutions combined biofeedback with other techniques including virtual reality, music therapy, games, and relaxation practices and used different sensors including cardiovascular belts, wrist sensors, or stretch sensors to collect physiological data such as heart rate, respiration indicators, and movement information. The interventions targeted different cohorts including children, students, and patients. Overall, outcomes from the empirical evaluations yielded positive results and emphasized the effectiveness of connected mental health solutions using biofeedback for anxiety; however, certain unfavorable outcomes, such as interventions not having an effect on anxiety and patients' preferring traditional therapy, were reported in studies addressing patients with specific physical health issues. CONCLUSIONS: The use of biofeedback in connected mental health interventions for the treatment and management of anxiety allows better screening and understanding of both psychological and physiological patient information, as well as of the association between the two. The inclusion of biofeedback could improve the outcome of interventions and boost their effectiveness; however, when used with patients suffering from certain physical health issues, suitability investigations are needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |      2021      |       Apr       |          JMIR Mhealth Uhealth          |   9    |    4     |  e26038   |       nan        |          10.2196/26038           | 33792548.0 |    #3997    |     Alneyadi 2021      |  nan  | nan  |                            Biofeedback-Based Connected Mental Health Interventions for Anxiety: Systematic Literature Review.                            |                                                 AlneyadiMahraM0000-0002-2565-8648Department of Computer Science & Software Engineering, College of Information Technology, Al Ain, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Connected mental health, which refers to the use of technology for mental health care and technology-based therapeutic solutions, has become an established field of research.

Anxiety is associated with several physiological symptoms, including muscle tension and breathing issues, which makes the inclusion of biofeedback useful for anxiety detection and management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                      JMIR mHealth and uHealth                                                       |    9    |    4     |   e26038e26038    | 2021.0 |          anxiety           |    irrelevant    |                                                                                                                                                                                                         connected mental health, which refers to the use of technology for mental health care and technology-based therapeutic solutions, has become an established field of research. biofeedback is one of the approaches used in connected mental health solutions, which is mainly based on the analysis of physiological indicators for the assessment and management of the psychological state. biofeedback is recommended by many therapists and has been used for conditions including depression, insomnia, and anxiety. anxiety is associated with several physiological symptoms, including muscle tension and breathing issues, which makes the inclusion of biofeedback useful for anxiety detection and management. the aim of this study was to identify interventions using biofeedback as a part of their process for anxiety management and investigate their perceived effectiveness. methods: a systematic literature review of publications presenting empirically evaluated biofeedback-based interventions for anxiety was conducted. the systematic literature review was based on publications retrieved from ieee digital library, pubmed, sciencedirect, and scopus. a preliminary selection of papers was identified, examined, and filtered to include only relevant publications. studies in the final selection were classified and analyzed to extract the modalities of use of biofeedback in the identified interventions, the types of physiological data that were collected and analyzed and the sensors used to collect them. processes and outcomes of the empirical evaluations were also extracted. results: after final selection, 13 publications presenting different interventions were investigated. the interventions addressed either primarily anxiety disorders or anxiety associated with health issues such as migraine, parkinson disease, and rheumatology. solutions combined biofeedback with other techniques including virtual reality, music therapy, games, and relaxation practices and used different sensors including cardiovascular belts, wrist sensors, or stretch sensors to collect physiological data such as heart rate, respiration indicators, and movement information. the interventions targeted different cohorts including children, students, and patients. overall, outcomes from the empirical evaluations yielded positive results and emphasized the effectiveness of connected mental health solutions using biofeedback for anxiety; however, certain unfavorable outcomes, such as interventions not having an effect on anxiety and patients' preferring traditional therapy, were reported in studies addressing patients with specific physical health issues. conclusions: the use of biofeedback in connected mental health interventions for the treatment and management of anxiety allows better screening and understanding of both psychological and physiological patient information, as well as of the association between the two. the inclusion of biofeedback could improve the outcome of interventions and boost their effectiveness; however, when used with patients suffering from certain physical health issues, suitability investigations are needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |        1        |\n",

Whereas the y-axis will be populated by the c-TF-IDF scores. The result is a visualization that shows you the decline of c-TF-IDF score when adding words to the topic representation.

Measurement of torque: The torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems Inc., Shirley, NY) at an angular velocity of 60Â°/s. The participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for each leg, with a 30-second rest between each contraction. The highest torque value was recorded for each leg._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                           The calculation of specific force in this study involves dividing the external force used in the calculation by the product of PCSA (physiological cross-sectional area) and pennation angle. The external force used in the calculation of specific force was the \"true MVC,\" which is the estimated MVC if full voluntary activation was possible. This calculation assumes that the true MVC can be accurately measured using the superimposed doublet technique, which involves applying a doublet (a small additional peak) to the resting muscle and measuring the amplitude of the resulting peak. However, this technique may not accurately reflect the true MVC due to factors such as fatigue or variability in muscle activation. Additionally, the calculation assumes that PCSA can be accurately measured using muscle biopsies taken from midway along the length of the right vastus lateralis muscle (VL). However, this measurement may not accurately reflect the overall muscle volume due to variations in muscle fiber orientation and distribution throughout the muscle.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

Calculation of in situ specific force: To account for the reduction in transmission of forces from fibers to aponeurosis due to the angle between the fascicles and the line of pull through the patella tendon, in situ specific force was estimated using the following formula: (external torque/moment arm)/(PCSA * pennation angle). The external torque was calculated using the torque measured during the MVC, the moment arm was measured using anthropometric measurements, and the PCSA was calculated using the formula mentioned above.

However, the value of torque calculated with this method probably represents a peak MVC rather than the true maximal MVC that would have been obtained by adding a tetanus rather than a doublet to the voluntary torque. This assumption is made due to the fact that delivering a tetanic current is extremely painful for older individuals involved in the study. Therefore, the calculation of specific tension in this study may have some weakness in terms of accurately measuring muscle force or volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

The weakness in calculating specific tension may lie in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume. For example, in measuring muscle force, the study may assume that the force recorded during maximal voluntary isometric contraction accurately represents the force generated by the muscle. However, this may not always be the case due to factors such as muscle fatigue or variability in muscle activation levels. In measuring muscle volume or cross-sectional area (CSA), the study may assume that the MRI images accurately represent the true size of the muscle. However, this may also be affected by factors such as muscle hydration levels or the quality of the MRI images themselves. These assumptions may affect the accuracy of the specific tension calculations, which could impact the results of the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The weakness in calculating specific tension may lie in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume. For example, in measuring muscle force, the study may assume that the force recorded during maximal voluntary isometric contraction accurately represents the force generated by the muscle. However, this may not always be the case due to factors such as muscle fatigue or variability in muscle activation levels. In measuring muscle volume or cross-sectional area (CSA), the study may assume that the MRI images accurately represent the true size of the muscle. However, this may also be affected by factors such as muscle hydration levels or the quality of the MRI images themselves. These assumptions may affect the accuracy of the specific tension calculations, which could impact the results of the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The weakness in calculating specific tension may lie in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume. For example, in measuring muscle force, the study may assume that the force recorded during maximal voluntary isometric contraction accurately represents the force generated by the muscle. However, this may not always be the case due to factors such as muscle fatigue or variability in muscle activation levels. In measuring muscle volume or cross-sectional area (CSA), the study may assume that the MRI images accurately represent the true size of the muscle. However, this may also be affected by factors such as muscle hydration levels or the quality of the MRI images themselves. These assumptions may affect the accuracy of the specific tension calculations, which could impact the results of the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

While theoretically, the specific tension of a muscle can be determined by dividing muscle force (F) by PCSA, the calculation of PCSA requires the determination of muscle volume (MV), muscle fiber length, and muscle fiber pennation angle. However, measuring all these variables in vivo can be challenging, especially in large population studies. Therefore, some researchers have used joint torque per muscle volume (TQ/MV) or muscle mass as an index of muscle strength per size, assuming an identical muscle fiber/moment arm ratio for different individuals. However, it is unclear whether TQ/MV is a substitute for specific tension in elderly individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Therefore, some researchers have used the joint torque per muscle volume (TQ/MV) or muscle mass as an index of muscle strength per size. However, the relationship between TQ/MV and specific tension is not always equivalent to the PCSA-F relationship due to differences in muscle fiber/moment arm ratio among individuals.                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

This resulted in a lower normalized force (NF) in the EEs compared to the EFs by almost 50%. Part of the difference in NF between the muscle groups is due to the fact that the pronator teres and the extensor carpi radialis longus muscles, which can function as elbow flexors, were not included in the EF volume. Consequently, NF of the EFs was likely overestimated by 15% in the present study (38). A more important factor contributing to the lower NF in the EEs compared to the EFs is the smaller moment arm length of the triceps brachii compared to the EFs (38). Therefore, the study highlights that assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume can affect the calculation of specific tension. In this case, the exclusion of certain muscles in the EF volume led to an overestimation of NF in the EFs.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

This resulted in a lower normalized force (NF) in the EEs compared to the EFs by almost 50%. Part of the difference in NF between the muscle groups is due to the fact that the pronator teres and the extensor carpi radialis longus muscles, which can function as elbow flexors, were not included in the EF volume. Consequently, NF of the EFs was likely overestimated by 15% in the present study (38). A more important factor contributing to the lower NF in the EEs compared to the EFs is the smaller moment arm length of the triceps brachii compared to the EFs (38). Therefore, the study highlights that assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume can affect the calculation of specific tension. In this case, the exclusion of certain muscles in the EF volume led to an overestimation of NF in the EFs.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n",

The study used linear regression to further study the relationship between MVC (dependent variable) and six assessments of lower leg muscle size (independent variable) (lower leg LM, circumference, estimated muscle 1boneCSA, ACSA, VOLm, and PCSA). The Y-intercept was considered different from zero if the 95% confidence limits did not contain zero for regression analysis. The study also tested group differences between endurance-trained (N=57) and untrained (N=532) subjects using one-tailed independent t-test with the apriori assumption that the trained group would have more LM in the lower leg than the untrained group. Significance for all tests was accepted at a P,0.05 level of confidence. Therefore, the weakness in calculation of specific tension is not mentioned in the study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

Measurement of torque: The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm, Stoughton, MA) at an angular velocity of 60Â° sâˆ’1. The MVC torque was recorded for each leg at the knee joint angle that produced the highest torque (optimum knee joint angle)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The study did not mention any weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension in terms of assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The study reported that an increase in human muscle specific tension appears to be a real consequence of resistance training rather than being an artefact of measuring errors. However, the underlying cause of this phenomenon remains to be determined. The study did not provide specific details on the methods used to measure muscle force or volume, but it did mention that the maximum force generated by skeletal muscle is primarily determined by the number of sarcomeres arranged in parallel, which is represented by the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Measurement of force: Maximum patellar tendon force was measured using a force transducer (Kistler, Amherst, NY) attached to the patellar tendon via a custom-made strap. The force transducer was connected to an amplifier (Kistler, Amherst, NY) and then to a computer (Dell, Round Rock, TX) for data collection and analysis using a custom-made software program (LabView, National Instruments, Austin, TX). The maximum patellar tendon force was recorded for each leg during the MVC at the optimum knee joint angle._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

Measurement of muscle volume: The volume of each QF muscle was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (GE Signa Excite HDxt 3.0T, Milwaukee, WI) at baseline and post-training. The MRI images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of each muscle at three different levels (distal, mid-belly, and proximal) (Chow et al., 1999). The CSA of each muscle at each level was multiplied by the length of the muscle (Lf) between the measurement sites to calculate the muscle volume (V)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

Calculation of PCSA: The PCSA of each QF muscle was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the length of the muscle fibers (Lf) (Erskine et al., 2009). The Lf was calculated using the following formula: Lf = Lm * cos(h), where Lm is the length of the muscle measured from the MRI images and h is the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the patellar tendon (Erskine et al., 2009). The sum of the four PCSA values gave the total QF PCSA._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

Calculation of reduced PCSA: The PCSA of each QF muscle was multiplied by the cosine of its respective h to provide four reduced PCSA values (Erskine et al., 2009). This was done because the force generated by each component QF muscle would be reduced according to the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the patellar tendon (Erskine et al., 2009)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

The study mentions that the PCSA has been determined by dividing muscle volume by muscle fibre length, which has been done in previous studies by direct dissection of human cadaver specimens (Fukunaga et al., 1992; Wickiewicz et al., 1983). However, the weakness in measuring muscle force has been acknowledged in the study, where it is stated that the force exerted by muscle fibres is influenced and modified by various anatomical factors before it appears as the moment around a joint, making it difficult to evaluate the force-producing properties of the muscle itself from torque measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

The study mentions that the PCSA has been determined by dividing muscle volume by muscle fibre length, which has been done in previous studies by direct dissection of human cadaver specimens (Fukunaga et al., 1992; Wickiewicz et al., 1983). However, the weakness in measuring muscle force has been acknowledged in the study, where it is stated that the force exerted by muscle fibres is influenced and modified by various anatomical factors before it appears as the moment around a joint, making it difficult to evaluate the force-producing properties of the muscle itself from torque measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

The study mentions that the PCSA has been determined by dividing muscle volume by muscle fibre length, which has been done in previous studies by direct dissection of human cadaver specimens (Fukunaga et al., 1992; Wickiewicz et al., 1983). However, the weakness in measuring muscle force has been acknowledged in the study, where it is stated that the force exerted by muscle fibres is influenced and modified by various anatomical factors before it appears as the moment around a joint, making it difficult to evaluate the force-producing properties of the muscle itself from torque measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

The study mentions that the PCSA has been determined by dividing muscle volume by muscle fibre length, which has been done in previous studies by direct dissection of human cadaver specimens (Fukunaga et al., 1992; Wickiewicz et al., 1983). However, the weakness in measuring muscle force has been acknowledged in the study, where it is stated that the force exerted by muscle fibres is influenced and modified by various anatomical factors before it appears as the moment around a joint, making it difficult to evaluate the force-producing properties of the muscle itself from torque measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

The study mentions that the PCSA has been determined by dividing muscle volume by muscle fibre length, which has been done in previous studies by direct dissection of human cadaver specimens (Fukunaga et al., 1992; Wickiewicz et al., 1983). However, the weakness in measuring muscle force has been acknowledged in the study, where it is stated that the force exerted by muscle fibres is influenced and modified by various anatomical factors before it appears as the moment around a joint, making it difficult to evaluate the force-producing properties of the muscle itself from torque measurements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

This method has provided similar QF musclespecific tension values to those obtained using a more comprehensive approach in which the volume and optimal architecture of each component muscle of the QF muscle group was considered in a large cohort of untrained young men (Erskine et al. 2009). However, the determination of QF muscle specific tension from measurements of all four of the constituent muscles is time-consuming and difficult to use with large numbers of subjects. Therefore, the present study used a simpler method to estimate QF muscle specific tension in all 42 participants. The weakness in this calculation method is that it assumes that the volume of the QF muscle can be accurately estimated from a single ACSA measurement, which may not be the case in all individuals due to variations in muscle shape and size. Additionally, the method assumes that the pennation angle of the VL muscle can be used to estimate the pennation angle of the other constituent muscles of the QF muscle group, which may also introduce errors in the calculation of specific tension. |\n",

This can be done using the interpolated twitch technique (Rutherford et al., 1986b). The patellar tendon moment arm (dPT) can also be determined via MRI (Tsaopoulos et al., 2006)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

The physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) can then be calculated by dividing the ACSA by the pennation angle (PA), which is the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the muscle force (Hill, 1970). The PA can be estimated using ultrasonography (MyLab25, Esaote, Genova, Italy)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

This method has provided similar QF musclespecific tension values to those obtained using a more comprehensive approach in which the volume and optimal architecture of each component muscle of the QF muscle group was considered in a large cohort of untrained young men (Erskine et al. 2009). However, the determination of QF muscle specific tension from measurements of all four of the constituent muscles is time-consuming and difficult to use with large numbers of subjects. Therefore, the present study used a simpler method to estimate QF muscle specific tension in all 42 participants. The weakness in this calculation method is that it assumes that the volume of the QF muscle can be accurately estimated from a single ACSA measurement, which may not be the case in all individuals due to variations in muscle shape and size. Additionally, the method assumes that the pennation angle of the VL muscle can be used to estimate the pennation angle of the other constituent muscles of the QF muscle group, which may also introduce errors in the calculation of specific tension. |\n",

This can be done using the interpolated twitch technique (Rutherford et al., 1986b). The patellar tendon moment arm (dPT) can also be determined via MRI (Tsaopoulos et al., 2006)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

The physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) can then be calculated by dividing the ACSA by the pennation angle (PA), which is the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the muscle force (Hill, 1970). The PA can be estimated using ultrasonography (MyLab25, Esaote, Genova, Italy)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

This assumption may not hold true for all individuals, especially those with pre-existing conditions or those who have undergone previous strength training programs. Additionally, the accuracy of measuring muscle force and volume may also affect the calculation of specific tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study may lie in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume. While the study mentions that muscle force was calculated from steps 3 and 4, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle force. Similarly, while muscle volume was calculated from steps 6 and 7, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle volume. Without this information, it is unclear whether there were any assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume that could affect the accuracy of the specific tension calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study may lie in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume. While the study mentions that muscle force was calculated from steps 3 and 4, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle force. Similarly, while muscle volume was calculated from steps 6 and 7, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle volume. Without this information, it is unclear whether there were any assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume that could affect the accuracy of the specific tension calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study may lie in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume. While the study mentions that muscle force was calculated from steps 3 and 4, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle force. Similarly, while muscle volume was calculated from steps 6 and 7, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle volume. Without this information, it is unclear whether there were any assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume that could affect the accuracy of the specific tension calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study may lie in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume. While the study mentions that muscle force was calculated from steps 3 and 4, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle force. Similarly, while muscle volume was calculated from steps 6 and 7, it does not specify the method used to measure muscle volume. Without this information, it is unclear whether there were any assumptions made in measuring muscle force or volume that could affect the accuracy of the specific tension calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

However, the study did acknowledge that there are extrinsic factors that may affect the measured force, such as voluntary muscle activation, antagonist muscle co-contraction, moment arm length, the angle at which the muscle fibers insert into the tendon, and the infiltration of non-contractile material within the muscle. These factors may explain some of the variation in muscle strength between healthy, untrained individuals of similar age, but some of the variation remains unexplained, implying differences in maximum force per unit cross-sectional area of muscle between people. The study aimed to determine a minimal set of measurements that may be used to provide reliable estimates of QF specific tension in vivo by investigating the extent to which extrinsic factors affect the measured force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

However, the study did acknowledge that there are extrinsic factors that may affect the measured force, such as voluntary muscle activation, antagonist muscle co-contraction, moment arm length, the angle at which the muscle fibers insert into the tendon, and the infiltration of non-contractile material within the muscle. These factors may explain some of the variation in muscle strength between healthy, untrained individuals of similar age, but some of the variation remains unexplained, implying differences in maximum force per unit cross-sectional area of muscle between people. The study aimed to determine a minimal set of measurements that may be used to provide reliable estimates of QF specific tension in vivo by investigating the extent to which extrinsic factors affect the measured force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n",

Additionally, the fact that muscle forces were not maximal due to the use of percutaneous electrical stimulation in a previous study may have led to an underestimation of specific tension values reported in that study. Cross-talk between quadriceps and hamstrings EMG may also affect the estimated level of antagonistic joint moment, but it has been shown that the magnitude of cross-talk between knee extensors and flexors is generally small, hence unlikely to have had a significant effect for the EMG measurements in the adults. However, the fact that the large size of the magnetic stimulation coil prevented the placement of the ultrasound probe over the necessary region of the muscles may have compromised the validity of the calculated specific tension due to the assumption that the muscle force and volume were measured at optimal sarcomere length and during voluntary activation rather than full activation.                                                                                                                                  |\n",

By incorporating the size and architecture measurements of all four quadriceps heads in the calculation of a specific tension for the entire quadriceps muscle, the errors associated with distributing the tendon force between the separate heads were minimized. The PCSA Ã—cosÎ¸of the entire quadriceps was therefore calculated as the sum of the PCSA Ã—cosÎ¸of each quadriceps head.

These limitations include assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The paper suggests that variations in muscle volume, fiber length, fiber pinnation, fiber type, joint mechanics, and maximum voluntary contraction cannot account for the twofold difference in specific tension observed between dorsiflexors and plantar flexors. Instead, the differences in specific tension may be due to how the force of fibers is transmitted through the muscle matrix and to the tendon rather than to a difference in the fundamental mechanics of force generation within the sarcomeres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Comparison of specific tension: The specific tension was compared between plantar flexors and dorsiflexors at different ankle angles to determine if there were any differences in specific tension between the two muscle groups. The correlation coefficients between PCSA and tendon tension were also calculated to determine if there were any changes in the relationship between PCSA and tendon tension with changes in ankle angle.                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

The torque was measured in Nm (Newton-meters)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     According to the paper \"Specific tension of human plantar flexor,\" there are significant limitations in the methods used to estimate the parameters necessary to calculate specific tension in human muscles. These limitations include assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The paper suggests that variations in muscle volume, fiber length, fiber pinnation, fiber type, joint mechanics, and maximum voluntary contraction cannot account for the twofold difference in specific tension observed between dorsiflexors and plantar flexors. Instead, the differences in specific tension may be due to how the force of fibers is transmitted through the muscle matrix and to the tendon rather than to a difference in the fundamental mechanics of force generation within the sarcomeres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Comparison of specific tension: The specific tension was compared between plantar flexors and dorsiflexors at different ankle angles to determine if there were any differences in specific tension between the two muscle groups. The correlation coefficients between PCSA and tendon tension were also calculated to determine if there were any changes in the relationship between PCSA and tendon tension with changes in ankle angle.                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

These limitations include assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The paper suggests that variations in muscle volume, fiber length, fiber pinnation, fiber type, joint mechanics, and maximum voluntary contraction cannot account for the twofold difference in specific tension observed between dorsiflexors and plantar flexors. Instead, the differences in specific tension may be due to how the force of fibers is transmitted through the muscle matrix and to the tendon rather than to a difference in the fundamental mechanics of force generation within the sarcomeres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n",

Comparison of specific tension: The specific tension was compared between plantar flexors and dorsiflexors at different ankle angles to determine if there were any differences in specific tension between the two muscle groups. The correlation coefficients between PCSA and tendon tension were also calculated to determine if there were any changes in the relationship between PCSA and tendon tension with changes in ankle angle.                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n",

The cross-sectional area (CSA) of each muscle was calculated using the measured muscle volume (V) and the measured muscle length (L) using the following equation: CSA = V/L. The pennation angle (Î¸) was measured for each muscle using ultrasound imaging during the intraoperative measurement of torque. The pennation angle was used to calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) using the following equation: PCSA = CSA * cos(Î¸). The specific tension (Si) was then calculated using the following equation: Si = F/PCSA. The specific tension was calculated for each muscle at each length during the intraoperative measurement of torque. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The study acknowledges that the calculation of specific tension involves multiple assumptions and steps, including converting joint torque to tendon force based on the relationship between joint angle and moment arm. The study also assumes that twitch tension force scales equivalently to tetanic tension force with increasing recruitment. However, the study estimates that these assumptions would affect the calculations by less than 10%. Therefore, the weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study lies in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force and volume, which may introduce some level of error in the calculations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

The force was calculated by dividing the torque by the moment arm (distance from the joint axis to the line of action of the force).

Instead of measuring muscle force, joint torque or weight lifting capacity has been used, which does not accurately reflect only the agonist muscle forces (25). Additionally, a single anatomic cross-sectional area (ACSA) has typically been used to normalize these strength measurements to muscle size (44, 49), but this approach seems inappropriate because it does not take into account muscle geometry and training-induced changes thereof (35), thus underestimating the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of a pennate muscle (1, 16, 21).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

However, the study did not mention any weakness in calculation of specific tension such as assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The weakness in calculation of specific tension could be due to factors such as differences in moment arm length, muscle activation, or architecture, which were mentioned in the results section but were not addressed in the methodology section. This finding could not be explained by differences in moment arm length, muscle activation, or architecture, and other factors, such as tendinous characteristics and/or changes in moment arm length with contraction, may be held responsible. These observations warrant further investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n",

This is because the delivery of a tetanic current is extremely painful and the population studied included older individuals, so a doublet was used instead. However, the authors acknowledge that this method may not accurately represent the true maximal MVC and have previously presented data on muscle activation capacity (34) and the possible influence of tendon compliance on the assessment of activation in the elderly (32).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

The authors calculated the specific tension of the VL muscle by dividing the VL fascicle force by the VL PCSA (Maga-naris et al., 2001; Narici et al., 1992), which was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the optimum FL (measured at optimal angle during MVCs). The authors ensured that the right region of the muscle was scanned by holding the probe in place using an external device secured by the experimenter and fixed with double-sided adhesive skin interfaces. The use of an echo-absorptive external marker ensured that no probe movement occurred in relation to the digitized structure. The authors also verified the assumption of normality using the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

The moment arm was derived from cadavers and knee joints of able bodies at the same knee joint angle used in the study. However, the weakness in this calculation lies in the assumption that the moment arm increases with muscle contraction and that the moment arm from cadavers shrinks after death. The percentage increase in the moment arm during ankle extension, which is 18%, was used in the calculation of the moment arm length for this lower extremity, extensor muscle group (Maganaris et al., 2001). This assumption may not be entirely accurate for all muscle groups and may result in inaccurate specific tension calculations. Additionally, the calculation of specific tension relies on the accurate measurement of muscle force and volume, which may also introduce errors in the calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",

Measurement of torque: The maximal knee extension moment was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm). The moment arm for the patella tendon was assumed to be 4.0 cm (Wickiewicz et al., 1984; Marshall et al., 1990)._x000D__x000D_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The calculation of specific tension in this study is based on the assumption that the muscle force and volume remain constant during the period of strength training. However, this assumption may not be entirely accurate due to various factors such as changes in muscle fiber length, muscle activation level, and muscle fiber type composition. A 5% change in muscle fiber length (~0.4 cm) would result in a significant change in specific muscle tension post-training. Therefore, the calculation of specific tension may be less reliable due to the sensitivity of this measurement to small changes in muscle fiber length. Additionally, the measurement of muscle force may also be affected by factors such as the type of contraction (isometric vs. isotonic), the speed of contraction, and the level of muscle activation. These factors may lead to variations in the measurement of muscle force and subsequently affect the calculation of specific tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

This can result in an undervaluation of the stress by more than eight times due to the mechanical advantage of the joint. Additionally, the study does not take into account the fibre type composition of the muscles, which may also contribute to differences in specific tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

This can result in an undervaluation of the stress by more than eight times due to the mechanical advantage of the joint. Additionally, the study does not take into account the fibre type composition of the muscles, which may also contribute to differences in specific tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

This can result in an undervaluation of the stress by more than eight times due to the mechanical advantage of the joint. Additionally, the study does not take into account the fibre type composition of the muscles, which may also contribute to differences in specific tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

This can result in an undervaluation of the stress by more than eight times due to the mechanical advantage of the joint. Additionally, the study does not take into account the fibre type composition of the muscles, which may also contribute to differences in specific tension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n",

However, the study also acknowledges that even when electrical stimulation is used to eliminate motivational differences, a considerable range of specific tensions still persists. This highlights a weakness in the calculation of specific tension, which may involve assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The study by Haggmark et al. (1994) also suggests that the correlation between muscle CSA and limb size may be higher if the muscle is related to the extensor area rather than the total thigh musculature due to differences in functional muscle groups within the limb. Therefore, the calculation of specific tension may require more precise measurements of muscle force and volume to better isolate the effect of inter-subject differences of muscle force per CSA on individual muscle force predictions.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

This assumption may not hold true for all subjects due to variations in muscle length, tendon stiffness, and other factors that can affect the Ef ratio. Additionally, the study assumes a 31% contribution to total force output by m. biceps brachii and a 30% contribution to total force output by m. brachialis respectively (Edgerton et al., 1986), which may also be subject to variability between individuals. Finally, the study assumes an increase of 34% in the cross-sectional area in the flexed position (Ikai & Fukunaga, 1968), which may also be subject to variability between individuals and may not hold true for all subjects in this study.                                                                                                                          |\n",
