The patellar tendon moment arm (dPT) was quantified using a
0.2-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. PT was defined
as the length of the perpendicular line between the axis of the
patellar tendon and the TFCP (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006). This value
was subsequently multiplied by 1.14 to account for a 14%
increase in dPT from rest to MVC (Tsaopoulos et al. 2007).
Maximum isometric QF force (F) was thus calculated as:
F = TMT/dPT","ST= force/rPCSA

QF PCSA was multiplied by the cosine of the VL hp [which can be used as an approximation of the hp for the whole QF
muscle (Erskine et al. 2009)] to provide the reduced QF PCSA. Force was subsequently divided by the reduced
QF PCSA to provide QF specific tension.","",53 after training ,Male,"QF, after training",2201 SD 277,8.9 SD 1.4,251 SD 43,V and S,310 SD 62,6968 SD 1343,29.8 SD 6.4,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

been described elsewhere (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006).  Briefly,
dPT was quantified using a 0.2-T MRI scanner. PT was defined as
the length of the perpendicular line between the axis of the
patellar tendon and the TFCP (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006).
Previously reported values of dPT length at full extension
(0 knee flexion) and angles of 70, 80 and 90 knee flexion (Baltzopoulos 1995) were used to provide the necessary ratios with which to estimate dPT length at optimum knee

1. dPT 70/dPT 0 = 1.08
2. dPT 80/dPT 0 = 1.03
3. dPT 90/dPT 0 = 0.99
