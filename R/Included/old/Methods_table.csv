To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems Inc., Shirley, NY) at an angular velocity of 60°/s. The participants performed three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) for each leg, with a 30-second rest between each contraction. The highest torque value was recorded for each leg.
2. Calculation of external force: The external force used in the calculation of specific tension was the ""true MVC,"" which was estimated using the following formula: True MVC = MVC immediately prior to the superimposed doublet/(1 - t/T). Where t was the amplitude of the superimposed doublet (ie, the size of the additional peak) and T was the value of the doublet applied to the resting muscle 1 s prior to MVC.
3. Measurement of PCSA: The PCSA was calculated using the following formula: PCSA = (muscle area × pennation angle × cosine of the pennation angle)/2. The muscle area was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, and the pennation angle was measured using ultrasound imaging.
4. Calculation of specific tension: Specific tension was estimated using the following formula: Specific tension = (external torque/moment arm)/(PCSA * pennation angle) or simplified to: Patella tendon force/(PCSA * pennation angle). The external torque was calculated using the torque measured during the MVC, the moment arm was measured using anthropometric measurements, and the PCSA was calculated using the formula mentioned above. The pennation angle was measured using ultrasound imaging.
5. Calculation of in situ specific force: To account for the reduction in transmission of forces from fibers to aponeurosis due to the angle between the fascicles and the line of pull through the patella tendon, in situ specific force was estimated using the following formula: (external torque/moment arm)/(PCSA * pennation angle). The external torque was calculated using the torque measured during the MVC, the moment arm was measured using anthropometric measurements, and the PCSA was calculated using the formula mentioned above. The pennation angle was measured using ultrasound imaging.","

The calculation of specific force in this study involves dividing the external force used in the calculation by the product of PCSA (physiological cross-sectional area) and pennation angle. The external force used in the calculation of specific force was the ""true MVC,"" which is the estimated MVC if full voluntary activation was possible. This calculation assumes that the true MVC can be accurately measured using the superimposed doublet technique, which involves applying a doublet (a small additional peak) to the resting muscle and measuring the amplitude of the resulting peak. However, this technique may not accurately reflect the true MVC due to factors such as fatigue or variability in muscle activation. Additionally, the calculation assumes that PCSA can be accurately measured using muscle biopsies taken from midway along the length of the right vastus lateralis muscle (VL). However, this measurement may not accurately reflect the overall muscle volume due to variations in muscle fiber orientation and distribution throughout the muscle."

To calculate specific tension (N/cm2) for the gastrocnemius (GL) muscle in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque (Nm) was obtained using an isokinetic dynamometer during voluntary plantarflexion contractions at an angular velocity of 60°/s.
2. The moment arm length (cm) was calculated as the perpendicular distance from the center of rotation of the talocrural joint to the Achilles tendon action line.
3. Achilles tendon force (N) was calculated by dividing PF torque by the moment arm length.
4. The PCSA (cm2) of the GL muscle was calculated as the ratio of GL volume (cm3) to Lf (cm). Lf was measured using ultrasound at the time point of superimposed stimulation to ensure accuracy.
5. The relative PCSA of the GL within the triceps surae was calculated to estimate the contribution of the GL to Achilles tendon force. This method has been previously reported (Narici et al., 1992).
6. Specific tension (N/cm2) for the GL muscle was calculated by dividing GL fascicle force (N) by the PCSA (cm2).
7. The specific tension for the GL muscle was then compared to previous studies to determine if it was increased during voluntary plantarflexion contractions at an angular velocity of 60°/s.","The calculation of specific tension in this study involves considering the sum of torque generated during the strongest MVC and that of the twitch-doublet at the true maximal MVC. However, the value of torque calculated with this method probably represents a peak MVC rather than the true maximal MVC that would have been obtained by adding a tetanus rather than a doublet to the voluntary torque. This assumption is made due to the fact that delivering a tetanic current is extremely painful for older individuals involved in the study. Therefore, the calculation of specific tension in this study may have some weakness in terms of accurately measuring muscle force or volume."

The study aims to compare the accuracy of measurements in determining specific tension through MRI imaging and literature data.

In measuring muscle volume or cross-sectional area (CSA), the study may assume that the MRI images accurately represent the true size of the muscle.

To calculate the specific tension of a muscle, we need to determine the muscle force (F), PCSA (physiological cross-sectional area), and muscle volume (MV). In this study, we can measure the joint torque (TQ) instead of muscle force. The steps to calculate specific tension using torque, PCSA, and MV are:
1. Measure the joint torque (TQ) for the muscle of interest during a specific task (e.g., knee extension).
2. Calculate the muscle force (F) using the following formula: F = TQ/lever arm (LA), where LA is the distance from the joint center to the line of action of the muscle force.
3. Calculate the PCSA of the muscle using the following formula: PCSA = (MV/L) * (cos(θ) * sin(θ)) / (cos(θ) * sin(θ) + (L * tan(θ))), where MV is the muscle volume, L is the length of the muscle, and θ is the pennation angle (the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the muscle force).
4. Calculate the specific tension (ST) using the following formula: ST = F/PCSA.
Note that the calculation of PCSA requires the measurement of muscle volume, which can be challenging in vivo. Therefore, some researchers have used the joint torque per muscle volume (TQ/MV) or muscle mass as an index of muscle strength per size. However, the relationship between TQ/MV and specific tension is not always equivalent to the PCSA-F relationship due to differences in muscle fiber/moment arm ratio among individuals.","

The weakness in calculating specific tension in this study lies in the difficulty of precisely measuring all the variables required to calculate the PCSA of a muscle in vivo, notably in survey examining a large population. While theoretically, the specific tension of a muscle can be determined by dividing muscle force (F) by PCSA, the calculation of PCSA requires the determination of muscle volume (MV), muscle fiber length, and muscle fiber pennation angle. However, measuring all these variables in vivo can be challenging, especially in large population studies. Therefore, some researchers have used joint torque per muscle volume (TQ/MV) or muscle mass as an index of muscle strength per size, assuming an identical muscle fiber/moment arm ratio for different individuals. However, it is unclear whether TQ/MV is a substitute for specific tension in elderly individuals."

The study mentions that the EEs (elbow extensors) had weaker electromyographic (EMG) activity compared to the EFs (elbow flexors) despite having almost twice the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). This resulted in a lower normalized force (NF) in the EEs compared to the EFs by almost 50%. Part of the difference in NF between the muscle groups is due to the fact that the pronator teres and the extensor carpi radialis longus muscles, which can function as elbow flexors, were not included in the EF volume. Consequently, NF of the EFs was likely overestimated by 15% in the present study (38). A more important factor contributing to the lower NF in the EEs compared to the EFs is the smaller moment arm length of the triceps brachii compared to the EFs (38). Therefore, the study highlights that assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume can affect the calculation of specific tension. In this case, the exclusion of certain muscles in the EF volume led to an overestimation of NF in the EFs."

To calculate specific tension for this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm, Stoughton, MA) at an angular velocity of 60°/s. The torque was recorded for each participant at baseline (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training).

3. Calculation of physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA): The PCSA was calculated by multiplying the measured muscle thickness (MT) by the muscle width (MW) at the midpoint of the quadriceps muscle group (Reeves et al., 2003). The MT was measured using ultrasound (Acuson Sequoia 512, Mountain View, CA) at baseline (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The MW was measured using anthropometric measurements (height and leg length). The PCSA was calculated for each participant at baseline (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training).
4. Calculation of fascicle force (FF): The FF was calculated by multiplying the force by the cosine of the angle of pennation (P) of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle fascicles (Reeves et al., 2004).

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm, Stoughton, MA) at an angular velocity of 60° s−1. The MVC torque was recorded for each leg at the knee joint angle that produced the highest torque (optimum knee joint angle).
2. Measurement of force: Maximum patellar tendon force was measured using a force transducer (Kistler, Amherst, NY) attached to the patellar tendon via a custom-made strap. The force transducer was connected to an amplifier (Kistler, Amherst, NY) and then to a computer (Dell, Round Rock, TX) for data collection and analysis using a custom-made software program (LabView, National Instruments, Austin, TX). The maximum patellar tendon force was recorded for each leg during the MVC at the optimum knee joint angle.
3. Measurement of PCSA: The PCSA of each quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus intermedius) was calculated using the following steps:
   a. Measurement of muscle volume: The volume of each QF muscle was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (GE Signa Excite HDxt 3.0T, Milwaukee, WI) at baseline and post-training. The MRI images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of each muscle at three different levels (distal, mid-belly, and proximal) (Chow et al., 1999). The CSA of each muscle at each level was multiplied by the length of the muscle (Lf) between the measurement sites to calculate the muscle volume (V).
   b. Calculation of PCSA: The PCSA of each QF muscle was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the length of the muscle fibers (Lf) (Erskine et al., 2009). The Lf was calculated using the following formula: Lf = Lm * cos(h), where Lm is the length of the muscle measured from the MRI images and h is the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the patellar tendon (Erskine et al., 2009). The sum of the four PCSA values gave the total QF PCSA.
4. Calculation of specific tension: To calculate specific tension, the following steps were taken:
   a. Calculation of reduced PCSA: The PCSA of each QF muscle was multiplied by the cosine of its respective h to provide four reduced PCSA values (Erskine et al., 2009). This was done because the force generated by each component QF muscle would be reduced according to the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the patellar tendon (Erskine et al., 2009).
   b. Calculation of maximum patellar tendon force: The maximum patellar tendon force was calculated from the force transducer data collected during the MVC at the optimum knee joint angle.
   c. Calculation of specific tension: The specific tension was calculated by dividing the maximum patellar tendon force by the sum of the four reduced PCSA values (Erskine et al., 2009). This provided an estimate of the force per unit area of the QF muscles acting on the patellar tendon during the MVC at the optimum knee joint angle.","

The study did not mention any weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension in terms of assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The study reported that an increase in human muscle specific tension appears to be a real consequence of resistance training rather than being an artefact of measuring errors. However, the underlying cause of this phenomenon remains to be determined. The study did not provide specific details on the methods used to measure muscle force or volume, but it did mention that the maximum force generated by skeletal muscle is primarily determined by the number of sarcomeres arranged in parallel, which is represented by the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle."

The method used to calculate in vivo QF muscle specific tension before and after strength training in the present study was based on an estimate of QF muscle volume from a single anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) of the QF muscle, together with the fascicle length (Lf) and pennation angle (θp) of the VL muscle. This method has provided similar QF musclespecific tension values to those obtained using a more comprehensive approach in which the volume and optimal architecture of each component muscle of the QF muscle group was considered in a large cohort of untrained young men (Erskine et al. 2009). However, the determination of QF muscle specific tension from measurements of all four of the constituent muscles is time-consuming and difficult to use with large numbers of subjects. Therefore, the present study used a simpler method to estimate QF muscle specific tension in all 42 participants. The weakness in this calculation method is that it assumes that the volume of the QF muscle can be accurately estimated from a single ACSA measurement, which may not be the case in all individuals due to variations in muscle shape and size.

To calculate specific tension, the following steps can be followed:
1. Measure the maximum voluntary torque (MVT) of the quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle using an isokinetic dynamometer at a specific angular velocity (usually 60°/s).
2. Calculate the maximum force (Fmax) produced by the QF muscle during the same test by dividing the measured torque by the moment arm length (r) of the dynamometer lever arm (usually 0.35 m).
3. Measure the pennation angle (θ) of the QF muscle using ultrasound imaging to determine the angle between the muscle fibers and the tendon.
4. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the QF muscle using the following formula:
   PCSA = (CSA × cosθ) / Lf
   where CSA is the measured cross-sectional area of the QF muscle at the mid-point of the muscle length (Lf), and cosθ is the cosine of the pennation angle (θ).
5. Calculate the specific tension (ST) of the QF muscle by dividing the maximum force (Fmax) by the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA):
   ST = Fmax / PCSA
   where ST represents the force per unit area of the QF muscle.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each participant in the study to obtain individual values for MVC torque, Fmax, PCSA, and ST.
7. Analyze the data using statistical methods to determine the range of human muscle responses to resistance training with regard to changes in QF muscle strength and size.","

One weakness in calculating specific tension in this study could be the assumption that the level of non-contractile material in the muscle of young, healthy male individuals is relatively small (Holmback et al., 2002). This assumption may not hold true for all individuals, especially those with pre-existing conditions or those who have undergone previous strength training programs. Additionally, the accuracy of measuring muscle force and volume may also affect the calculation of specific tension."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The maximal quadriceps tendon force was calculated from the knee extension maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) by accounting for EMG-based estimates of antagonist co-activation, incomplete quadriceps activation using the interpolation twitch technique, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measurements of the patellar tendon moment arm.
2. Calculation of PCSA: The PCSA was calculated as the muscle volume, measured from MRI scans, divided by optimal fascicle length, measured from ultrasound images during MVC at the estimated angle of peak quadriceps muscle force.
3. Calculation of specific tension: Specific tension was calculated as the ratio between the quadriceps tendon force and the sum of the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) multiplied by the cosine of the angle of pennation of each head within the quadriceps muscle. The formula used was:
Speciﬁc tension =(tendon force ×cosθ−1)/PCSA (3)
where θis the angle of pennation and therefore tendon force×cosθ−1is equal to the fascicle force, and PCSA is equal to the ratio between muscle volume and optimal fascicle length. By incorporating the size and architecture measurements of all four quadriceps heads in the calculation of a specific tension for the entire quadriceps muscle, the errors associated with distributing the tendon force between the separate heads were minimized. The PCSA ×cosθof the entire quadriceps was therefore calculated as the sum of the PCSA ×cosθof each quadriceps head. The F quad w a st h e nd i v i d e db yt h e quadriceps PCSA ×cosθto determine the speciﬁc tension of the entire quadriceps muscle.","
The potential error introduced by measuring muscle architecture at MVC and in some instances not at optimal joint angle was small (∼4%), but it may still have an impact on the validity of the specific tension estimates. Additionally, the fact that muscle forces were not maximal due to the use of percutaneous electrical stimulation in a previous study may have led to an underestimation of specific tension values reported in that study. Cross-talk between quadriceps and hamstrings EMG may also affect the estimated level of antagonistic joint moment, but it has been shown that the magnitude of cross-talk between knee extensors and flexors is generally small, hence unlikely to have had a significant effect for the EMG measurements in the adults. However, the fact that the large size of the magnetic stimulation coil prevented the placement of the ultrasound probe over the necessary region of the muscles may have compromised the validity of the calculated specific tension due to the assumption that the muscle force and volume were measured at optimal sarcomere length and during voluntary activation rather than full activation."

To calculate specific tension (N/cm2), we need to know the torque (Nm), force (N), and PCSA (cm2) of the muscle being studied. The specific tension can be calculated using the following formula:

Specific tension (N/cm2) = (torque (Nm) / PCSA (cm2)) / force (N)

In this study, the torque was measured during isometric plantarflexions of increasing intensity up to MVC (maximum voluntary contraction). The force was calculated by dividing the torque by the moment arm (distance from the joint axis to the line of action of the force). The PCSA was calculated using the equation:

PCSA = (V / Lf) cos0

where V is the muscle volume (cm3) and Lf is the fibre length (cm). The angle of pennation (0) was measured using ultrasound imaging. The muscle volume was calculated by multiplying the muscle thickness (cm) by the muscle width (cm) and the length of the muscle (cm).

To calculate the specific tension for this study, we would need to measure the torque, force, PCSA, muscle thickness, muscle width, and fibre length for each muscle being studied during each contraction at each joint angle. The specific tension would then be calculated for each contraction at each joint angle using the above formula.","
The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study is highlighted by the authors themselves when they state that ""calculations of muscle specific tension made without using the PCSA relating to the joint angle at which the force was measured maybe considerably wrong."" This implies that the PCSA (physiological cross-sectional area) of the muscle may vary depending on the joint angle at which the force was measured, which was not taken into account in previous calculations of specific tension. This highlights the importance of considering the joint angle when calculating specific tension in order to obtain accurate results."

To calculate specific tension (N/cm²) in this study, the following steps need to be taken:
1. Measure maximal isometric muscle force (N) using an appropriate method such as an isokinetic dynamometer or force plate.
2. Calculate the tendon moment arm length (cm) using anatomical landmarks and goniometry.
3. Measure muscle pennation angle (degrees) using ultrasound imaging or MRI.

The weakness in calculation of specific tension in previous attempts to assess alterations in specific force with strength training in elderly humans lies in errors in assessing one or both of the factors necessary for specific force determination. Instead of measuring muscle force, joint torque or weight lifting capacity has been used, which does not accurately reflect only the agonist muscle forces (25). Additionally, a single anatomic cross-sectional area (ACSA) has typically been used to normalize these strength measurements to muscle size (44, 49), but this approach seems inappropriate because it does not take into account muscle geometry and training-induced changes thereof (35), thus underestimating the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of a pennate muscle (1, 16, 21)."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The peak torque (PT) was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm, Stoughton, MA) during plantarflexion of the ankle joint at an angular velocity of 60°/s. The torque was measured in Nm.
2. Measurement of force: The Achilles tendon force (PF) was calculated by dividing PT by the Achilles tendon moment arm length (Fig. 3). The force was measured in N.
3. Calculation of PCSA: The pennate angle (θ) was measured from the ultrasound images of the GL muscle (Fig. 1). The pennate angle was used to calculate the pennation angle-corrected physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the GL muscle using the following formula:

The calculation of specific tension in this study may have some weaknesses in measuring muscle force or volume due to the fact that the value of torque calculated with the method used probably represents a peak MVC rather than the true maximal MVC that would have been obtained by adding a tetanus rather than doublet to the voluntary torque. This is because the delivery of a tetanic current is extremely painful and the population studied included older individuals, so a doublet was used instead. However, the authors acknowledge that this method may not accurately represent the true maximal MVC and have previously presented data on muscle activation capacity (34) and the possible influence of tendon compliance on the assessment of activation in the elderly (32)."

5. Calculate muscle volume (cm3) by multiplying the activated CSA (cm2) in each slice by 2 cm (slice thickness + interslice space) and adding the slices together to obtain the volume of activated tissue.
6. Use a pennation angle of 15.6° (Fukunaga et al., 2001) to calculate the PCSA of mQF.","

In this study, the calculation of specific tension involves dividing the torque obtained for the Wrst contraction of the four di Ver-ent SNMES protocols by the patellar tendon moment arm length of the mQF. The moment arm was derived from cadavers and knee joints of able bodies at the same knee joint angle used in the study. However, the weakness in this calculation lies in the assumption that the moment arm increases with muscle contraction and that the moment arm from cadavers shrinks after death. The percentage increase in the moment arm during ankle extension, which is 18%, was used in the calculation of the moment arm length for this lower extremity, extensor muscle group (Maganaris et al., 2001). This assumption may not be entirely accurate for all muscle groups and may result in inaccurate specific tension calculations. Additionally, the calculation of specific tension relies on the accurate measurement of muscle force and volume, which may also introduce errors in the calculation."

To calculate specific tension (N cm^-3) for this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The maximal knee extension moment was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm). The moment arm for the patella tendon was assumed to be 4.0 cm (Wickiewicz et al., 1984; Marshall et al., 1990).
2. Estimation of quadriceps force: Quadriceps force (Fquad) was estimated from the measurement of maximal knee extension moment using the following formula: Fquad = Mmax/cos( p), where Mmax is the maximal knee extension moment and p is the angle of knee flexion (Wickiewicz et al., 1984; Marshall et al., 1990).
3. Estimation of patella tendon force: The ratio of patella tendon force to quadriceps tendon force was assumed to be 0.70 at 70 deg knee flexion (Nisell et al., 1989). Therefore, patella tendon force (Fpat) was calculated using the following formula: Fpat = Fquad x 0.70.
4. Calculation of PCSA: The cross-sectional area of the quadriceps muscle (PCSA) was estimated using the following formula: PCSA = (Fquad/cos( p))/(maximal specific tension), where maximal specific tension was assumed to be 42.6 N cm^-3 before the period of strength training and 45.3 N cm^-3 after the period of strength training (based on previous studies).
5. Calculation of specific tension: Specific tension was calculated using the following formula: Specific tension = Fpat/PCSA (N cm^-3).
It should be noted that the above calculations are highly sensitive to even small changes in muscle fibre length. For example, a 5% change in muscle fibre length (~0.4 cm) would result in a specific muscle tension of 42.5 N cm^-3 post-training.","

The calculation of specific tension in this study is based on the assumption that the muscle force and volume remain constant during the period of strength training. However, this assumption may not be entirely accurate due to various factors such as changes in muscle fiber length, muscle activation level, and muscle fiber type composition. A 5% change in muscle fiber length (~0.4 cm) would result in a significant change in specific muscle tension post-training. Therefore, the calculation of specific tension may be less reliable due to the sensitivity of this measurement to small changes in muscle fiber length. Additionally, the measurement of muscle force may also be affected by factors such as the type of contraction (isometric vs. isotonic), the speed of contraction, and the level of muscle activation. These factors may lead to variations in the measurement of muscle force and subsequently affect the calculation of specific tension."

To calculate specific tension (force per cross-sectional area) for this study, the following steps can be followed:

The study by Dowling (1994) emphasizes the importance of using the best fitting specific tension in the calculation of individual muscle forces rather than relying on a single value taken from literature. However, the study also acknowledges that even when electrical stimulation is used to eliminate motivational differences, a considerable range of specific tensions still persists. This highlights a weakness in the calculation of specific tension, which may involve assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. The study by Haggmark et al. (1994) also suggests that the correlation between muscle CSA and limb size may be higher if the muscle is related to the extensor area rather than the total thigh musculature due to differences in functional muscle groups within the limb. Therefore, the calculation of specific tension may require more precise measurements of muscle force and volume to better isolate the effect of inter-subject differences of muscle force per CSA on individual muscle force predictions."

To calculate the specific tension of m. quadriceps femoris, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of maximal isometric torque: The highest recording was multiplied by cos 35"" times the lever arm (distance from knee joint to ankle cuff) (see Table 1). This value was defined as the maximal isometric torque.
2. Measurement of force: Force was then recorded at velocities between 40 and 800"" s-'. Velocity was measured with the two photocells placed at 120"" and 130"" of knee extension. Registration was performed at the ankle cuff.
3. Calculation of PCSA: The ratio of moment arm (0.038 m in young subjects according to Ekholm et al. 1984) and lever arm (0.39 m within the young group) was assumed to be 1/10 for all subjects.
4. Calculation of specific tension: The specific tension of m. quadriceps femoris was calculated by dividing the maximal isometric torque (step 1) by the PCSA (step 3). This value represents the force per unit cross-sectional area of the muscle.","

One potential weakness in the calculation of specific tension in this study is the assumption that the ratio of Ef (the ratio of the force exerted by the muscle to the force exerted by the tendon) is the same for all subjects between the moment arm (0.038 m and 0.029 m in young subjects according to Edgerton et al., 1986) and the lever arm (0.35 m within the young group) (page_label: 3, file_path: /content/processed_pdf/2899 Klitgaard et al. - 1990 - Function, morphology and protein expression of age.pdf). This assumption may not hold true for all subjects due to variations in muscle length, tendon stiffness, and other factors that can affect the Ef ratio. Additionally, the study assumes a 31% contribution to total force output by m. biceps brachii and a 30% contribution to total force output by m. brachialis respectively (Edgerton et al., 1986), which may also be subject to variability between individuals. Finally, the study assumes an increase of 34% in the cross-sectional area in the flexed position (Ikai & Fukunaga, 1968), which may also be subject to variability between individuals and may not hold true for all subjects in this study."
