The lower values could not be explained by submaximal activation of the quadriceps since it was demonstrated by the twitch-superimposition technique that the subjects were able to produce maximum contractions. The force measured was that generated at the ankle through the lever system of the knee and lower leg. Assuming a mechanical advantage of 0.132 (Narici et al. 1988; Smidt 1973), the forces generated in the patellar tendon would be 4515 N giving a specific force of 621 kN m-2 (calculated using the anatomical CSA). This value is comparable to those previously reported in the literature for the quadriceps."

2648,O'Brien 2010,In vivo measurements of muscle specific tension in adults and children.,UK,Cross sectional study,"The specific tensions reported here (∼55 N cm−2) are in line with those estimated in optimized musculoskeletal models (Cholewicki et al. 1995; Pain & Forrester, 2009),but notably higher than the typical values of ∼30 N cm−2reported in previous in vivo studies of the knee extensormuscles (Narici et al. 1992; Chow et al. 1999; Reeves et al. 2004). However, Chow et al. (1999) acknowledgedthat they had underestimated specific tension because of inaccurate estimates of fascicle pennation, failure to account for antagonist activation and the use of mean muscle force across a number of trials rather than maximal muscle force. Narici et al. (1992) and Reeves et al. (2004)did not account for the force that is lost in the transmission of quadriceps force through the patella to the tibia (Buffet al. 1988), and used F pt to calculate specific tension rather than Fquad. At the mean knee angle of 65 deg,this loss of force is equal to a third of Fquad. If the specific tension calculated in the present study had been calculated from the F pt, rather than Fquad, this would have resulted in estimates of ∼37 N cm−2, which are much closer to those previously reported. Additionally, in thepresent study F pt was calculated from PTMA lengthsmeasured at rest, which are smaller than those during contraction (Tsaopoulos et al. 2007). Had PTMA lengths during contraction been used, according to the findings of Tsaopoulos et al. (2007), the specific tension in the men would have been ∼34 N cm−2.

The specific tension values obtained in the present study are also much higher than those reported by Maganaris et al.(2001; 15 N cm−2).Such a large difference is most probably due to the fact that specific tension in that study was underestimated because muscle forces were not maximal, since the muscles studied were activated by percutaneous electrical stimulation, which is unlikely to recruit the whole muscle"
