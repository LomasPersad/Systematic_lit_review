The patella tendon moment arm was imaged with the leg at full extension and estimated from sagittal plane slices as the distance from the mid-contact point between the femoral condyles and tibial plateau to the patella tendon. The moment arm length was multiplied by 0.99 to adjust for the difference between full knee extension to 90° flexion (24) [the angle at which maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured] and the resulting value was multiplied by 1.14 to adjust for the 14% increase in moment arm in transition from rest to MVC

The patella tendon force was estimated
from the moment equilibrium equation around the knee joint (27) by dividing the MVC torque by the patella tendon moment arm length.

For calculations of in situ specific force, the quadriceps PCSA was multiplied by the cosine of the fascicle pennation angle to account for the reduction in transmission of forces from fibers to aponeurosis to adjust for the angle between the fascicles and the line of pull through the patella tendon. Specific force was estimated as: [(external torque/moment arm)/(PCSA * pennation angle)] or simplified to: [Patella tendon force/(PCSA * pennation angle)

Two isometric maximal voluntary plantarflexion contractions (MVC) were performed at an ankle joint angle of -20° (the foot in dorsiflexion), 2 min separated each MVC attempt. The foot was placed at -20° as this has previously been shown to be the optimum fascicle length within the physiological range of the gastrocnemius muscle (Maganaris2003)

The sum of the torque generated during the strongest MVC and that of the twitch-doublet was considered at the true maximal MVC and used for the calculation ofspecific tension [as described previously by Fukunaga et al. (1996) and Maganaris et al. (2001)

The value of torque calculated with this method probably represents a peak MVC, and not the true maximal MVC as would have been obtained by adding a tetanus rather than doublet to the voluntary torque. However, considering that the delivery of a tetanic current is extremely painful and that the population involved older individuals, we opted to use a doublet instead.
Two maximal isometric dorsiflexion (DF) contractions were performed after the PF MVC to obtain maximal dorsiflexion electromyographic (EMG) data for calculation of antagonist co-activation in the tibialis anterior. PF and DF MVC attempts were held for approximately 4 s, a time amply sufficient to reach a torque plateau.

In order to obtain an estimation of specific force without the confounding variable of increased muscle activation resulting from training, supramaximal doublets were superimposed over the second plantarflexor MVC.

The plantarflexor torque used in the estimation of specific force was determined as: PF MVC torque +superimposed doublet torque, as described previously (Maganaris et al. 2001).

The co-activation torque produced by the dorsiflexors was estimated assuming a linear relation between torque and EMG activity. To determine isolated plantar flexor torque, the dorsiflexor coactivation torque was added to the net plantarflexor torque that was obtained during Plantarflexor MVC.
","In vivo MRI was performed to determine moment arm

In vivo MRI was performed to determine moment arm length of the achilles tendon at rest. A series of sagittal plane scans were taken of the left ankle with the foot secured at a right angle to the tibia (0°), at ¡ 20° dorsiflexion and 20° plantarflexion. Three scans were required to determine the centre of rotation of the talocrural joint from the method described previously (Rugg et al. 1990).

Achilles tendon force was calculated by dividing PF
torque by the achilles tendon moment arm length.

In order to estimate the contribution of the GL to achilles tendon force, the relative PCSA of the GL within the triceps surae was calculated


We have previously determined that the GL constitutes 11% of the triceps surae PCSA(Morse et al. 2005a), and the triceps surae group was estimated to represent 91% of the total PF PCSA in the elderly (Wickiewicz et al. 1983); hence this seems to justify the assumption that the triceps surae PCSA represents the main PCSA of the plantarflexors

Once the GL component of the achilles tendon force was calculated, this was divided by cos  to determine the fascicle force (Ff).

Specific force of the GL muscle was calculated by dividing GL Ff by GL PCSA.

However, recent experiments in adults and children indicate that the level of knee extensor muscle activation does not differ across knee joint angles and that the ITT outcome at 90 deg knee flexion is a realistic estimate of voluntary activation for the quadriceps muscle across all knee joint angles (O’Brien et al. 2009b)
