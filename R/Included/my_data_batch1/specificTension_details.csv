A minimum of two
maximal voluntarily isometric leg extensions (MVCs) were performed on the chair of an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm; Cybex International, New York,
NY, USA) at 70, 80 and 90
 of knee flexion.  Each MVC lasted 2–3 s with a rest interval of 2 min between each contraction. Antagonist
muscle co-activation was estimated by determining the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the biceps femoris muscle during MVC. The interpolated twitch technique was used to determine the level of maximal voluntary QF muscle activation at 90
 of knee flexion. This level
of activation was applied to the MVC at optimum
angle, which, when corrected for antagonist muscle co-activation, provided true maximum torque (TMT). To calculate maximum QF muscle force recorded at the patellar tendon, it was necessary to divide TMT by the patellar tendon moment arm length (dPT).
Maximum patellar tendon
force (Ft) was thus calculated as TMT/dPT.","As the force generated by each component QF muscle would be reduced according to
the hp when resolved along the patellar tendon, each constituent muscle PCSA was multiplied by the cosine

been described elsewhere (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006).  Briefly,
dPT was quantified using a 0.2-T MRI scanner. PT was defined as
the length of the perpendicular line between the axis of the
patellar tendon and the TFCP (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006).
Previously reported values of dPT length at full extension
(0 knee flexion) and angles of 70, 80 and 90 knee flexion (Baltzopoulos 1995) were used to provide the necessary ratios with which to estimate dPT length at optimum knee
joint angle, i.e.
1. dPT 70/dPT 0 = 1.08
2. dPT 80/dPT 0 = 1.03
3. dPT 90/dPT 0 = 0.99

angle, which was subsequently multiplied by 1.14 to
account for a 14% increase in dPT from rest to MVC

were measured in scans at 18.9 mm intervals, using OsiriX dicom viewer The volume of each muscle head was
calculated as the sum of the cross-sectional area in all scans multiplied by the distance between each measured
slice (1.89 cm)","The fascicle
length, taking into account any curvature, was measured
from the point of insertion on the superficial and deep
aponeuroses","PCSA is
equal to the ratio between muscle volume and optimal
fascicle length","The MVC moment produced by the quadriceps (QuadMVC) was estimated as the sum of the measured joint moment (JointMVC) and the calculated antagonist moment. To correct for any deficit in voluntary activation andthus to estimate the moment that would be produced by the quadriceps if they were fully activated (Quad100%)

Participants were seated and securely strapped on the seat of an isokinetic dynamometer. The test trials consisted of two isometric maximal
voluntary knee extensions (MVCs) at every 5 deg of knee
flexion from 55 to 90 deg (where 0 deg is full extension), performed in a randomized order and with ∼2 min rest.
","F_pt=QF MVC at100%/MA

 Fquad was calculated from the F pt using the ratios provided by Buff et al. (1988), which account for the fact that the patella is not a frictionless pulley for transmitting force from the quadriceps to the tibia.

The PTMA was measured from sagittal-plane magnetic resonance images (MRI) taken at each knee angle with
a 0.2 T MRI scanner .The MVC moment produced by the quadriceps
(QuadMVC) was estimated as the sum of the measured
joint moment (JointMVC) and the calculated antagonist moment. To correct for any deficit in voluntary activation and thus to estimate the moment that would be produced by the quadriceps if they were fully activated (Quad100%) the
QuadMVC moment and ITT were used in eqn (2), assuming a linear relationship between moment and voluntary The calculated Quad100% was then used to calculate peak
patellar tendon force (F pt) during a fully activated effort
by dividing Quad100% by the PTMA at the knee angle measured by the goniometer during that trial. Finally, the Fquad was calculated from the F pt using the ratios provided by Buff et al. (1988), which account for the fact that the patella is not a frictionless pulley for transmitting force from the quadriceps to the tibia.
","Specific tension = (tendon force × cos θ−1)/PCSA


fascicle force/PCSA

The PCSA × cos θ of the entire quadriceps was therefore calculated as the sum of the PCSA × cos θ of each quadriceps head. The Fquad was then divided by the quadriceps PCSA × cos θ to determine the specific tension of the entire quadriceps muscle.",,2052.7,,231.8,328.85,11439.0,55.02
