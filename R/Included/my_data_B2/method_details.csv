For the measurements, the subjects were seated on the dynamometer chair, with the knees flexed at 10° as measured by a goniometer (0° corresponding to full extension of the knee), the legs supported and the muscles relaxed. This knee bend was selected because it does not cause excessive stretch of the hamstrings in a seated position (Reeves et al. 2009) and helps to reduce the fascicle curvature, improving measurement reliability

Antagonist muscle coactivation was estimated by determining the electromyographic activity of the biceps femoris (BF) muscle during each MVC.

The interpolated twitch technique was used to determine the level of maximal voluntary agonist muscle activation at 90° of knee flexion, as described previously (Erskine et al. 2009). This level of activation was applied to the peak extension torque obtained on each MVC, which, when corrected for antagonist muscle coactivation, provided the relative joint maximal torque (RJMT).
