current increased to deliver supramaximal “doublet” (two 200-μs pulses separated by 10 ms) stimuli over the quadriceps muscle group. Stimulation was applied to the relaxed muscle 1  s prior to a maximal voluntary effort and then again at the highest point of the MVC. In the cross-sectional study, a third doublet was also applied 2 s after the MVC. The voluntary activation test was performed twice and the result giving the highest voluntary activation was accepted.","pecific force was estimated as: 
[(external torque/moment arm)/(PCSA * pennation angle)] or simpli-
fied to: [Patella tendon force/(PCSA * pennation angle)] 

The patella tendon moment arm was imaged with the leg at full extension and estimated from sagittal plane slices as the distance from the mid-contact point between the femoral condyles and tibial plateau to the patella tendon. The moment arm length was multiplied by 0.99 to adjust for the difference between full knee extension to 90° flexion (24) [the angle at which maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured] and the resulting value was multiplied by 1.14 to adjust for the 14% increase in moment arm in transition from rest to MVC

The patella tendon force was estimated
from the moment equilibrium equation around the knee joint (27) by dividing the MVC torque by the patella tendon moment arm length.

For calculations of in situ specific force, the quadriceps PCSA was multiplied by the cosine of the fascicle pennation angle to account for the reduction in transmission of forces from fibers to aponeurosis to adjust for the angle between the fascicles and the line of pull through the patella tendon. Specific force was estimated as: [(external torque/moment arm)/(PCSA * pennation angle)] or simplified to: [Patella tendon force/(PCSA * pennation angle)

The external force used in the calculation of specific force was the “true MVC”, which is the estimated MVC if full voluntary activation was possible: True MVC = MVC immediately prior to the superimposed doublet/(1 – t/T). Where t was the amplitude of the superimposed doublet (ie, the size of the additional peak) and T the value of the doublet applied to the resting muscle 1 s prior to MVC.","","","","","","","","","","","","","",Cross sectional study,"","16, young man (YM)",23 SD 4,176 SD 6,70.6 SD 8.3,"","15, young women, (YW)",22 SD 2,167 SD 6,61.2 SD 10.7,"","20, Old men (OM)",72 SD 5,174 SD 8,78.9 SD 14.4,"","20, Old women (OW)",71 SD 4,160 SD 7,67.3 SD 12,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",16 young men,M,QF,"","VL 9.06+/-1.13,

Two isometric maximal voluntary plantarflexion contractions (MVC) were performed at an ankle joint angle of -20° (the foot in dorsiflexion), 2 min separated each MVC attempt. The foot was placed at -20° as this has previously been shown to be the optimum fascicle length within the physiological range of the gastrocnemius muscle (Maganaris2003)

The sum of the torque generated during the strongest MVC and that of the twitch-doublet was considered at the true maximal MVC and used for the calculation ofspecific tension [as described previously by Fukunaga et al. (1996) and Maganaris et al. (2001)

The value of torque calculated with this method probably represents a peak MVC, and not the true maximal MVC as would have been obtained by adding a tetanus rather than doublet to the voluntary torque. However, considering that the delivery of a tetanic current is extremely painful and that the population involved older individuals, we opted to use a doublet instead.
Two maximal isometric dorsiflexion (DF) contractions were performed after the PF MVC to obtain maximal dorsiflexion electromyographic (EMG) data for calculation of antagonist co-activation in the tibialis anterior. PF and DF MVC attempts were held for approximately 4 s, a time amply sufficient to reach a torque plateau.

In order to obtain an estimation of specific force without the confounding variable of increased muscle activation resulting from training, supramaximal doublets were superimposed over the second plantarflexor MVC.

The plantarflexor torque used in the estimation of specific force was determined as: PF MVC torque +superimposed doublet torque, as described previously (Maganaris et al. 2001).

The co-activation torque produced by the dorsiflexors was estimated assuming a linear relation between torque and EMG activity. To determine isolated plantar flexor torque, the dorsiflexor coactivation torque was added to the net plantarflexor torque that was obtained during Plantarflexor MVC.
","In vivo MRI was performed to determine moment arm
length of the achilles tendon at rest.  F=tq/MA

In vivo MRI was performed to determine moment arm length of the achilles tendon at rest. A series of sagittal plane scans were taken of the left ankle with the foot secured at a right angle to the tibia (0°), at ¡ 20° dorsiflexion and 20° plantarflexion. Three scans were required to determine the centre of rotation of the talocrural joint from the method described previously (Rugg et al. 1990).

Achilles tendon force was calculated by dividing PF
torque by the achilles tendon moment arm length.

In order to estimate the contribution of the GL to achilles tendon force, the relative PCSA of the GL within the triceps surae was calculated


We have previously determined that the GL constitutes 11% of the triceps surae PCSA(Morse et al. 2005a), and the triceps surae group was estimated to represent 91% of the total PF PCSA in the elderly (Wickiewicz et al. 1983); hence this seems to justify the assumption that the triceps surae PCSA represents the main PCSA of the plantarflexors

Once the GL component of the achilles tendon force was calculated, this was divided by cos  to determine the fascicle force (Ff).

Specific force of the GL muscle was calculated by dividing GL Ff by GL PCSA.

Axial sections were then clearly marked along the muscle at intervals of 30 mm from the proximal insertion

The VL muscle PCSA was calculated by dividing muscle volume by fascicle length (1, 21, 30). This calculation assumes a muscle model that is cylindrical in shape, with fibers of constant length.

Maximal isometric knee extension and flexion torque were assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer at nine knee joint angles, ranging from 90 to 10°, in 10° increments (full extension 0°), with the hip angle at 85° (supine position 0°)
When the voluntary torque peaked, a superimposed supramaximal double twitch with 50- s pulse width and 50-ms inter stimulus gap was applied. The doublet was generated by an electrical stimulator
The point at which a further increase in current by 50 mA failed to increase the twitch torque was defined as the supramaximal stimulation intensity. The voluntary activation capacity of the quadriceps muscle group was calculated as maximum voluntary torque/(maximum voluntary torque + superimposed stimulation torque),

The root mean square (RMS) EMG activity of the BF and VL muscles was measured over a 50-ms time period corresponding to maximal isometric knee extension torque

To estimate the level of antagonistic co contraction from the knee flexors, the BF muscle RMS EMG activity was measured during maximal isometric knee flexion

Training resulted in a 19% increase in specific force, from 27 to 32 N/cm2.Specific force values obtained in the present study are in line with previous reports of 15–38 N/cm2 obtained in human muscle (21, 30, 36) and 15–29 N/cm2 obtained in animal muscle (9, 39, 45). It should be stressed that, in contrast to single-fiber experiments where activation remains at a given level (47, 48), changes in activation level might occur when contractions are performed with voluntary effort, and this should be accounted for in the estimation of specific force. If specific force had been calculated from the voluntary torque only, the post training increase observed would partly reflect differences in the activation level found. However, this problem was largely avoided in the present study because, in both pre- and post training conditions, the calculation of specific force encompassed parameters measured at the time of supra-maximal electrical stimuli superimposed on the voluntary effort. Artificial maximal activation of the entire muscle would entirely eliminate this problem, but this would require supra-maximal tetanic stimulation through the femoral nerve, a procedure that may cause considerable discomfort, raising ethical considerations for its use with elderly populations."

this was then expressed as the percentage EMG activity recorded from
the tibialis anterior during maximal dorsiflexion (21, 23, 24). Torque
produced by the dorsiflexors during plantarflexion was estimated
assuming a linear relation between torque and EMG activity, which
has previously been reported from the tibialis anterior muscle (29). To
obtain an estimate of plantarflexion peak torque, dorsiflexion torque
during plantarflexion was added to the net MVC plantarflexion torque."

A proton density echo protocol (repetition time 4140 ms, echo time 7.5 ms, field of view 512 × 512 mm, slice thickness 4 mm, gap between slices 0.0 mm) was used to continuously scan the thighs from the superior border of the patella to the greater trochanter.

Longitudinal images were taken from the mid-belly of the VL muscle, corresponding to 39% of the distance from the proximal edge of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine

For the measurements, the subjects were seated on the dynamometer chair, with the knees flexed at 10° as measured by a goniometer (0° corresponding to full extension of the knee), the legs supported and the muscles relaxed. This knee bend was selected because it does not cause excessive stretch of the hamstrings in a seated position (Reeves et al. 2009) and helps to reduce the fascicle curvature, improving measurement reliability

Both FL and PA were measured during MVCs at the same site used for muscle architecture measurements",PCSA was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the optimum FL (measured at optimal angle during MVC).,"Subjects were seated on the dynamometer chair and firmly strapped at the hip, at the chest and over the thigh to minimize extraneous movement.

Antagonist muscle coactivation was estimated by determining the electromyographic activity of the biceps femoris (BF) muscle during each MVC.

The interpolated twitch technique was used to determine the level of maximal voluntary agonist muscle activation at 90° of knee flexion, as described previously (Erskine et al. 2009). This level of activation was applied to the peak extension torque obtained on each MVC, which, when corrected for antagonist muscle coactivation, provided the relative joint maximal torque (RJMT).

The joint angle at which the highest RJMT occurred was considered the optimal knee joint angle (optimal angle) and all subsequent calculations were made at this angle","TQ/MA. MA acquired from MRI.

to calculate the quadriceps forces at the patellar tendon, the highest RJMT was divided by the patellar tendon moment arm (ⅆPT), which was estimated at the peak torque of the MVCs

ⅆPT was determined from sagittal and coronal-plane knee scans obtained with an MRI scanner. The knee was scanned at rest with the participant in the supine position and the joint fully extended. Corrections were made for the difference between ⅆPT at full extension and at the optimal angle (Baltzopoulos 1995) and between rest and MVC (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006), providing the maximal quadriceps force.

The relative contribution of the VL muscle to the maximal quadriceps force was estimated from its relative PCSA with respect to the entire quadriceps muscle group

To our knowledge, such a result has not been reported previously. Although increases in specific tension after high-intensity resistance training have been reported previously (Erskine et al. 2010; Reeves et al. 2004), this is the first study report-ing differential adaptations to full vs. partial ROM. As PART ROM training-induced changes in the VL PCSA (7.8%) and fascicle force (20.2%), the VL specific tension remained unchanged in the PART group. Conversely, because FULL training increased both the FL and muscle volume (4.9 and 7.6% increase, respectively), the PCSA remained unchanged in the FULL group. Consequently, FULL training induced an increase in the VL specific tension (i.e., maximum muscle force per PCSA), as a result of a disproportionate increase in the fascicle force relative to the PCSA (29.7 and 2.5% increase, respectively). This discrepancy between the increase in muscle strength and size often reported follow-ing resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010) is commonly explained by the neural adaptations being greater than the muscle hypertrophy (Staron et al. 1994). However, the voluntary quadriceps muscle activation in the FULL group increased only 1.8% (nonsignificant, Table 4), which is quite similar to previous reports of increased muscle activa-tion after resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010; Reeves et al. 2004). Furthermore, although there was a trend toward decreases, there was no significant change in the level of antagonist muscle coactivation following training (− 16%, without statistical significance, Table 4). Therefore, correct-ing MVC for voluntary muscle activation, antagonist muscle coactivation and ⅆPT (which remained unchanged after train-ing) gave a 27.8% increase in the maximal quadriceps force (Table 4), thus demonstrating that training-induced changes in voluntary activation, coactivation and ⅆPT contributed little (4.2%) to the increase in MVC torque. Although we cannot deduce the source for the VL specific tension increase in the FULL group from the present results, some explanations have been presented as being able to cause the change in whole-muscle specific tension (Erskine et al. 2010). Among the factors that may explain this phenomenon are the increase in the number of thick myofilaments per unit area (packing density) (Pansarasa et al. 2009), a change in muscle fiber-type composition and/or preferential muscle fiber hypertrophy of type II fibers (Campos et al. 2002), and/or a possible change in the quality of attachment between the contractile muscle fibers and the surrounding connective tis-sue through which force is transmitted to tendons and bones (Erskine et al. 2010)"

by dividing Quad100% by the PTMA at the knee angle measured by the goniometer during that trial. Finally, the Fquad was calculated from the F pt using the ratios provided by Buff et al. (1988), which account for the fact that the patella is not a frictionless pulley for transmitting force from the quadriceps to the tibia.
","Specific tension = (tendon force × cos θ−1)/PCSA


fascicle force/PCSA

The PCSA × cos θ of the entire quadriceps was therefore calculated as the sum of the PCSA × cos θ of each quadriceps head. The Fquad was then divided by the quadriceps PCSA × cos θ to determine the specific tension of the entire quadriceps muscle.","",10 women,F,QF,1359.2 SD 267.8,"",162.8 SD 29.8,"",214.74 SD 63.6,8695 SD 2586,57.3 SD 12.6,"","","","","","","",10 boys,B,QF,708.6 SD 136.3,"",104.6 SD 20,"",110.6 SD 33.4,5234 SD 1248,54.06 SD 14.2,"","","","","","","",10 girls,G,QF,793.8 SD 145,"",108.2 SD 18.5,"",142.6 SD 48.7,6117 SD 1852,59.77 SD 15.3,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The specific tensions reported here (∼55 N cm−2) are in line with those estimated in optimized musculoskeletal models (Cholewicki et al. 1995; Pain & Forrester, 2009),but notably higher than the typical values of ∼30 N cm−2reported in previous in vivo studies of the knee extensormuscles (Narici et al. 1992; Chow et al. 1999; Reeves et al. 2004). However, Chow et al. (1999) acknowledgedthat they had underestimated specific tension because of inaccurate estimates of fascicle pennation, failure to account for antagonist activation and the use of mean muscle force across a number of trials rather than maximal muscle force. Narici et al. (1992) and Reeves et al. (2004)did not account for the force that is lost in the transmission of quadriceps force through the patella to the tibia (Buffet al. 1988), and used F pt to calculate specific tension rather than Fquad. At the mean knee angle of 65 deg,this loss of force is equal to a third of Fquad. If the specific tension calculated in the present study had been calculated from the F pt, rather than Fquad, this would have resulted in estimates of ∼37 N cm−2, which are much closer to those previously reported. Additionally, in thepresent study F pt was calculated from PTMA lengthsmeasured at rest, which are smaller than those during contraction (Tsaopoulos et al. 2007). Had PTMA lengths during contraction been used, according to the findings of Tsaopoulos et al. (2007), the specific tension in the men would have been ∼34 N cm−2.

The specific tension values obtained in the present study are also much higher than those reported by Maganaris et al.(2001; 15 N cm−2).Such a large difference is most probably due to the fact that specific tension in that study was underestimated because muscle forces were not maximal, since the muscles studied were activated by percutaneous electrical stimulation, which is unlikely to recruit the whole muscle"
