the extensor carpi radialis longus muscles, which together generate 15% of EF torque (38), were not included in the EF
volume because they were not clearly visible in the images over their entire length. The brachioradialis, extensor carpi
radialis longus, and brevis muscles were traced as a group. The brachioradialis volume was then estimated to be 39% of
the combined volume of these three muscles (4). The length of the brachioradialis, however, could be determined because
the origin and insertion regions were clearly evident in all images. The coracobrachialis muscle was traced as part of the
biceps brachii because these two muscles could not be separated convincingly throughout their entire length. In both
young and old cadavers, the coracobrachialis is 23% of the weight of the biceps brachii plus the coracobrachialis (47). To
exclude the coracobrachialis from the EF volume, the biceps brachii volume was reduced by 23% in all subjects. No data
are available for the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio in the anconeus, so it was assumed to be the same as the biceps
brachii because the fibers run parallel in both muscles ",1,"#2995 Klein 2001-Normalized force, activation, and coactivation in the arm muscles of young and old men.",2995,Klein 2001,"Normalized force, activation, and coactivation in the arm muscles of young and old men.",Canada,Cross sectional study,tension calculation method not accurate since force at distal arm was used as muscle force.,Klein CS; Rice CL; Marsh GD,2001,J Appl Physiol (1985),11509534,EF,Elbow Flexors,50/50,mixed,non-antigravity,elbow flexor,,Upper arm

A minimum of two
maximal voluntarily isometric leg extensions (MVCs) were performed on the chair of an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm; Cybex International, New York,
NY, USA) at 70, 80 and 90
 of knee flexion.  Each MVC lasted 2–3 s with a rest interval of 2 min between each contraction. Antagonist
muscle co-activation was estimated by determining the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the biceps femoris muscle during MVC. The interpolated twitch technique was used to determine the level of maximal voluntary QF muscle activation at 90
 of knee flexion. This level
of activation was applied to the MVC at optimum
angle, which, when corrected for antagonist muscle co-activation, provided true maximum torque (TMT). To calculate maximum QF muscle force recorded at the patellar tendon, it was necessary to divide TMT by the patellar tendon moment arm length (dPT).
Maximum patellar tendon
force (Ft) was thus calculated as TMT/dPT.","As the force generated by each component QF muscle would be reduced according to
the hp when resolved along the patellar tendon, each constituent muscle PCSA was multiplied by the cosine
of its respective hp to provide four reduced PCSAs.
Maximum patellar tendon force was subsequently divided by the sum of these reduced PCSAs to provide QF specific tension.

Biceps femoris muscle EMG activity was recorded during isometric knee flexion MVC at optimum joint angle (Kellis and Baltzopoulos 1997), and
the torque produced by the hamstrings during knee extension MVC was estimated assuming a linear relationship

as the length of the perpendicular line between the axis of the
patellar tendon and the TFCP (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006). This value

The muscle volume was calculated using contiguous axial ACSA scans taken from the tibiofemoral joint to the iliac crest. MRI slice thickness was set at 2.8 mm. 15 scans at 3.08 cm intervals.  
A spline curve was fitted to the ACSA data points associated with each of 4 component muscles and muscle volume was calculated as the area under the curve (Seynnes 2008)
","Ultrasound, measured during MVC, for each muscle.
Measurements of muscle fascicle length (Lf) and
pennation angle (hp) were performed on selected images
using digitizing software. 
Pennation angle was measured as the angle between the muscle fascicular paths and their insertion to the deep aponeurosis. 
Lf was measured by tracing the fascicle echo from origin to insertion on US image. If one end of fascicle extended beyond the end of the US image the Lf was estimated by extrapolating the superficial and lower aponeuroses as well as the fascicle.  In the case of the bi-
pennate RF muscle, only the lateral hp and Lf was analysed. 
he Lf and hp of each constituent muscle was
multiplied by the ratio of its respective volume to total QF
volume. The sum of these values represented the weighted
mean QF Lf and hp at optimum joint angle.","reduced QF PCSA= sum(PCSA)*cos alpha

The PCSA of each of the four constituent muscles of the
QF was calculated by dividing the component muscle
volume by its respective optimum Lf. The total RF volume
was divided by the lateral Lf. The complete QF PCSA was
given by the sum of the PCSAs of the four constituent
muscles","To calculate patellar tendon forces, the torque developed at
the knee must be divided by the patellar tendon moment
arm length (dPT). The procedure used to measure dPT has
been described elsewhere (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006).  Briefly,
dPT was quantified using a 0.2-T MRI scanner. PT was defined as
the length of the perpendicular line between the axis of the
patellar tendon and the TFCP (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006).
Previously reported values of dPT length at full extension
(0 knee flexion) and angles of 70, 80 and 90 knee flexion (Baltzopoulos 1995) were used to provide the necessary ratios with which to estimate dPT length at optimum knee
joint angle, i.e.
1. dPT 70/dPT 0 = 1.08
2. dPT 80/dPT 0 = 1.03
3. dPT 90/dPT 0 = 0.99
The appropriate ratio was applied to the dPT measured at
full extension to provide the estimated dPT at optimum joint
angle, which was subsequently multiplied by 1.14 to
account for a 14% increase in dPT from rest to MVC
(Tsaopoulos et al. 2007)

However, Chow et al. (1999) acknowledgedthat they had underestimated specific tension because of inaccurate estimates of fascicle pennation, failure to account for antagonist activation and the use of mean muscle force across a number of trials rather than maximal muscle force. Narici et al. (1992) and Reeves et al. (2004)did not account for the force that is lost in the transmission of quadriceps force through the patella to the tibia (Buffet al. 1988), and used F pt to calculate specific tension rather than Fquad. At the mean knee angle of 65 deg,this loss of force is equal to a third of Fquad. If the specific tension calculated in the present study had been calculated from the F pt, rather than Fquad, this would have resulted in estimates of ∼37 N cm−2, which are much closer to those previously reported. Additionally, in thepresent study F pt was calculated from PTMA lengthsmeasured at rest, which are smaller than those during contraction (Tsaopoulos et al. 2007).

Conversely, because FULL training increased both the FL and muscle volume (4.9 and 7.6% increase, respectively), the PCSA remained unchanged in the FULL group. Consequently, FULL training induced an increase in the VL specific tension (i.e., maximum muscle force per PCSA), as a result of a disproportionate increase in the fascicle force relative to the PCSA (29.7 and 2.5% increase, respectively). This discrepancy between the increase in muscle strength and size often reported follow-ing resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010) is commonly explained by the neural adaptations being greater than the muscle hypertrophy (Staron et al. 1994). However, the voluntary quadriceps muscle activation in the FULL group increased only 1.8% (nonsignificant, Table 4), which is quite similar to previous reports of increased muscle activa-tion after resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010; Reeves et al. 2004). Furthermore, although there was a trend toward decreases, there was no significant change in the level of antagonist muscle coactivation following training (− 16%, without statistical significance, Table 4). Therefore, correct-ing MVC for voluntary muscle activation, antagonist muscle coactivation and ⅆPT (which remained unchanged after train-ing) gave a 27.8% increase in the maximal quadriceps force (Table 4), thus demonstrating that training-induced changes in voluntary activation, coactivation and ⅆPT contributed little (4.2%) to the increase in MVC torque. Although we cannot deduce the source for the VL specific tension increase in the FULL group from the present results, some explanations have been presented as being able to cause the change in whole-muscle specific tension (Erskine et al. 2010). Among the factors that may explain this phenomenon are the increase in the number of thick myofilaments per unit area (packing density) (Pansarasa et al. 2009), a change in muscle fiber-type composition and/or preferential muscle fiber hypertrophy of type II fibers (Campos et al. 2002), and/or a possible change in the quality of attachment between the contractile muscle fibers and the surrounding connective tis-sue through which force is transmitted to tendons and bones (Erskine et al. 2010)",Valamatos MJ; Tavares F; Santos RM; Veloso AP; Mil-Homens P,2018,Eur J Appl Physiol,29982844,VL,Vastus Lateralis,Slow,monoarticular,antigravity,knee extensor,,Thigh

Muscle volume (cm3) was calculated
by multiplying the activated CSA (cm2) 
in each
slice x 2 cm (slice thickness + interslice space). The slices
were then added together to calculate the volume of acti-
vated tissue.","VL fiber length :muscle length ratio from lit.= 0.23

Adjustments were made to account for fiber length during isometric actions at different percentages of MVIT","[muscle volume * COS (pennation angle_VL)]/fiber length_VL

The PCSA of mQF was calculated as follows.
PCSA = [muscle volume x COS (pennation angle)]/

","lit value of patella moment arm=0.047m
 A moment arm length of
0.047 m was used to correct torque to force. Dividing the
torque by the moment arm provided the force applied by
the knee extensors to the tendon ","Force/ active PCSA

Specific tension was calculated by dividing the torque
(Nm) obtained for the Wrst contraction of the four different SNMES protocols by the patellar tendon moment
