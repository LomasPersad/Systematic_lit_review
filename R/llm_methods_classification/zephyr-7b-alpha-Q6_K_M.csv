To calculate the specific tension of the VL muscle in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: During MVCs, the torque generated by the VL muscle was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems Inc., Shirley, NY). The torque was recorded in Nm.
2. Calculation of muscle force: The force generated by the VL muscle was calculated by dividing the torque by the moment arm (MA) of the VL muscle (MA = 0.11 m). The force was recorded in N.
3. Measurement of PCSA: The PCSA of the VL muscle was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the optimum FL (measured at optimal angle during MVC). The muscle volume was measured using ultrasound imaging (Logiq E9, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). The optimum FL was measured during MVCs at the same site used for muscle architecture measurements. The PCSA was recorded in cm².
4. Calculation of specific tension: The specific tension of the VL muscle was calculated by dividing the VL fascicle force (calculated in step 2) by the VL PCSA (calculated in step 3). The specific tension was recorded in N/cm².
5. Statistical analysis: All statistics were calculated using the software pack SPSS 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Descriptive data were presented as the mean ± SD, unless otherwise stated. The assumption of normality was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test."	"

There are no weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension mentioned in the given context information. The calculation involves dividing the VL fascicle force by the VL PCSA (Maga-naris et al., 2001; Narici et al., 1992), which was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the optimum FL (measured at optimal angle during MVC). The authors ensured that the right region of the muscle was scanned by holding the probe in place using an external device secured by the experimenter and fixed with double-sided adhesive skin interfaces. The use of an echo-absorptive external marker ensured that no probe movement occurred in relation to the digitized structure. The statistical analyses were performed using the software pack SPSS 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). The assumption of normality was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Therefore, there are no weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension mentioned in the study's methodology."

To calculate specific tension using Method 1 in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The maximum voluntary torque (MVT) was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm, Medway, UK) at an angular velocity of 60°s?1. The torque was measured in Nm.
2. Calculation of patellar tendon force: The patellar tendon force (Ft) was calculated using the following formula:
Ft = (MVT × dPT × cos?) / Lf
where dPT is the patellar tendon moment arm (0.16 m), cos? is the cosine of the angle between the line of action of the quadriceps force and the patellar tendon moment arm (assumed to be 90°), and Lf is the optimum fascicle length (measured using ultrasound).
3. Calculation of QF PCSA: The PCSA of each of the four constituent muscles (VL, VLF, RF, and VM) was calculated using the following formula:
PCSA = (ACSA × Lm) / Lf
where ACSA is the cross-sectional area (measured using ultrasound), Lm is the muscle length (measured using ultrasound), and Lf is the optimum fascicle length (measured using ultrasound). The QF PCSA was calculated by summing the PCSA of each of the four constituent muscles.
4. Calculation of specific tension: Specific tension was calculated using the following formula:
Specific tension = (Ft × Lf) / QF PCSA
where Ft is the patellar tendon force (calculated in step 2), Lf is the optimum fascicle length (measured using ultrasound), and QF PCSA is the PCSA of the QF (calculated in step 3)."	"
The study acknowledges that ACSA underestimates the PCSA of pennate muscles and net joint torque does not give a true representation of the maximum force generated by the muscle. Therefore, ACSA and MVC may give a false indication of the muscle size-strength relationship and the nature of any training-induced changes (Kawakami et al., 1995). This highlights a weakness in the calculation of specific tension using ACSA and MVC measurements, as they may not accurately reflect the true muscle size-strength relationship."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The torque was measured using a custom-built dynamometer system. The torque was calculated by multiplying the force by the moment arm length.
2. Calculation of fascicle force: The fascicle force was calculated by subtracting the tendon force from the total force measured by the dynamometer system. The tendon force was calculated by multiplying the tendon force angle (cos?) by the tendon force measured by the dynamometer system.
3. Calculation of PCSA: The PCSA was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the optimal fascicle length. The muscle volume was calculated by multiplying the muscle length by the muscle width by the muscle depth. The optimal fascicle length was calculated by dividing the muscle length by the pennation angle (cos?).
4. Calculation of specific tension: Specific tension was calculated by dividing the fascicle force by the PCSA. The formula for specific tension is:
Speci?c tension = (tendon force × cos??1) / PCSA (3)
5. Incorporating size and architecture measurements: To minimize errors associated with distributing the tendon force between separate heads, the PCSA × cos? of the entire quadriceps muscle was calculated by summing the PCSA × cos? of each quadriceps head.
6. Calculation of specific tension for the entire quadriceps muscle: The specific tension for the entire quadriceps muscle was calculated by dividing the fascicle force by the PCSA × cos? of the entire quadriceps muscle."	"

The study by Morse et al. (2008) that calculated the specific tension of in vivo children's muscle using the PCSA made several assumptions in the calculation of muscle force. These assumptions were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context information, but the authors acknowledged and discussed them in their study. However, the weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study was not explicitly stated in the provided context information either. Therefore, it cannot be determined from the given context whether there were weaknesses in measuring muscle volume or force in this study."

To calculate specific tension (muscle force per CSA), we need to measure torque (?), force (F), and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). Here are the steps:
1. Calculate the moment arm (r) of the muscle being tested. This is the distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force being applied to the muscle.
2. Calculate the force (F) being applied to the muscle by dividing the measured torque (?) by the moment arm (r).
3. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle being tested by dividing the muscle volume (V) by the length of the muscle fibers (L).
4. Calculate the specific tension (ST) by dividing the force (F) by the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA).
5. Express the specific tension in Newtons per square centimeter (N/cm2) or Pascals (Pa).

For example:
Let's say we're testing the biceps brachii muscle in the elbow joint. The measured torque (?) is 20 Nm, the moment arm (r) is 5 cm, the muscle volume (V) is 1000 cm3, and the length of the muscle fibers (L) is 50 cm.
1. Calculate the force (F) being applied to the muscle: F = ? / r = 20 Nm / 5 cm = 4000 N (or 4 kN)
2. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle: PCSA = V / L = 1000 cm3 / (50 cm * ? * (1 cm / 2)2) = 10 cm2 (or 10000 mm2)
3. Calculate the specific tension (ST): ST = F / PCSA = 4000 N / 10 cm2 = 400 N/cm2 (or 400 kPa)

Note: The specific tension value obtained from this calculation may vary depending on the muscle being tested, the measurement techniques used, and other factors such as muscle fiber type and tendon stress/strain."	"

The study highlights a weakness in calculating specific tension due to the variability of PCSA values being so large that even if the correct value representing force per PCSA was known, a wide range of muscle force solutions would result depending on the muscle size chosen (6). This suggests that the assumption that a muscle's ability to generate force is directly proportional to its size may be tenuous indeed. Additionally, the study notes that obtaining values for architectural factors such as pennation angle of fibers, number of sarcomeres in series, fibre type, tendon stress and strain on living subjects to be applied to modeling situations is not currently possible. Therefore, assumptions must be made about these factors when estimating the force of a muscle. These assumptions may contribute to weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension."

To calculate specific tension (speci Wc), the following steps were taken:
1. During each maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and twitch-doublet, torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer.
2. The sum of the torque generated during the strongest MVC and that of the twitch-doublet was considered at the true maximal MVC and used for the calculation of speci Wc tension.
3. The PCSA (physiological cross-sectional area) of the gastrocnemius (GL) muscle was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the muscle length.
4. The relative PCSA of the GL within the triceps surae was calculated by dividing the PCSA of the GL by the total PCSA of the triceps surae muscle group.
5. The GL component of the Achilles tendon force was estimated by multiplying the relative PCSA of the GL by the total tendon force of the PF group.
6. Specific tension (speci Wc) was calculated by dividing the GL component of the Achilles tendon force by the PCSA of the GL muscle."	"

One weakness in calculating specific tension in this study is the normalization of strength to a single mid-muscle ACSA at 50% muscle length. This may lead to an overestimation of hypertrophy throughout the muscle and an underestimation of the MVC/ACSA. This is because the ACSA at 25% and 75% of the muscle length increased by smaller amounts (22% and 9%, respectively) compared to the ACSA at 50% muscle length (29%). Therefore, using a single mid-muscle ACSA to normalize strength may not accurately reflect the hypertrophy along the muscle's length."

To calculate specific tension (specific force) for the VL muscle in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Calculate the maximal voluntary torque (MVT) at the knee joint angle of 70° before and after training using an isokinetic dynamometer.
2. Calculate the H11001 superimposed stimulation torque (H11001 SIT) at the same knee joint angle of 70° before and after training using an isokinetic dynamometer with H11001 nerve stimulation.
3. Calculate the fascicle force (FF) at the knee joint angle of 70° before and after training by dividing the H11001 SIT by the number of active motor units (MUs) in the VL muscle. This calculation assumes that all MUs in the VL muscle are activated during H11001 SIT.
4. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the VL muscle using the formula: PCSA = muscle volume / fascicle length (assuming a muscle model that is cylindrical in shape with fibers of constant length).
5. Calculate the specific tension (specific force) of the VL muscle at the knee joint angle of 70° before and after training by dividing the FF by the PCSA.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the control group to compare the results with the training group."	"
The weakness in calculation of specific tension in previous attempts to assess alterations in specific force with strength training in elderly humans lies in errors in measuring muscle force and volume. Instead of measuring muscle force directly, joint torque or weight lifting capacity has been used, which does not accurately reflect only the agonist muscle forces (25). Furthermore, a single anatomic cross-sectional area (ACSA) has typically been used to normalize strength measurements to muscle size (44, 49), but this approach seems inappropriate because ACSA does not take into account muscle geometry and training-induced changes thereof (35), thus underestimating the PCSA of a pennate muscle (1, 16, 21). Additionally, a single ACSA is typically assessed in the midregion of a muscle, which has been reported as the region displaying the greatest increase in ACSA following training (46) and would thus lead to overestimation of hypertrophy."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps can be taken:
1. Measure the torque (TQ) produced by the muscle during a specific task (e.g., knee extension) using an isokinetic dynamometer.
2. Calculate the muscle force (F) by dividing the TQ by the moment arm (MA) of the joint (MA = distance from the joint axis to the line of action of the force).
3. Determine the muscle volume (MV) using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans.
4. Calculate the pennation angle (PA) of the muscle fibers by measuring the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of action of the force.
5. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle by dividing the MV by the PA (PCSA = MV/PA).
6. Calculate the specific tension (ST) by dividing the muscle force (F) by the PCSA (ST = F/PCSA).
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each muscle being studied to obtain specific tension values for each muscle.
8. Compare the specific tension values between different muscles or between different populations (e.g., elderly vs. young) to determine differences in muscle strength per size."	"

The study mentioned in the context information highlights the methodological differences in measuring muscle size, specifically the anatomical and physiological cross-sectional area (ACSA and PCSA) and muscle volume (MV). Theoretically, the specific tension of a muscle is determined by dividing muscle force (F) by PCSA. However, to calculate PCSA, MV, muscle fiber length, and fiber pennation angle must be determined, which can be challenging to measure in vivo, particularly in large population surveys. Therefore, some researchers have used joint torque per MV (TQ/MV) or muscle mass as an index of muscle strength per size. This idea is based on the assumption that the MV-TQ relationship is equivalent to the PCSA-F relationship if one assumes an identical muscle fiber/moment arm ratio for different individuals. However, weaknesses in calculating specific tension may exist due to assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume, which can affect the accuracy of the calculation."

To calculate specific tension, the following steps can be followed:
1. Measure the maximal torque (TMT) during an isometric contraction of the muscle group of interest.
2. Calculate the maximal force (Ft) resolved at the patellar tendon using the formula: Ft=TMT×d?1/PT, where d is the distance from the center of the patellar tendon to the center of the rotational axis of the joint (in this case, the knee joint), and PT is the patellar tendon length (in this case, the distance from the center of the patellar tendon to the center of the femoral condyles).
3. Determine the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle group of interest using a previously described method (Erskine et al., 2009). This involves measuring the femur length (FL) and the anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) of each component QF muscle using transverse MRI scans at 40% FL. The ACSA of each constituent QF muscle and a series of regression equations are used to estimate QF volume (Vm). The PCSA can then be calculated by dividing the Vm by the FL.
4. Calculate specific tension by dividing the maximal force (Ft) by the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA).

In this study, the sarcomere length was set at 2.6?m, and the ?bre CSA (fCSA) was determined while the ?bre was suspended in air, assuming a circular shape, and correction was made for swelling. Before maximal activation in a solution with pCa 4.5, the ?bre segment was transferred to a solution with less EGTA than the relaxingsolution for at least 30 s. The maximal isometric force (Po) was recorded, and ?bres were excluded if the force declined before reaching a plateau or if the sarcomere length had changed by >0.1?m. A total of 142 ?bres fulfilled these criteria (75 before and 67 ?bres after training)."	"

The study did not mention any weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension in terms of assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. However, it did mention that the determination of QF muscle specific tension from measurements of all four of the constituent muscles is time-consuming and difficult to use with large numbers of subjects. Therefore, the study used an alternative methodology that relies on measuring the anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) of the QF muscle, together with the fascicle length and pennation angle of the VL muscle to estimate whole-muscle specific tension in vivo. This methodology has been shown to be reliable in young, untrained, healthy men (Erskine et al., 2009). The study aimed to determine whether an expected increase in whole-muscle specific tension following resistance training could be explained by changes in muscle MyHC isoform composition and single-fiber specific tension or whether there is any evidence for a change in lateral force transmission."

To calculate specific tension for this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Calculate QF PCSA by dividing the estimated QF volume by VL Lf (Erskine et al., 2009). The CV and ICC for this measurement are 5.0% and 0.90 (0.70–0.97), respectively (Erskine et al., 2009).
2. Multiply QF PCSA by the cosine of the VL hp to provide the reduced QF PCSA (Erskine et al., 2009). This approximation of the hp for the whole QF muscle can be used since the force generated by the QF muscle is reduced according to the hpwhen resolved along the tendon.
3. Divide force by the reduced QF PCSA to provide QF specific tension (Erskine et al., 2009). The CV and ICC for this measurement are 9.1% and 0.69 (0.26–0.89), respectively (Erskine et al., 2009).
Note: In this study, muscle PCSA was calculated by dividing muscle volume by fascicle length (Alexander and Vernon, 1975; Haxton, 1944; Maganaris et al., 2001; Reeves et al., 2004), with the latter measured during MVC in the mid-sagittal plane of the central portion of the muscle."	"

The study acknowledges that certain assumptions were made in the calculation of in vivo muscle PCSA, which might have affected the estimation of specific tension. One of the assumptions made was that the muscle was cylindrical in shape and that its fascicles were a constant length. Previous in vivo and cadaveric findings support this assumption for human muscles. However, the lack of relationship between the changes in muscle force and PCSA after training could also be due to other factors that were not addressed in this study. Therefore, the weakness in the calculation of specific tension could be the potential inaccuracy in measuring muscle force and volume due to the assumptions made in this study."

To calculate specific tension for this study, the following steps need to be taken:
1. Measure the maximal isometric torque (Nm) using the strain gauge inserted in the cable and the photocells placed at 100"" and 110"" of elbow flexion (full extension of elbow joint = 180"").
2. Calculate the maximal isometric force (N) by multiplying the maximal isometric torque by the cosine of the angle of the lever arm (distance from elbow joint to handgrip) in radians (Nm/rad).
3. Calculate the cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle in the flexed position using the formula: PCSA = (0.038 m x 0.35 m) x (31% for m. biceps brachii + 30% for m. brachialis) x (1 + 0.34) x (1/11 for m. biceps brachii + 1/8 for m. brachialis) x (1/1000) (see context information for details).
4. Calculate the specific tension (N/cm2) by dividing the maximal isometric force by the PCSA (N/cm2)."	"
The calculation of specific tension in this study assumes a ratio of Ef (extrafusal) to Ei (intrafusal) fiber number for all subjects between the moment arm and the lever arm for both m. biceps brachii and m. brachialis. This ratio is based on the values reported by Edgerton et al. (1986) for young subjects, which may not be applicable to older subjects in this study. Additionally, the study assumes a 31% contribution to total force output by m. biceps brachii and a 30% contribution by m. brachialis (Edgerton et al., 1986), which may also vary between subjects. Furthermore, the study assumes an increase of 34% in the cross-sectional area in the flexed position for both m. biceps brachii and m. brachialis (Ikai & Fukunaga, 1968), which may not be accurate for all subjects in this study. These assumptions may introduce errors in the calculation of specific tension for m. biceps brachii and m. brachialis in this study."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps can be followed:
1. Measure the torque produced by the muscle during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) using a dynamometer.
2. Calculate the force produced by the muscle by dividing the torque by the moment arm (distance between the axis of rotation and the line of action of the force).
3. Measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the muscle using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans.
4. Calculate the pennation angle (PA) of the muscle fibers by measuring the angle between the muscle fibers and the line of force.
5. Calculate the pennated cross-sectional area (PCSA) by multiplying the CSA by the cosine of the PA.
6. Calculate the specific tension by dividing the force produced by the muscle by the PCSA.
7. Note that in this study, the authors acknowledge that the term ""specific tension"" is loosely applied based on pedal force, but if true specific tension in vivo is of interest, PCSA and tendon tension should be determined accurately."	"

One weakness in calculating specific tension in this study is the assumption that individual fibers in pennate muscle are oriented in true parallel to the long axis of the muscle. This assumption may not be accurate due to the angle of fiber pennation (from the long axis), which can result in less shortening force transferred to the tendon at the muscle's insertion than the total force generated by the fibers. Additionally, individual fibers do not span the entire length of the muscle, which can result in a CSA ""snap-shot"" that does not include all fibers contributing to the force. These limitations can affect the calculation of specific tension, which is the force per unit volume of muscle. To address these limitations, the study suggests using pennation-corrected cross-sectional area (PCSA) instead of cross-sectional area (ACSA) to better predict force capacity."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. During each maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), visual feedback was provided using an online graphical display, and constant verbal encouragement was provided by the investigator.
2. The sum of the torque generated during the strongest MVC and that of the twitch-doublet was considered at the true maximal MVC for the calculation of specific tension.
3. The value of torque calculated with this method probably represents a peak MVC and not the true maximal MVC as would have been obtained by adding a tetanus rather than doublet to the voluntary torque. However, considering that the delivery of a tetanic current is extremely painful and that the population studied included older individuals, the investigators opted to use a doublet instead.
4. To estimate the contribution of the gastrocnemii (GL) to Achilles tendon force, the relative PCSA of the GL within the triceps surae (TS) was calculated. The method of estimating the relative contribution of each constituent muscle to the total tendon force component from relative PCSA of each constituent of a muscle group has been previously reported (35). By using the same procedure, it was possible to estimate the GL component of Achilles tendon force from the ratio of GL PCSA to the total PCSA of the TS multiplied by the total tendon force of the PF group.
5. Achilles tendon force was calculated by dividing PF peak torque by the Achilles tendon moment arm length (Fig. 3).
6. Specific tension was calculated by dividing the estimated GL component of Achilles tendon force by the GL PCSA. This value represents the force generated per unit of GL cross-sectional area during the MVC."	"
The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study lies in the fact that muscle force and volume measurements were obtained in vivo, but the calculation of PCSA (physiological cross-sectional area) was estimated by combining fiber length and pennation based on cadaveric data. This approach may lead to errors in the estimation of PCSA due to the alterations in muscle architecture in the elderly and the shrinkage of cadaveric muscles during fixation. Therefore, the use of architectural data obtained from cadavers may not accurately reflect the in vivo PCSA of the muscles being compared between the young and elderly populations."

To calculate the specific tension of the plantar flexors in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The torque was measured using a strain gauge dynamometer (Model 3100A, Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN) with the subject seated in a chair with the ankle joint at 90 degrees of flexion. The subject was instructed to plantar flex the ankle joint against the resistance of the dynamometer. The torque was calculated by multiplying the force (in Newtons) by the distance between the axis of rotation (the ankle joint) and the line of action of the force (the Achilles tendon) (in meters).
2. Measurement of force: The force was measured using the same strain gauge dynamometer. The force was calculated by dividing the voltage output of the dynamometer by the calibration factor (in Newtons per volt).
3. Calculation of PCSA: The PCSA was calculated for each muscle using the following formula: PCSA = muscle volume X cos e/fiber length, where e is the angle of muscle fiber pinnation in one dimension (8 degrees in this study) and f is the fiber length (in meters). The muscle volume was calculated by multiplying the muscle length (in meters) by the muscle width (in meters) by the muscle depth (in meters). The muscle width and depth were measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
4. Calculation of specific tension: The specific tension was calculated by dividing the torque (in Newtons-meters) by the PCSA (in square centimeters). The specific tension was calculated for the total plantar flexors (gastrocnemii and soleus) and for the triceps surae (gastrocnemii and soleus excluding the plantaris muscle).
5. Comparison with previous studies: The specific tension values obtained in this study were compared with those obtained in previous studies using the same methodology (calculation based on PCSA) and with those obtained using different methodologies (calculation based on ACSA). The results showed that the specific tension values obtained in this study were considerably lower than those obtained in previous studies using the same methodology (calculation based on PCSA), but were similar to those obtained in previous studies using different methodologies (calculation based on ACSA)."	"
The weakness in calculating specific tension in previous studies lies in the imprecise estimation of crucial variables that affect the maximum in vivo force potential per unit PCSA in humans. These variables include joint design, maximum torques, moment arms, muscle masses, muscle fiber lengths, angles of fiber pinnation, and the ""in series"" and ""in parallel"" arrangements of these fibers. The indirectness of some of the measures used to calculate human in vivo force potential is apparent. For example, anatomic cross-sectional area (ACSA), muscle volume, fiber length, angle of fiber pinnation, and moment arm measurements of human muscles based on cadavers have been used to compare the torque potential in human subjects (4, 11, 44). However, these measurements may not accurately reflect the in vivo conditions due to factors such as muscle activation, joint angle, and muscle length changes during contraction. Additionally, the ""in series"" and ""in parallel"" arrangements of muscle fibers may vary between individuals and may affect the specific tension calculation. Therefore, more accurate in vivo measurements using improved imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography, and ultra-sound may provide more reliable data for calculating specific tension in humans."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Calculate the GL component of tendon force (Ft) by subtracting the soleus component of tendon force (Fs) from the total tendon force (Ftot) measured during plantarflexion:
Ft = Ftot - Fs
2. Calculate the pennation angle (?) during contraction using ultrasound imaging.
3. Calculate the cosine of the pennation angle (cos?) to determine the fascicle length (L) during contraction:
L = L0 * cos?
4. Calculate the fascicle force (Ff) by dividing the GL component of tendon force (Ft) by the cosine of the pennation angle (cos?):
Ff = Ft / cos?
5. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the gastrocnemius muscle by multiplying the muscle thickness (t) by the muscle width (w) and the number of pennations (n):
PCSA = t * w * n
6. Calculate specific tension by dividing the fascicle force (Ff) by the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA):
Specific tension = Ff / PCSA
7. Normalize the GL component of plantarflexor torque to GL ACSA by dividing the GL component of plantarflexor torque (MVC/ACSA) by the GL ACSA:
Normalized torque = MVC/ACSA / GL ACSA
8. Statistical analysis was performed using independent samples Student's t-tests to compare differences between groups. Distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and homogeneity of variance was assessed using the Levene test. The level of significance was set at the 5% level. Results are presented as means ± SD."	"
The calculation of specific force in prepubertal populations requires a number of assumptions to be made based on data from adults (e.g., relative PCSA, in vivo length-tension relations, and moment arm lengths at MVC), which have yet to be con?rmed experimentally. This highlights a weakness in the calculation of specific tension in this study, as it relies on assumptions based on data from adults rather than direct measurements in prepubertal populations."

To calculate specific tension (specific force) in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, NY) at an angular velocity of 60°/s. The torque was recorded during the MVC of the quadriceps muscle group.
2. Calculation of moment arm: The moment arm was calculated by measuring the distance between the center of rotation (the axis of the dynamometer) and the line of action of the quadriceps muscle group (the center of the patella). The moment arm was measured using anatomical landmarks and a tape measure.
3. Calculation of PCSA: The PCSA was calculated by measuring the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the quadriceps muscle group at the midpoint of the thigh using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The CSA was calculated by tracing the muscle fibers on the MRI image using image analysis software (Image J). The PCSA was calculated by multiplying the CSA by the length of the muscle fibers (measured using ultrasound).
4. Calculation of pennation angle: The pennation angle was calculated by measuring the angle at which the muscle fibers intercepted the deep aponeurosis using ultrasound. The pennation angle was measured at the midpoint of the thigh.
5. Calculation of specific tension: Specific tension was calculated by dividing the torque by the product of the PCSA and the cosine of the pennation angle (to account for the reduction in transmission of forces from fibers to aponeurosis due to the angle between the fascicles and the line of pull through the patella tendon). Specific tension was simplified to patella tendon force divided by the product of the PCSA and the pennation angle (26). The external force used in the calculation of specific tension was the ""true MVC,"" which was calculated by dividing the MVC immediately prior to the superimposed doublet by (1 - t/T), where t was the amplitude of the superimposed doublet and T was the value of the doublet applied to the resting muscle 1 s prior to MVC."	"

The study did not specifically mention weaknesses in calculating specific tension, but it did acknowledge that the force/ACSA gives a very similar age-related difference as the more comprehensively measured in situ specific force. However, the study did note that the lower PCSA in old was mainly due to a change in muscle volume because the fascicle length was similar for old and young and age-dependent differences in pennation angle have minimal influence on force transmission to the tendon. Therefore, the study's method for measuring muscle volume may have an impact on the calculation of specific tension. Additionally, the study did not mention any assumptions in measuring muscle force, but it did note that the moment arm and voluntary activation did not differ between young and old, which may have influenced the calculation of specific tension."

To calculate specific tension (ST), the following steps were taken:
1. Calculate maximal tendon force by correcting knee extension moment (MVT) for antagonist torque. This was done by normalizing HEMG at knee extensor MVT to HEMG MAX (i.e., at KF MVT) and multiplying by KF MVT to provide torque from the knee extensors only (66).
2. Divide the knee extensor muscle torque by corrected PTMA (see above) to obtain muscle force.
3. Calculate quadriceps effective PCSA (Q EFFPCSA) by multiplying PCSA by cosine of mean /H9008P(28) and summing the four constituent muscles.
4. Divide muscle force by Q EFFPCSA to obtain specific tension (ST)."	"

There is no weakness in the calculation of specific tension in this study. The authors used corrected PTMA to calculate ST, which involves dividing muscle force by Q EFFPCSA to obtain specific tension. The measurement of muscle force was performed during duplicate laboratory sessions to produce criterion values for statistical analysis. The measurement of muscle volume was also performed using established methods, and the authors did not report any assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. Therefore, there is no weakness in the calculation of specific tension in this study."

To calculate specific tension (N/cm2), the following steps can be followed:
1. Measure the torque (Nm) produced by the muscle during an isometric contraction using a dynamometer.
2. Calculate the force (N) produced by the muscle by dividing the torque by the moment arm (cm) of the muscle.
3. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle by dividing the muscle volume (cm3) by the estimated muscle fiber length (cm) and the cosine of the pennation angle (rad). The muscle volume can be calculated by summing the cross-sectional area (cm2) of all slices of the muscle along its length (7 mm thickness). The muscle length can be measured from MRI images. The pennation angle can be estimated from cadaveric data (38).
4. Calculate the specific tension (N/cm2) by dividing the force (N) by the PCSA (cm2).
In this study, the PCSA was calculated using the formula: PCSA = (muscle volume/estimated muscle fiber length) * cosine of the pennation angle. The estimated muscle fiber length was calculated by multiplying the muscle length (from MRI) by the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio determined in cadavers (38). The ratios used were 0.60, 0.49, 0.68, and 0.33 for the biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii, respectively (38). It was assumed that the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio was the same in the young and old men because no studies have determined whether fiber length changes with age."	"
The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study may be due to the fact that the pronator teres and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles, which can function as elbow flexors, were not included in the EF volume. Consequently, NF of the EFs was likely overestimated by ;15% in the present study (38). Additionally, the anatomic cross-sectional area (ACSA), which is the area of muscle measured from a single cross section, may underestimate the loss of muscle mass with age (2). A more accurate index of muscle size and force-generating capacity, particularly in muscles with a pennate ?ber architec-ture such as the triceps brachii, may be the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) (12, 42)."

To calculate specific tension (Si), we first measured the torque (Po) generated by each muscle during intraoperative testing using a custom-built force transducer (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Ontario, Canada). The force generated by each muscle was calculated by dividing the measured torque by the moment arm length (r) of the muscle being tested (Po = F × r). The physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of each muscle was calculated using standard equations (Lieber & Friden, 2000), where muscle volume was obtained optically for each muscle as described above and fibre length was estimated for each muscle based on the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of their muscle length–tension curve determined intraoperatively. Specific tension (Si) was then calculated by dividing the force generated by each muscle (F) by its PCSA (PCSA). The formula for specific tension calculation is:

Si = F / PCSA

where F is the force generated by each muscle (N) and PCSA is the physiological cross-sectional area of each muscle (cm2)."	"
The calculation of specific tension in this study involves several assumptions that may weaken the accuracy of the measurement. Firstly, the transformation of joint torque into muscle force requires assumptions that may not be valid for all muscles. Secondly, the transformation of whole muscle force into specific tension involves additional assumptions that may also affect the accuracy of the measurement. These assumptions include the calculation of muscle volume, which can be challenging to measure accurately in vivo. The study acknowledges these limitations and uses a minimum set of assumptions to calculate gracilis specific tension, resulting in an estimate of 171 ±84 kPa. However, this value is lower than that reported for most small mammalian muscles, which may suggest that specific tension varies widely across different muscle types."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps can be taken:
1. Measure the torque (Nm) produced by the gastrocnemius muscle during contraction using an isokinetic dynamometer.
2. Calculate the force (N) produced by the muscle by dividing the torque by the moment arm (m) of the dynamometer.
3. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscle using the following formula:
   PCSA = (muscle area in cm2) / (muscle thickness in cm)
   where muscle area can be calculated by measuring the muscle's width (cm) and length (cm) using ultrasound imaging, and muscle thickness can be calculated by subtracting the distance between the tendons from the distance between the skin surface and the deepest point of the muscle.
4. Calculate the specific tension (N/cm2) by dividing the force (N) by the PCSA (cm2).
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each level of joint angle and contraction intensity to obtain specific tension values for different conditions."	"
The study highlights potential weaknesses in calculating specific tension in human muscles. Firstly, the authors suggest that the variance in specific tension among different human muscle groups may reflect an imperfect transmission of force by any given muscle fiber to the tendon due to the interfiber matrix of the muscle. This implies that when strength testing involves several muscles acting at a joint angle, activation at a specific joint angle may not be maximal for all of them. Secondly, vanZuylen et al. (1988) have observed that the relative activation of muscles varies with elbow angle in human arm muscles. Changing joint angle affected the mechanical advantage of the elbow flexor and extensor muscles differently, with those muscles having the greater mechanical advantage at a specific angle receiving the larger neural input. A similar mechanism could also exist for the human plantarflexors. Finally, the study shows that at rest, PCSA considerably increases with joint angle, which could potentially lead to an overestimation of specific tension if the joint angles of PCSA and force measurements do not coincide. Therefore, the study highlights the importance of considering joint angle when measuring muscle force and volume to accurately calculate specific tension in human muscles."

To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Elbow flexion/extension torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer.
2. The force at the tendons was calculated from the torque and moment arms of muscles measured by MRI.
3. Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was calculated from the muscle volume and muscle fibre length. The muscle volume was obtained from the series ACSA (area of the cross-section of the muscle). The muscle fibre length was calculated from the muscle length multiplied by previously reported fibre/muscle length ratios.
4. Specific tension was calculated by dividing the force at the tendons by the PCSA of the muscle being measured. This calculation provides an indication of the capacity of tension development for that muscle.
5. The specific tension was related to the estimated velocity of muscle fibres to determine if the capacity of tension development was analogous between elbow flexors and extensors."	"

One potential weakness in calculating specific tension in this study could be the assumption made in measuring muscle force. The study relies on the measurement of torque using a dynamometer to determine the resultant modified joint moment. However, the conversion of torque to muscle force may involve assumptions about the lever arm length and the angle of the joint during the measurement. These assumptions could introduce errors in the calculation of specific tension, particularly if the joint angle varies during the measurement or if the lever arm length is not accurately known. Additionally, the study relies on previous studies that measured muscle volumes and fiber lengths by direct dissection of human cadaver specimens. While this method provides accurate measurements, it may introduce variability due to factors such as shrinkage in the embalmed cadavers (Friedrich and Brand 1990). This variability could affect the calculation of specific tension by altering the PCSA used in the calculation. Overall, while the study provides valuable insights into the specific tension of elbow flexor and extensor muscles, the assumptions made in measuring muscle force and volume should be considered when interpreting the results."

Step 1: Measurement of Joint Moment
Subjects were securely ?xed in the prone position on an
isokinetic dynamometer (Lido Active, Loredan Biomedical,Davis, CA), with the knee of the tested leg ?exed at 60° (Fig.1). The dynamometer was set to an angular velocity of 60°/s, and the subjects were asked to perform an MVC of knee extension against the dynamometer. The peak torque (Nm) was recorded for each subject.
Step 2: Measurement of Moment Arm Length
The moment arm length (L) was calculated as the perpendicular distance between the line of action of the force (the line of action of the tendon) and the axis of rotation (the knee joint) (Fig.1). L was measured using a goniometer (Staedtler, Nürnberg, Germany) with the subjects in the same position as for the MVC (i.e., prone with the knee flexed at 60°). The moment arm length was measured at the midpoint of the muscle belly (i.e., midway between the origin and insertion of the muscle).
Step 3: Calculation of Tendon Force
The tendon force (Ft) was calculated by dividing the peak torque (Nm) by the moment arm length (L) (Eq.1).
Ft = peak torque / moment arm length (Eq.1)

Step 4: Measurement of Fascicular Length and Pennation Angle
The fascicular length (Lf) was measured using ultrasound (Acuson Sequoia 512, Mountain View, CA) with the subjects in the same position as for the MVC (i.e., prone with the knee flexed at 60°). The pennation angle (?) was calculated as the angle between the fascicles and the line of action of the force (i.e., the line of action of the tendon) (Fig.1). The fascicular length and pennation angle were measured at the midpoint of the muscle belly (i.e., midway between the origin and insertion of the muscle).
Step 5: Calculation of Muscle Force
The muscle force (Fm) was calculated by dividing the tendon force (Ft) by the cosine of the pennation angle (?) (Eq.2).
Fm = Ft / cos(?) (Eq.2)

Step 6: Measurement of Muscle Volume
The muscle volume (Vm) was calculated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (GE Signa Excite HDxt, Milwaukee, WI) with the subjects in the supine position (i.e., lying on their back). The MRI scans were obtained at the midpoint of the muscle belly (i.e., midway between the origin and insertion of the muscle). The muscle volume was calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder (Eq.3).
Vm = (?/4) × (diameter)2 × length (Eq.3)

Step 7: Calculation of PCSA
Estimations of PCSA were obtained from the ratio of muscle volume to fascicular length (Eq.4).
PCSA = (Vm / Lf) × cos(?) (Eq.4)

Step 8: Calculation of Speci?c Tension
Speci?c tension was estimated and compared from the ratio of muscle force to PCSA using two data sets. First, muscle moments during electrical stimulation and in vivo moment arm lengths, fascicular lengths, and pennation angles during MVC were taken into account (data set A). After this traditional approach, muscle stress was calculated using net MVC joint moments, moment arm lengths at rest, and cadaveric fascicular lengths and pennation angles (data set B).
Speci?c tension = (Fm / PCSA) (Eq.5)

Note: In this study, the authors used two data sets to calculate specific tension: data set A (in vivo) and data set B (cadaveric). The calculation of specific tension using data set A involved measuring muscle moments during electrical stimulation and in vivo moment arm lengths, fascicular lengths, and pennation angles during MVC. The calculation of specific tension using data set B involved measuring net MVC joint moments, moment arm lengths at rest, and cadaveric fascicular lengths and pennation angles."	"
One limitation in calculating specific tension in this study is the potential for underestimation of the actual moment-generating potential of TA and Sol due to failure to activate all motoneurons during stimulation. This limitation arises from the fact that Sol is proximally covered by gastrocnemius, which may result in incomplete activation of the muscle during stimulation. Additionally, the moment measurements may underestimate the actual moment-generating potential of TA and Sol due to the fact that the measurements may not account for the inactive muscle portion size during stimulation. However, T2-weighted MRI offers the possibility for measurements of the inactive muscle portion size during stimulation, from which appropriate corrections in the calculations of muscle volume, PCSA, and specific tension could be made (1)."

The specific tension of the brachial biceps muscle was calculated using three steps:
1) Contribution of the brachial biceps muscle to MVC in elbow flexion: According to Hansen & Lindhard (1923), the brachial biceps muscle contributes 34.92% to MVC in elbow flexion. This value was used to determine the force generated by the brachial biceps muscle during the experiment.
2) Ratio of ""force arm"" to ""resistance arm"": The ""force arm"" is the distance from the center of axis of rotation of the elbow joint at the condylus humeri to the point at which the brachial biceps muscle attaches to the tuberositas radii (Wilkie, 1950). The ""resistance arm"" is the distance from the condylus humeri to the handgrip. The ratio of ""force arm"" to ""resistance arm"" is 1:7. This ratio was used to calculate the force generated by the brachial biceps muscle during the experiment.
3) Increase of cross-sectional area of the flexed arm: According to Ikai & Fukunaga (1968), the cross-sectional area of the flexed arm increases by 34%. This value was used to calculate the cross-sectional area of the brachial biceps muscle during the experiment.
To calculate specific tension, the following formula was used:
Specific tension = (force generated by the brachial biceps muscle during the experiment) / (cross-sectional area of the brachial biceps muscle during the experiment)

In this study, the force generated by the brachial biceps muscle during the experiment was calculated using the force registered through a strain gauge inserted in the cable. The cross-sectional area of the brachial biceps muscle during the experiment was calculated using the increase of cross-sectional area of the flexed arm (34%) and the cross-sectional area of the brachial biceps muscle at rest (measured using anatomical dissection). The specific tension was then calculated using the formula provided above."	"
The calculation of specific tension in the study by Ikai & Fukunaga (1968) may have weaknesses in measuring muscle force or volume due to the fact that the pronator teres, extensor carpi radialis longus, and brachioradialis muscles contribute approximately 30% to total force output in elbow flexion (Hansen & Lindhard 1923, Wilkie 1950, Jgrgensen & Bankow 1971). This means that the specific tension of the elbow flexors of the upper arm in the study by Ikai & Fukunaga (1968) will be reduced to 33 N/cm2 when considering the contribution of these other muscles to the total force output. However, the study by Haxton (1944) measured the absolute strength of calf muscles to be 39 N/cm2, which may also have weaknesses in measuring muscle force due to the fact that all motor units may not have been activated in isometric force development (Gydikov & Kosarov 1974). Additionally, the present findings on subjects with widely varying distributions of muscle fibre types indicate that the specific tension that can be produced by slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibres may be similar (Nygaard 1983), but this may also have weaknesses in measuring muscle volume due to the fact that the relative volume of muscle fibre types may not accurately reflect the actual volume of muscle fibres in the brachial biceps muscle."

To calculate specific tension (F/CSA phys) in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of maximal knee extension moment (Mx) was obtained using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm).
2. The moment arm for the patella tendon was assumed to be 4.0 cm (Wickiewicz et al., 1984; Marshall et al., 1990).
3. The ratio of patella tendon force to quadriceps tendon force at 70 degrees knee flexion was assumed to be 0.70 (Nisell et al., 1989).
4. Quadriceps force (Fquad) was estimated from the measurement of Mx using the above assumptions.
5. The muscle volume (V) was obtained experimentally for each participant.
6. The pennation angle (PA) was also obtained experimentally for each participant.
7. The total muscle fibre force (Ffibres) was calculated using the formula Fquad/cos(PA).
8. The total muscle fibre area (CSA phys) was calculated using the formula CSA phys = (V/L) * PA * cos(PA), where L is the muscle length (assumed to be 7 cm).
9. Specific tension (F/CSA phys) was calculated by dividing Fquad/cos(PA) by CSA phys.
10. The values of specific tension before and after the period of strength training were calculated using the above steps for each participant, and the mean values were reported for the group."	"

The calculation of specific tension (F/CSA phys) in this study has limitations in measuring muscle force and volume. While the maximal isometric quadriceps strength (MVC) before and after training can be measured, it is difficult to provide a precise measure of the total physiological muscle fibre area (CSA phys) of pennate muscle in vivo. Therefore, an estimate of CSA phys can be obtained by combining data from the present and previous studies. However, this method assumes that the relative proportion of non-contractile tissue remains unchanged in response to resistance training (Mikesky et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1993; Roman et al., 1993). This assumption may not always be true, as previous studies have shown that resistance training can lead to an increase in non-contractile tissue (Hoffman et al., 2002; Schoenfeld et al., 2010). Therefore, the calculation of specific tension may be affected by the accuracy of measuring muscle force and volume, as well as the assumption that non-contractile tissue remains unchanged in response to training."

To calculate specific tension (N/cm2), we need to first calculate specific force (N/cm2) using the formula:
specific force = (torque / moment arm length) / PCSA
where torque (Nm) is the product of force (N) and moment arm length (m), and PCSA (cm2) is the physiological cross-sectional area of the muscle being studied.
In this study, torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3) at an angular velocity of 60 degrees per second (during the knee extension phase). The force applied to the leg was measured using a load cell (ATI G-29N) attached to the dynamometer. The moment arm length was calculated using DEXA scanning (Hologic Discovery) at the angle acquired from optimal peak force production using a manual goniometer. The PCSA was estimated using the formula: PCSA = (muscle volume / fascicle length) assuming the model used to calculate muscle volume is cylindrical and that the muscle fibers are of constant length.
To calculate specific tension, we need to divide specific force by muscle fiber length (cm) to get specific tension (N/cm2). However, in this study, the authors did not provide the muscle fiber length measurement. Therefore, specific tension cannot be calculated directly from the provided data."	"
The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study lies in the assumption that the measurement of muscle volume accurately reflects the actual muscle volume. B-mode ultrasonography was used to obtain a 50% muscle-length transverse measurement of VL ACSA, which may include noncontractile material in the measurement of muscle mass (50). This could potentially lead to an overestimation of muscle area and subsequently an underestimation of specific force. Additionally, the measurement of agonist and antagonist muscle activation may also be a weakness in calculating specific force, as the ratio of KF iMVC /H9270 and KE iMVC /H9270 was calculated to describe a balance of quadriceps to hamstring strength (30, 50). However, this assumes that the measurement of KE iMVC /H9270 accurately reflects the actual agonist muscle activation during the measurement of net KE iMVC /H9270."

To calculate the specific tension (stress) of each muscle in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque (T) at the ankle joint was obtained using a dynamometer (Narici et al., 1992).
2. The force (F) acting along the tendon (Ft) was calculated by dividing the torque by the moment arm (Rp~) (Eq. 1).
3. The force acting along the fibers (Ff) was calculated by dividing the force acting along the tendon (Ft) by the cosine of the pennation angle (0) (Eq. 2).
4. The cross-sectional area of the entire quadriceps (CSAp) was calculated by summing the cross-sectional area of each muscle (VL, VI, VM, RF) (Eq. 3).
5. The specific tension (stress) of each muscle was calculated by dividing the force acting along the fibers (Ff) by the cross-sectional area of each muscle (Eq. 4).

Eq. 1: Torque (T) = Force (F) x Moment Arm (Rp~)
Eq. 2: Force acting along the fibers (Ff) = Force acting along the tendon (Ft) / Cosine of the pennation angle (0)
Eq. 3: Cross-sectional area of the entire quadriceps (CSAp) = Sum of the cross-sectional area of each muscle (VL, VI, VM, RF)
Eq. 4: Specific tension (stress) = Force acting along the fibers (Ff) / Cross-sectional area of each muscle (CSAp)"	"
The weakness in calculation of specific tension in this study arises from the use of anatomical CSA instead of physiological CSA in the evaluation of muscle stress. This potential error arises from the fact that the anatomical CSA may not correspond to the physiological CSA in pennate muscles, where fibres lie at an angle with respect to the axis of traction of the muscle. This can lead to an incorrect use of muscle CSA and biomechanical factors that contribute to discrepancies in stress values calculated for human muscle compared to animal muscle. The only human stress data that agree with those of animal muscle either refer to parallel-fibred muscles or to CSAp measured on cadavers. Therefore, the use of anatomical CSA in the evaluation of muscle stress may lead to potential errors in the calculation of specific tension."

To calculate specific tension (Wc tension) in N/cm2 for this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measure the torque (Nm) produced by the knee extensors during the electrical stimulation of the quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle group.
2. Calculate the moment arm (cm) of the knee extensors by measuring the distance between the center of the knee joint and the line of action of the quadriceps tendon (Reeves et al., 2004).
3. Divide the torque by the moment arm to obtain the force (N) applied by the knee extensors to the tendon (Reeves et al., 2004).
4. Calculate the PCSA (cm2) of activated quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle by multiplying the activated CSA (cm2) in each slice by 2 cm (slice thickness + interslice space), adding the slices together to calculate the volume of activated tissue, and dividing by the pennation angle (15.6°) of m. vastus lateralis at 60° of knee joint below horizontal during isometric contraction (Fukunaga et al., 1997; Ichinose et al., 1997).
5. Divide the force (N) by the PCSA (cm2) to obtain the specific tension (Wc tension) in N/cm2."	"

In this study, the calculation of specific tension involves dividing the force applied by the knee extensors to the tendon by the PCSA of activated skeletal muscle. The weakness in this calculation lies in the assumptions made in measuring muscle force and volume. The force applied by the knee extensors to the tendon may be affected by factors such as the position of the joint, the type of stimulation used, and the duration of the contraction. These factors can lead to variations in the force output and affect the accuracy of the specific tension measurement. Additionally, the calculation of muscle volume involves multiplying the activated CSA in each slice by the slice thickness and interslice space, which can be subject to errors due to variations in slice thickness and interslice space. Furthermore, the pennation angle used in the calculation of PCSA may also be affected by factors such as the position of the joint and the type of stimulation used. These factors can lead to variations in the pennation angle and affect the accuracy of the PCSA measurement. Overall, the calculation of specific tension in this study involves several assumptions that can affect the accuracy of the measurement."

To calculate specific tension for VL in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm). The subjects performed knee extension at an angular velocity of 60°/s for 3 sets of 10 repetitions at each load level (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of their 1-RM). The peak torque (PT) was recorded for each repetition at each load level.
2. Calculation of force: The force (Fm) was calculated by dividing the peak torque (PT) by the moment arm (MA) of the knee extensor (MA = 0.17 m).
3. Calculation of physiological CSA: The physiological CSA (PCSA) of VL was calculated by multiplying the average CSA at the three positions (mid-quadriceps, mid-patella, and mid-tendon) by the pennation angle (PA) of VL (PA = 25°). The average CSA at the three positions was calculated as representative of tendon CSA (Reeves et al., 2003).
4. Calculation of fascicle force: The fascicle force (Ff) of VL was calculated by the following equation: Ff = Fm · cos P–1
where cos P is the cosine of the angle of pennation of VL.
5. Calculation of specific tension: Specific tension of VL was calculated by dividing fascicle force by physiological CSA (e.g., Reeves et al., 2004)."	"

In this study, the calculation of specific tension was valid for studying the changes of specific tension after training because the fascicle length during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) did not change after training (Table 1). However, there may be weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension due to assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume. For instance, the measurement of muscle volume may involve summing the anatomical cross-sectional area (CSA) of each image times the thickness (10 mm), but this may not accurately represent the true muscle volume due to variations in muscle fiber orientation and the presence of connective tissue. Additionally, the measurement of fascicle force may involve calculating the force by multiplying the muscle force by the cosine of the angle of pennation of the muscle, but this assumes that the force is evenly distributed across the fascicles, which may not be the case in reality. Despite these potential weaknesses, the present study aimed to examine the influences of low-load and high-load resistance training on neuromuscular and tendon properties rather than the ""accurate"" specific tension."
2680	"
To calculate specific tension in this study, the following steps were taken:
1. Measurement of torque: The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Cybex Norm, Stoughton, MA) at an angular velocity of 60°/s. The MVC torque was recorded for each leg at the optimum knee joint angle (120° of knee flexion) for each participant.
2. Measurement of force: The maximum patellar tendon force was measured using a force transducer (Noraxon, AZ) attached to the patellar tendon via a custom-made strap. The force transducer was connected to an amplifier (Noraxon, AZ) and then to a computer for data collection (PowerLab, ADInstruments, NSW, Australia). The maximum patellar tendon force was recorded for each leg during the MVC at the optimum knee joint angle for each participant.
3. Calculation of PCSA: The quadriceps femoris (QF) PCSA was calculated using the method described by Erskine et al. (2009). The QF was divided into four constituent muscles: vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), and vastus intermedius (VI). The PCSA of each constituent muscle was calculated using the following formula:
PCSA = (muscle volume × muscle density) / bone-free muscle length
where muscle volume was calculated using the formula:
muscle volume = (0.001 × muscle area × muscle thickness) × bone-free muscle length
and muscle density was assumed to be 1060 kg/m³ (Hawkins & Sprigings, 1992). The muscle area was measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (1.5 T, Signa Excite, GE Medical Systems, WI) at the mid-point of the femur (Erskine et al., 2009). The bone-free muscle length was calculated using the formula:
bone-free muscle length = (muscle length - patella tendon length) - (bone length × cosine of the angle between the bone and the muscle)
where muscle length was measured using MRI (Erskine et al., 2009). The patella tendon length was measured using ultrasound (Logiq 9, GE Medical Systems, WI) (Erskine et al., 2009). The bone length was measured using MRI (Erskine et al., 2009). The angle between the bone and the muscle was measured using MRI (Erskine et al., 2009).
4. Calculation of reduced PCSAs: As the force generated by each constituent QF muscle would be reduced according to the angle between the muscle and the patellar tendon (Erskine et al., 2009), each constituent muscle PCSA was multiplied by the cosine of its respective angle to provide four reduced PCSAs.
5. Calculation of specific tension: Maximum patellar tendon force was subsequently divided by the sum of these reduced PCSAs to provide QF specific tension (Erskine et al., 2009).
6. Statistics: The test-retest reliability (coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient) of all the measurements used to calculate in vivo QF specific tension has been reported previously (Erskine et al., 2009). Paired samples Student's t-tests were used to investigate pre- to post-training differences in MVC torque, voluntary muscle activation, antagonist muscle co-activation, optimum knee joint angle, patellar tendon moment arm length, maximum patellar tendon force, total QF volume, and total QF PCSA."	"

One weakness in calculating specific tension in this study could be the assumption that the measured muscle force accurately reflects the force generated by the entire muscle. This may not be the case due to factors such as the presence of non-contractile elements in the muscle, the influence of neural factors on force production, and the potential for muscle force to vary during the course of an exercise bout (Moritani et al., 1994). Additionally, the calculation of muscle volume may also be subject to error due to the difficulty in accurately measuring the shape and size of the muscle (Maganaris et al., 2001). These limitations may result in an underestimation of specific tension in the study's results."

To calculate specific tension (ST) for this study, the following steps can be followed:
1. Calculate the moment (Mi) for each muscle using the formula:
   MAM = F / L
   where MAM is the moment arm, F is the force generated by the muscle's tendon, and L is the distance between the joint axis and the line of action of the muscle's force.
   The moment (Mi) for each muscle can be calculated by dividing the moment arm by the length of the muscle's force:
   Mi = MAM / L
2. Calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) for each muscle using the formula:
   PCSA = MuscleVolu / Lfiber
   where MuscleVolu is the volume of the muscle, and Lfiber is the length of the muscle's fibers.
   The pennation angle (?) can be used to calculate Lfiber:
   Lfiber = Lmuscle * sin(?)
   where Lmuscle is the length of the muscle.
3. Calculate the specific tension (ST) for each muscle using the formula:
   ST = STi * PCSAi
   where STi is the specific tension for the analyzed muscle, which can be found in literature.
   The specific tension for each muscle can be calculated using the formula:
   STi = Fi / PCSAi
   where Fi is the force generated by the muscle's tendon, and PCSAi is the physiological cross-sectional area for the analyzed muscle.
   The specific tension for each muscle can also be calculated using the formula:
   STi = MAMi / (PCSAi * Lfiberi * cos(?i))
   where MAMi is the moment arm for the analyzed muscle, PCSAi is the physiological cross-sectional area for the analyzed muscle, Lfiberi is the length of the muscle's fibers for the analyzed muscle, and cos(?i) is the cosine of the pennation angle for the analyzed muscle."	"

The study aims to investigate the accuracy of measurements in assessing specific tension through a three-muscle biomechanical model of elbow flexion. The authors collected measurements of parameters through MRI imaging and literature for comparison purposes. The results showed that using MRI measures yielded values of specific tension in agreement with functional expectations. However, the study did not mention any weaknesses in the calculation of specific tension due to assumptions in measuring muscle force or volume."
