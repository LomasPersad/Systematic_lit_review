ally outlined (Osirix 2.7.5, Osirix Foundation, Geneva,
Switzerland) in ~15 scans at 3.08 cm intervals along the

a spline curve was fitted to the ACSA data points
associated with each of the four component muscles
(vastus lateralis, VL; vastus intermedius, VI; rectus
femoris, RF; vastus medialis, VM) and muscle volume
was calculated as the area under the curve

MRI was performed prior to strength testing to
ensure that volume measurements were not influenced by
any exercise-induced fluid shifts","Muscle architecture was examined in the four constituent
QF muscles via ultrasonography (MyLab25, Esaote,
Genova, Italy) during MVC at optimum joint angle, with
the participant seated in the strength-testing chair

While the participant was sitting at rest, the
origin and insertion points and the lateral and medial
boundaries of each muscle were identified using ultraso-
nography and the distances between the points were measured. Thus, four sites, each corresponding to 50% of the appropriate muscle length along the mid-sagittal plane

For every ultrasound image obtained, hp and Lf were measured on at least three fascicular paths and the average of these measurements gave the hp and Lf for each muscle. In the case of the bi-pennate RF muscle, only the lateral hp and Lf was analysed, assuming that the  uscle architecture for the medial side was identical"," ACSA of each of the four QF heads was manu-

The procedure for determining the level of voluntary muscle
activation using the interpolated twitch technique (ITT) 
True maximal torque (TMT)
was calculated as:
TMT= MVCcorr/(1-t/T)

where t is the amplitude of the superimposed twitch, T the
value of the twitch before the MVC and MVCorr the
MVC corrected for co-activation. The percentage

full extension to provide the estimated dPT at optimum joint
angle, which was subsequently multiplied by 1.14 to
account for a 14% increase in dPT from rest to MVC

ment of specific tension, where QF PCSA was calculated by

estimated by using the ACSAs of the constituent QF muscles from a single slice taken at 40% of the femur
length, together with a series of regression equations, as
described in detail by Morse et al. (2007). This technique
has been shown to consistently underestimate QF volume
by 551 cm3 (Morse et al. 2007). Therefore, once QF volume
was assessed using this procedure, 551 cm3 was added to
the QF volume of each participant to provide a more
accurate estimation.","VL Lf measured during MVC at optimum joint angle was assumed to be representative of the mean Lf for the entire QF","","",""," Method 2 was identical to

Fourteen to 18 slices for each subject were analyzed beginning with the first proximal slice visualizing the four heads of the mQF group and continued distally until the slice just before the top of the patella. 

Muscle volume (cm3) was calculated by multiplying the activated CSA (cm2) in each
slice * 2 cm (slice thickness + interslice space). The slices
were then added together to calculate the volume of acti-
vated tissue","Vastus lateralis muscle can be used as surrogate of mQF (Trappe et al. 2001; Reeves et al. 2004). Fiber length was identifed by the following equation after measuring muscle length (fiber length/ muscle length = 0.23) Wickiewicz et al. 1983).

pennation angle of 15.6° was acquired from previously published data, which is the pennation angle of m. vastus lateralis at 60° of knee joint below horizontal during isometric contraction (Fukunaga et al. 1997; Ichinose et al. 1997)


Muscle length was measured as the distance between the most proximal and the most distal points in which the muscle was visible in three scout views captured with MRI (Fukunaga et al. 1992; Narici et al. 1992). Adjustments were made to account for Wber length during isometric actions at diVerent percentages of MVIT (Ichinose et al. 1997). The resting length was multiplied
by the percentage changes in fiber length when torque was 75, 30, 60, and 45% of MVIT for RES, PD, FREQ,
and AMP,

The subject sat on a custom-built chair, and the leg was strapped at knee joint angle of 60° below horizontal to a rigid lever arm with an inelastic strap to ensure that the knee extensors could perform only isometric actions he lever arm was established by mounting a load cell perpendicular to and 12 in. (33 cm) from the axis of rotation of the lever arm."," All force measures were gravity compensated

torque/ patella moment arm derived from cadavers

The moment arm was derived from cadavers and knee joints of able bodies, 0.04 m, at the same knee joint angle used in our study (Baltzopoulos 1995; Wickiewicz et al. 1983, 1984). Because the moment arm increases with muscle contraction and moment arm from cadavers shrinks after death, the percentage increase in the moment arm during ankle extension, 18%, was used in the calculation of the moment arm length for this lower extremity, extensor muscle group (Maganaris et al. 2001). A moment arm length of 0.047 m was used to correct torque to force","Four protocols of electrical stimulation were randomly delivered to both quadriceps femoris muscle (mQF)


All stimulation protocols were performed on one day.

restrained at the ankle using three 4.5-cm straps which held the foot against
a 10.6-cm foot pedal mounted at 1.83 rad (105° or 15° plantar flexion).

Force was measured 10.6 cm above the bottom of the heel. This distance
was selected to allow the pedal mounted to the force transducer to be
approximately half the length of an average foot (7). This design minimized
contributions from the foot muscles when measuring force output during
plantar flexor MVC.
