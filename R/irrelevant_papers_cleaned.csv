0,31817252.0,Maximizing Muscle Hypertrophy: A Systematic Review of Advanced Resistance Training Techniques and Methods.,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"BACKGROUND: Effective hypertrophy-oriented resistance training (RT) should comprise a combination of mechanical tension and metabolic stress. Regarding training variables, the most effective values are widely described in the literature. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the efficiency of advanced RT techniques and methods in comparison to traditional approaches. METHODS: MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from 1996 to September 2019 for all studies investigating the effects of advanced RT techniques and methods on muscle hypertrophy and training variables. Thirty articles met the inclusion criteria and were consequently included for the quality assessment and data extraction. RESULTS: Concerning the time-efficiency of training, the use of agonist-antagonist, upper-lower body supersets, drop and cluster sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, employment of fast, but controlled duration of eccentric contractions (~2s), and high-load RT supplemented with low-load RT under blood flow restriction may provide an additional stimulus and an advantage to traditional training protocols. With regard to the higher degree of mechanical tension, the use of accentuated eccentric loading in RT should be considered. Implementation of drop sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, low-load RT in conjunction with low-load RT under blood flow restriction could provide time-efficient solutions to increased metabolic stress. CONCLUSIONS: Due to insufficient evidence, it is difficult to provide specific guidelines for volume, intensity of effort, and frequency of previously mentioned RT techniques and methods. However, well-trained athletes may integrate advanced RT techniques and methods into their routines as an additional stimulus to break through plateaus and to prevent training monotony.",2019,16,24,,10.3390/ijerph16244897,#2636,Krzysztofik 2019,accentuated eccentric work
1,20400263.0,Pathophysiology and treatment of muscle tension dysphonia: a review of the current knowledge.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a clinical and diagnostic term describing a spectrum of disturbed vocal fold behavior caused by increased tension of the (para)laryngeal musculature. Recent knowledge introduced MTD as a bridge between functional and organic disorders. This review addresses the causal and contributing factors of MTD and evaluates the different treatment options. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (Pubmed, 1950-2009) and CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2009). Studies were included if they reviewed the classification of functional dysphonia or the pathophysiology of MTD. Etiology and pathophysiology of MTD and circumlaryngeal manual therapy (CMT) were obligatory based on reviews and prospective cohort studies because randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are nonexisting. Concerning the treatment options of voice therapy and vocal hygiene, selection was based on RCTs and systematic reviews. RESULTS: Etiological factors can be categorized into three new subgroups: (1) psychological and/or personality factors, (2) vocal misuse and abuse, and (3) compensation for underlying disease. The effective treatment options for MTD are (1) indirect therapy: vocal hygiene and patient education; (2) direct therapy: voice therapy and CMT; (3) medical treatment; and (4) surgery for secondary organic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: MTD is the pathological condition in which an excessive tension of the (para)laryngeal musculature, caused by a diverse number of etiological factors, leads to a disturbed voice. Etiological factors range from psychological/personality disorders and vocal misuse/abuse to compensatory vocal habits in case of laryngopharyngeal reflux, upper airway infections, and organic lesions. MTD needs to be approached in a multidisciplinary setting where close cooperation between a laryngologist and a speech language pathologist is possible.",2011,25,2,202-7,10.1016/j.jvoice.2009.10.009,#2637,VanHoutte 2011,
2,25249278.0,A review on the mechanisms of blood-flow restriction resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy.,Sports Med,"It has traditionally been believed that resistance training can only induce muscle growth when the exercise intensity is greater than 65% of the 1-repetition maximum (RM). However, more recently, the use of low-intensity resistance exercise with blood-flow restriction (BFR) has challenged this theory and consistently shown that hypertrophic adaptations can be induced with much lower exercise intensities (<50% 1-RM). Despite the potent hypertrophic effects of BFR resistance training being demonstrated by numerous studies, the underlying mechanisms responsible for such effects are not well defined. Metabolic stress has been suggested to be a primary factor responsible, and this is theorised to activate numerous other mechanisms, all of which are thought to induce muscle growth via autocrine and/or paracrine actions. However, it is noteworthy that some of these mechanisms do not appear to be mediated to any great extent by metabolic stress but rather by mechanical tension (another primary factor of muscle hypertrophy). Given that the level of mechanical tension is typically low with BFR resistance exercise (<50% 1-RM), one may question the magnitude of involvement of these mechanisms aligned to the adaptations reported with BFR resistance training. However, despite the low level of mechanical tension, it is plausible that the effects induced by the primary factors (mechanical tension and metabolic stress) are, in fact, additive, which ultimately contributes to the adaptations seen with BFR resistance training. Exercise-induced mechanical tension and metabolic stress are theorised to signal a number of mechanisms for the induction of muscle growth, including increased fast-twitch fibre recruitment, mechanotransduction, muscle damage, systemic and localised hormone production, cell swelling, and the production of reactive oxygen species and its variants, including nitric oxide and heat shock proteins. However, the relative extent to which these specific mechanisms are induced by the primary factors with BFR resistance exercise, as well as their magnitude of involvement in BFR resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy, requires further exploration.",2015,45,2,187-200,10.1007/s40279-014-0264-9,#2638,Pearson 2015,
3,17241104.0,The adaptations to strength training : morphological and neurological contributions to increased strength.,Sports Med,"High-resistance strength training (HRST) is one of the most widely practiced forms of physical activity, which is used to enhance athletic performance, augment musculo-skeletal health and alter body aesthetics. Chronic exposure to this type of activity produces marked increases in muscular strength, which are attributed to a range of neurological and morphological adaptations. This review assesses the evidence for these adaptations, their interplay and contribution to enhanced strength and the methodologies employed. The primary morphological adaptations involve an increase in the cross-sectional area of the whole muscle and individual muscle fibres, which is due to an increase in myofibrillar size and number. Satellite cells are activated in the very early stages of training; their proliferation and later fusion with existing fibres appears to be intimately involved in the hypertrophy response. Other possible morphological adaptations include hyperplasia, changes in fibre type, muscle architecture, myofilament density and the structure of connective tissue and tendons. Indirect evidence for neurological adaptations, which encompasses learning and coordination, comes from the specificity of the training adaptation, transfer of unilateral training to the contralateral limb and imagined contractions. The apparent rise in whole-muscle specific tension has been primarily used as evidence for neurological adaptations; however, morphological factors (e.g. preferential hypertrophy of type 2 fibres, increased angle of fibre pennation, increase in radiological density) are also likely to contribute to this phenomenon. Changes in inter-muscular coordination appear critical. Adaptations in agonist muscle activation, as assessed by electromyography, tetanic stimulation and the twitch interpolation technique, suggest small, but significant increases. Enhanced firing frequency and spinal reflexes most likely explain this improvement, although there is contrary evidence suggesting no change in cortical or corticospinal excitability. The gains in strength with HRST are undoubtedly due to a wide combination of neurological and morphological factors. Whilst the neurological factors may make their greatest contribution during the early stages of a training programme, hypertrophic processes also commence at the onset of training.",2007,37,2,145-68,10.2165/00007256-200737020-00004,#2639,Folland 2007,
4,16464122.0,Neural adaptations to resistive exercise: mechanisms and recommendations for training practices.,Sports Med,"It is generally accepted that neural factors play an important role in muscle strength gains. This article reviews the neural adaptations in strength, with the goal of laying the foundations for practical applications in sports medicine and rehabilitation. An increase in muscular strength without noticeable hypertrophy is the first line of evidence for neural involvement in acquisition of muscular strength. The use of surface electromyographic (SEMG) techniques reveal that strength gains in the early phase of a training regimen are associated with an increase in the amplitude of SEMG activity. This has been interpreted as an increase in neural drive, which denotes the magnitude of efferent neural output from the CNS to active muscle fibres. However, SEMG activity is a global measure of muscle activity. Underlying alterations in SEMG activity are changes in motor unit firing patterns as measured by indwelling (wire or needle) electrodes. Some studies have reported a transient increase in motor unit firing rate. Training-related increases in the rate of tension development have also been linked with an increased probability of doublet firing in individual motor units. A doublet is a very short interspike interval in a motor unit train, and usually occurs at the onset of a muscular contraction. Motor unit synchronisation is another possible mechanism for increases in muscle strength, but has yet to be definitely demonstrated. There are several lines of evidence for central control of training-related adaptation to resistive exercise. Mental practice using imagined contractions has been shown to increase the excitability of the cortical areas involved in movement and motion planning. However, training using imagined contractions is unlikely to be as effective as physical training, and it may be more applicable to rehabilitation. Retention of strength gains after dissipation of physiological effects demonstrates a strong practice effect. Bilateral contractions are associated with lower SEMG and strength compared with unilateral contractions of the same muscle group. SEMG magnitude is lower for eccentric contractions than for concentric contractions. However, resistive training can reverse these trends. The last line of evidence presented involves the notion that unilateral resistive exercise of a specific limb will also result in training effects in the unexercised contralateral limb (cross-transfer or cross-education). Peripheral involvement in training-related strength increases is much more uncertain. Changes in the sensory receptors (i.e. Golgi tendon organs) may lead to disinhibition and an increased expression of muscular force. Agonist muscle activity results in limb movement in the desired direction, while antagonist activity opposes that motion. Both decreases and increases in co-activation of the antagonist have been demonstrated. A reduction in antagonist co-activation would allow increased expression of agonist muscle force, while an increase in antagonist co-activation is important for maintaining the integrity of the joint. Thus far, it is not clear what the CNS will optimise: force production or joint integrity. The following recommendations are made by the authors based on the existing literature. Motor learning theory and imagined contractions should be incorporated into strength-training practice. Static contractions at greater muscle lengths will transfer across more joint angles. Submaximal eccentric contractions should be used when there are issues of muscle pain, detraining or limb immobilisation. The reversal of antagonists (antagonist-to-agonist) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation contraction pattern would be useful to increase the rate of tension development in older adults, thus serving as an important prophylactic in preventing falls. When evaluating the neural changes induced by strength training using EMG recording, antagonist EMG activity should always be measured and evaluated.",2006,36,2,133-49,10.2165/00007256-200636020-00004,#2640,Gabriel 2006,
5,26420238.0,Dose-Response Relationships of Resistance Training in Healthy Old Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Sports Med,"BACKGROUND: Resistance training (RT) is an intervention frequently used to improve muscle strength and morphology in old age. However, evidence-based, dose-response relationships regarding specific RT variables (e.g., training period, frequency, intensity, volume) are unclear in healthy old adults. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to determine the general effects of RT on measures of muscle strength and morphology and to provide dose-response relationships of RT variables through an analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that could improve muscle strength and morphology in healthy old adults. DATA SOURCES: A computerized, systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library from January 1984 up to June 2015 to identify all RCTs related to RT in healthy old adults. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The initial search identified 506 studies, with a final yield of 25 studies. Only RCTs that examined the effects of RT in adults with a mean age of 65 and older were included. The 25 studies quantified at least one measure of muscle strength or morphology and sufficiently described training variables (e.g., training period, frequency, volume, intensity). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We quantified the overall effects of RT on measures of muscle strength and morphology by computing weighted between-subject standardized mean differences (SMDbs) between intervention and control groups. We analyzed the data for the main outcomes of one-repetition maximum (1RM), maximum voluntary contraction under isometric conditions (MVC), and muscle morphology (i.e., cross-sectional area or volume or thickness of muscles) and assessed the methodological study quality by Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using I2 and χ2 statistics. A random effects meta-regression was calculated to explain the influence of key training variables on the effectiveness of RT in terms of muscle strength and morphology. For meta-regression, training variables were divided into the following subcategories: volume, intensity, and rest. In addition to meta-regression, dose-response relationships were calculated independently for single training variables (e.g., training frequency). RESULTS: RT improved muscle strength substantially (mean SMDbs = 1.57; 25 studies), but had small effects on measures of muscle morphology (mean SMDbs = 0.42; nine studies). Specifically, RT produced large effects in both 1RM of upper (mean SMDbs = 1.61; 11 studies) and lower (mean SMDbs = 1.76; 19 studies) extremities and a medium effect in MVC of lower (mean SMDbs = 0.76; four studies) extremities. Results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables ""training period"" (p = 0.04) and ""intensity"" (p < 0.01) as well as ""total time under tension"" (p < 0.01) had significant effects on muscle strength, with the largest effect sizes for the longest training periods (mean SMDbs = 2.34; 50-53 weeks), intensities of 70-79% of the 1RM (mean SMDbs = 1.89), and total time under tension of 6.0 s (mean SMDbs = 3.61). A tendency towards significance was found for rest in between sets (p = 0.06), with 60 s showing the largest effect on muscle strength (mean SMDbs = 4.68; two studies). We also determined the independent effects of the remaining training variables on muscle strength. The following independently computed training variables are most effective in improving measures of muscle strength: a training frequency of two sessions per week (mean SMDbs = 2.13), a training volume of two to three sets per exercise (mean SMDbs = 2.99), seven to nine repetitions per set (mean SMDbs = 1.98), and a rest of 4.0 s between repetitions (SMDbs = 3.72). With regard to measures of muscle morphology, the small number of identified studies allowed us to calculate meta-regression for the subcategory training volume only. No single training volume variable significantly predicted RT effects on measures of muscle morphology. Additional training variables were independently computed to detect the largest effect for the single training variable. A training period of 50-53 weeks, a training frequency of three sessions per week, a training volume of two to three sets per exercise, seven to nine repetitions per set, a training intensity from 51 to 69% of the 1RM, a total time under tension of 6.0 s, a rest of 120 s between sets, and a rest of 2.5 s between repetitions turned out to be most effective. LIMITATIONS: The current results must be interpreted with caution because of the poor overall methodological study quality (mean PEDro score 4.6 points) and the considerable large heterogeneity (I2) = 80%, χ2 = 163.1, df = 32, p < 0.01) for muscle strength. In terms of muscle morphology, our search identified nine studies only, which is why we consider our findings preliminary. While we were able to determine a dose-response relationship based on specific individual training variables with respect to muscle strength and morphology, it was not possible to ascertain any potential interactions between these variables. We recognize the limitation that the results may not represent one general dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of RT on specific measures of upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle morphology in healthy old adults. In addition, we were able to extract dose-response relationships for key training variables (i.e., volume, intensity, rest), informing clinicians and practitioners to design effective RTs for muscle strength and morphology. Training period, intensity, time under tension, and rest in between sets play an important role in improving muscle strength and morphology and should be implemented in exercise training programs targeting healthy old adults. Still, further research is needed to reveal optimal dose-response relationships following RT in healthy as well as mobility limited and/or frail old adults.",2015,45,12,1693-720,10.1007/s40279-015-0385-9,#2641,Borde 2015,
6,16700660.0,Physical fitness assessment: an update.,J Long Term Eff Med Implants,"The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) gives the following definition of health-related physical fitness: Physical fitness is defined as a set of attributes that people have or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity. It is also characterized by (1) an ability to perform daily activities with vigor, and (2) a demonstration of traits and capacities that are associated with a low risk of premature development of hypokinetic diseases (e.g., those associated with physical inactivity). Information from an individual's health and medical records can be combined with information from physical fitness assessment to meet the specific health goals and rehabilitative needs of that individual. Attaining adequate informed consent from participants prior to exercise testing is mandatory because of ethical and legal considerations.A physical fitness assessment includes measures of body composition, cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular fitness, and musculoskeletal flexibility. The three common techniques for assessing body composition are hydrostatic weighing, and skinfold measurements, and anthropometric measurements. Cardiorespiratory endurance is a crucial component of physical fitness assessment because of its strong correlation with health and health risks. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is the traditionally accepted criterion for measuring cardiorespiratory endurance. Although maximal-effort tests must be used to measure VO2max, submaximal exercise can be used to estimate this value. Muscular fitness has historically been used to describe an individual's integrated status of muscular strength and muscular endurance. An individual's muscular strength is specific to a particular muscle or muscle group and refers to the maximal force (N or kg) that the muscle or muscle group can generate. Dynamic strength can be assessed by measuring the movement of an individual's body against an external load. Isokinetic testing may be performed by assessing the muscle tension generated throughout a range of motion at a constant angular velocity. The ability of a muscle group to perform repeated contractions over a specific period of time that is sufficient to cause fatigue is termed muscular endurance. Musculoskeletal flexibility evaluations focus on the joints and associated structures, ligaments, and muscles that cross the joints. The sit-and-reach test and the behind-the-back reach test satisfy many of the criteria for physical assessment of musculoskeletal flexibility. A physical fitness assessment must be integrated into all activities of daily living, as well as the physician's examination, to assess and promote health.",2006,16,2,193-204,10.1615/jlongtermeffmedimplants.v16.i2.90,#2642,Wilder 2006,
7,1791172.0,The determinants of skeletal muscle force and power: their adaptability with changes in activity pattern.,J Biomech,"A kinetic model of the cross-bridge cycle in skeletal muscle is presented with special reference to the rate limiting steps regulating the peak rate of force development (dP/dt), peak force (P0), and the maximal shortening speed (Vmax). Force production in skeletal muscle is dependent on the number of cross-bridges in the strongly bound, high-force state (AM'-ADP), and during a peak isometric contraction this state is the dominant cross-bridge form. The peak force and power output of a muscle depends upon numerous factors to include: (1) muscle and fiber size and length; (2) architecture, such as the angle and physical properties of the fiber-tendon attachment, and the fiber to muscle length ratio; (3) fiber type; (4) number of cross-bridges in parallel; (5) force per cross-bridge; (6) peak dP/dt; (7) force-velocity relationship; (8) fiber Vmax; (9) force-pCa2+ relationship: and (10) the force-frequency (action potential Hz) relationship. In this paper, we discuss these determinants of force and power output, and consider how they adapt to both muscle unloading (induced by hindlimb suspension) and programs of regular endurance exercise. Slow- and fast-twitch fibers have similar capacities to generate specific tension (kg cm-2). However, fast fibers show a considerably higher peak dP/dt, Vmax, and power output. The high Vmax of the fast-twitch fiber is likely due to the high myofibrillar ATPase activity of the fast myosin isozyme. Both hindlimb suspension and regular endurance exercise have been shown to induce fiber type specific changes in single fiber function. For example, fiber size and the peak tetanic tension of the slow oxidative (SO), fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG), and fast glycolytic (FG) fiber types were generally unaltered by endurance exercise-training. In contrast, hindlimb suspension produced cell atrophy in all fiber types and a reduced specific tension in the SO but not the FOG or FG fiber types. Both exercise-training and HS shifted the force-pCa curve to the right, and increased the Vmax of the SO fiber type. From the standpoint of work capacity or the ability to move a load, the important functional property is power output. Peak power is obtained at loads considerably below 50% of PO, and it is correlated with the percentage of fast-twitch fibers. Peak power can be increased by both dynamic and isometric programs of exercise-training.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1991,24 Suppl 1,,111-22,10.1016/0021-9290(91)90382-w,#2643,Fitts 1991,
8,21142282.0,Developing maximal neuromuscular power: Part 1--biological basis of maximal power production.,Sports Med,"This series of reviews focuses on the most important neuromuscular function in many sport performances, the ability to generate maximal muscular power. Part 1 focuses on the factors that affect maximal power production, while part 2, which will follow in a forthcoming edition of Sports Medicine, explores the practical application of these findings by reviewing the scientific literature relevant to the development of training programmes that most effectively enhance maximal power production. The ability of the neuromuscular system to generate maximal power is affected by a range of interrelated factors. Maximal muscular power is defined and limited by the force-velocity relationship and affected by the length-tension relationship. The ability to generate maximal power is influenced by the type of muscle action involved and, in particular, the time available to develop force, storage and utilization of elastic energy, interactions of contractile and elastic elements, potentiation of contractile and elastic filaments as well as stretch reflexes. Furthermore, maximal power production is influenced by morphological factors including fibre type contribution to whole muscle area, muscle architectural features and tendon properties as well as neural factors including motor unit recruitment, firing frequency, synchronization and inter-muscular coordination. In addition, acute changes in the muscle environment (i.e. alterations resulting from fatigue, changes in hormone milieu and muscle temperature) impact the ability to generate maximal power. Resistance training has been shown to impact each of these neuromuscular factors in quite specific ways. Therefore, an understanding of the biological basis of maximal power production is essential for developing training programmes that effectively enhance maximal power production in the human.",2011,41,1,17-38,10.2165/11537690-000000000-00000,#2644,Cormie 2011,
9,23294691.0,Training principles for fascial connective tissues: scientific foundation and suggested practical applications.,J Bodyw Mov Ther,"Conventional sports training emphasizes adequate training of muscle fibres, of cardiovascular conditioning and/or neuromuscular coordination. Most sports-associated overload injuries however occur within elements of the body wide fascial net, which are then loaded beyond their prepared capacity. This tensional network of fibrous tissues includes dense sheets such as muscle envelopes, aponeuroses, as well as specific local adaptations, such as ligaments or tendons. Fibroblasts continually but slowly adapt the morphology of these tissues to repeatedly applied challenging loading stimulations. Principles of a fascia oriented training approach are introduced. These include utilization of elastic recoil, preparatory counter movement, slow and dynamic stretching, as well as rehydration practices and proprioceptive refinement. Such training should be practiced once or twice a week in order to yield in a more resilient fascial body suit within a time frame of 6-24 months.

As a consequence, the aim of this study was to identify the hyper-elastic behavior of the human sternocleidomastoideus muscle in tension using different constitutive laws. Ten sternocleidomastoideus muscles were tested in vitro. The hyper-elastic behavior was modeled with an exponential law and a hyper-elastic constitutive law studied analytically. The latter was also studied with an inverse approach using a subject-specific, finite-element model of each muscle. The three approaches were compared statistically. From these laws and methods, the shear modulus μ (4 to 98 kPa) and the curvature parameter α (17 to 52) were identified. Both the analytical and finite-element approaches gave parameters of the same order of magnitude. The parameters of the exponential and hyper-elastic laws were linked thanks to simple linear equations. Our results evidence that the hyper-elastic tension behavior of human sternocleidomastoideus muscle can be described using a simple model (exponential) considering basic geometric features (initial length and cross-sectional area).",2012,15,,131-40,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2012.06.013,#2647,Gras 2012,
11,30917886.0,Detection of Muscle Tension Dysphonia Using Eulerian Video Magnification: A Pilot Study.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Eulerian Video Magnification software is useful in diagnosis of muscle tension dysphonia (MTD). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. METHODS: Adult patients scheduled in a tertiary care laryngology practice for evaluation of dysphonia were recruited between November 2016 and March 2017. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from patient charts. Diagnosis of MTD was confirmed with videostroboscopic and physical exam and by a speech-language pathologist. Eighteen MTD patients were video recorded while at rest and with phonation. Five patients without MTD also were analyzed as controls. Videos were analyzed using Eulerian Video Magnification software (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to assess change in blood flow at the forehead, infrahyoid muscles, and sternocleidomastoid muscles, while using the values of the background wall as a control value. RESULTS: Patients with MTD demonstrated little change in perfusion to the infrahyoid muscles of the neck while phonating (+1% ± 55%). Control subjects demonstrated an increase in perfusion to the infrahyoid muscles while phonating (+102% ± 164%), with this change being significant when comparing the two groups (P = 0.04, t = 2.189, df = 21). A change in perfusion of 0% or less to infrahyoid muscles was 75% sensitive and 70% specific for diagnosis of MTD. No differences in perfusion were found between other regions assessed. Patient age and gender did not correlate with any change in perfusion between rest and phonation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Eulerian Video Magnification can be used in the diagnosis of MTD by focusing on the difference in perfusion to the infrahyoid muscles between rest and phonation.",2020,34,4,622-628,10.1016/j.jvoice.2019.02.006,#2650,Adleberg 2020,Dysphonia
12,23871332.0,Viscoelastic properties of the human sternocleidomastoideus muscle of aged women in relaxation.,J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,"Improving the numerical models of the head and neck complex requires understanding the mechanical properties of the muscles; however, most of the data in existing literature have been obtained from studies on animal muscles. Muscle is hyper-elastic, but also viscoelastic. The hyper-elastic behaviour of the human sternocleidomastoideus muscle has been previously studied. The aim of this study is to propose a characterization of the viscoelastic properties of the same human muscle in relaxation. Ten muscles were tested in vitro. The viscoelastic behaviour was modelled with a generalized Maxwell's model studied at the first and second order, using an inverse approach with a subject-specific, finite-element model of each muscle. Based on these models, relaxation times τ (first order: 103s; second order: 18s and 395s) and ratio moduli γ (first order: 0.33; second order: 0.20 and 0.19) were identified. The first-order model provided a good estimate of the relaxation curve (R(2): 0.82), but the second-order model was more representative of the experimental response (R(2): 0.97). Our results provide evidence that the viscoelastic behaviour of the human sternocleidomastoideus muscle can be described using a second-order Maxwell's model and that - combined with the previously identified hyper-elastic properties - the response of the muscle in tension and relaxation is fully characterized.",2013,27,,77-83,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2013.06.010,#2652,Gras 2013,Biomechanics
13,34103422.0,STIMULATION OF THE CYCLIC AMP/GMP SIGNALLING ENHANCES THE RELAXATION OF ISOLATED HUMAN DETRUSOR SMOOTH MUSCLE ACHIEVED BY PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS.,Georgian Med News,"Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes are considered being key proteins in controlling the function of smooth musculature in the human urinary tract. The use of PDE inhibitors (PDE-Is) to treat erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptomatology (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is well established. It has been shown that PDE-Is can reverse the tension induced by means of muscarinergic agents of detrusor smooth muscle and enhance the production of cyclic nucleotides. In clinical settings, the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine had beneficial effects in patients presenting with voiding dysfunctions. This prompted us to evaluate further the mechanism of action of PDE-Is on bladder smooth musculature. Using the tissue bath technique, relaxant responses of human detrusor smooth muscle, challenged by acetylcholine (1 µM), to vinpocetine (PDE1-I), rolipram (PDE4-I), MY 5445 and sildenafil (PDE5-Is) (0.1 µM, 1 µM, and 10 µM) were investigated with and without pre-exposure of the tissue to threshold concentrations of the NO donor drug sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (0.02 µM). The non-specific PDE-I papaverine was used as a reference compound. The cumulative addition of forskolin or SNP exerted a pronounced reversion of the tension induced by means of ACh, starting at a concentration of 1 µM (forskolin, -25,6%) and 0.1 µM (SNP, -20%), respectively. There were marginal responses of the detrusor smooth musculature to the PDE-Is, the relaxation measured ranged from -12% (vinpocetine/sildenafil) to -19% (rolipram, MY 5445). Exposure of the tissue to a threshold concentration of SNP increased the reversion of tension induced by vinpocetine (-40%), rolipram (-50%) and MY 5445 (-45%). An enhancement in the potency of the drugs was also registered. A threshold concentration of SNP did not significantly affect the maximum reversion of tension brought about by sildenafil but added positively to the in vitro potency of the PDE5-I.

14,30571290.0,Architectural and functional specifics of the human triceps surae muscle in vivo and its adaptation to microgravity.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Long-term exposure to microgravity (μG) is known to reduce the strength of a skeletal muscle contraction and the level of general physical performance in humans, while little is known about its effect on muscle architecture. Architectural and contractile properties of the triceps surae (TS) muscle were determined in vivo for male cosmonauts in response ( n = 8) to a spaceflight (213.0 ± 30.5 days). The maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), tetanic tension ( Р(о)), and voluntary and electrically evoked contraction times and force deficiency (P(d)) were determined. The ankle was positioned at 15° dorsiflexion (-15°) and 0, 15, and 30° plantar flexion, with the knee set at 90°. At each position, longitudinal ultrasonic images of the medial (MG) and lateral (LG) gastrocnemius and soleus (SOL) muscles were obtained while the subject was relaxed. After a spaceflight, MVC and P(о) decreased by 42 and 26%, respectively, and P(d) increased by 50%. The rate of tension of a voluntary contraction substantially reduced but evoked contractions remained unchanged. In the passive condition, fiber length ( L(f)) changed from 43, 57, and 35 mm (knee, 0°; ankle, -15°) to 34, 38, and 25 mm (knee, 0°; ankle, 30°) for MG, LG, and SOL, respectively, and Θ(f) changed from 27, 21, and 23° (knee, 0°; ankle, -15°) to 43, 29, and 34° (knee, 0°; ankle, 30°) for MG, LG, and SOL, respectively. Different L(f) and Θ(f), and their changes after spaceflight, might be related to differences in force-producing capabilities of the muscles and elastic characteristics of tendons and aponeuroses. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The present work was the first to combine measuring the fiber length and pennation angle (ultrasound imaging) as main determinants of mechanical force production and evaluating the muscle function after a long-duration spaceflight. The results demonstrate that muscles with different functional roles may differently respond to unloading, and this circumstance is important to consider when planning rehabilitation after unloading of any kind, paying particular attention to postural muscles.",2019,126,4,880-893,10.1152/japplphysiol.00634.2018,#2655,Koryak 2019,lengths and angles of fibers
15,10751098.0,Tension regulation during lengthening and shortening actions of the human soleus muscle.,Eur J Appl Physiol,"In the present study we investigated tension regulation in the human soleus (SOL) muscle during controlled lengthening and shortening actions. Eleven subjects performed plantar flexor efforts on an ankle torque motor through 30 degrees of ankle displacement (75 degrees -105 degrees internal ankle angle) at lengthening and shortening velocities of 5, 15 and 30 degrees. S(-1). To isolate the SOL from the remainder of the triceps surae, the subject's knee was flexed to 60 degrees during all trials. Voluntary plantar flexor efforts were performed under two test conditions: (1) maximal voluntary activation (MVA) of the SOL, and (2) constant submaximal voluntary activation (SVA) of the SOL. SVA trials were performed with direct visual feedback of the SOL electromyogram (EMG) at a level resulting in a torque output of 30% of isometric maximum. Angle-specific (90 degrees ankle angle) torque and EMG of the SOL, medial gastrocnemius (MG) and tibialis anterior (TA) were recorded. In seven subjects from the initial group, the test protocol was repeated under submaximal percutaneous electrical activation (SEA) of SOL (to 30% isometric maximal effort). Lengthening torques were significantly greater than shortening torques in all test conditions. Lengthening torques in MVA and SVA were independent of velocity and remained at the isometric level, whereas SEA torques were greater than isometric torques and increased at higher lengthening velocities. Shortening torques were lower than the isometric level for all conditions. However, whereas SVA and SEA torques decreased at higher velocities of shortening, MVA torques were independent of velocity. These results indicate velocity- and activation-type-specific tension regulation in the human SOL muscle.",2000,81,5,375-83,10.1007/s004210050057,#2656,Pinniger 2000,

Bundles of rabbit ventricular cells which contained either fast-cycling RV1 myosin or slowly-cycling RV3 myosin and bundles of human atrial cells were chemically skinned by exposure to saponin. Skinned bundles were rapidly activated with calcium using the method of Moisescu and Thieleczek (1978). Our results suggest that the relation between pCa and tension is not different for skinned bundles of rabbit ventricular cells that contain either fast or slowly cycling myosin cross-bridges. The pattern of calcium activation, i.e. maximal to submaximal or submaximal to maximal, was also found not to influence the relation between tension and pCa for either rabbit ventricular or human atrial muscle. The tension-pCa relation of cardiac muscle was not altered by conditions that have been shown to alter the tension-pCa relation of skeletal muscle. These results suggest that the mechanisms responsible for regulating force development at the level of the thick and thin filaments that have been reported for skeletal muscle, are absent in cardiac muscle.",1986,18,1,55-66,10.1016/s0022-2828(86)80982-8,#2657,Pagani 1986,

Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to investigate differences in extralaryngeal muscles' tension in patients with MTD compared with normal speakers. sEMG was examined as a diagnostic tool to differentiate between patients with MTD and controls. METHODS: Eighteen patients with MTD and 44 normal speakers were included in the study. All subjects were evaluated with videostroboscopy, voice assessment protocol, and sEMG. sEMG was performed on three locations of the anterior neck. Measurements were taken during silence, phonation tasks, and while reading, with comparisons made between both study groups. RESULTS: Patients with MTD did not express higher levels of sEMG during rest, phonation, or reading compared with normal speakers. There were no significant differences in sEMG values between males and females in both study groups. CONCLUSION: sEMG was not able to detect an increase in muscle tension in patients with MTD. The results of this study do not support the use of sEMG as a diagnostic tool for distinguishing patients with and without MTD. Clinical examination with laryngeal palpation, videostroboscopy, and dysphonia severity index remain the key investigations.",2013,27,2,177-86,10.1016/j.jvoice.2011.06.006,#2658,VanHoutte 2013,
18,30595236.0,Vibratory Onset of Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia and Muscle Tension Dysphonia: A High-Speed Video Study✰.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD) is a challenging voice disorder to diagnose, often erroneously diagnosed as muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) or vocal tremor, due to its similarity in auditory and perceptual presentation. Assessments using laryngoscopy or strobolaryngoscopy procedures have demonstrated limited utility in the diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia. High-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) provides visualization of the precise vibratory pattern of phonatory onset and thus, offers an alternative to previous diagnostic strategies for visual diagnosis of AdSD. The purpose of this study was to examine vibratory onset of patients with AdSD and patients with MTD using HSV methodology. METHODS: HSV of six adults with AdSD and five adults with MTD were captured during sustained phonation. Digital kymography was used to obtain precise vibrogram data at the mid-membranous region of the vocal fold prior to and at the onset of phonation. Voice onset delay was examined by (1) quantifying timing of prephonatory delay and steady state delay and (2) describing vocal fold onset movements qualitatively in each diagnosis. RESULTS: HSV adequately captured the phonatory onset of the vocal folds. Voice onset delay was not significantly different between AdSD and MTD. However, there were distinct differences in voice onset gestures. Both AdSD and MTD patients presented with vocal hyperfunction during the onset of phonation. In a subset of AdSD patients, a rapid sustained adduction occurred following the initial vibratory motion. Vocal fold vibration then continued until steady phonation was achieved. This oscillatory break pattern was not observed in patients with MTD. Therefore, there appears to be differences in vocal fold vibratory onset motion between MTD and AdSD. CONCLUSION: HSV captures the precise vibratory onset in patients with MTD and AdSD. Differences were most notable after vibratory onset as opposed to vibratory delay measurements. Examination of voice onset gesture may offer an additional laryngeal parameter to assist in the differential diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia.",2020,34,4,598-603,10.1016/j.jvoice.2018.12.010,#2659,Chen 2020,Digital kymography
19,9619974.0,Muscle spindles are concentrated in the superior vocalis subcompartment of the human thyroarytenoid muscle.,J Voice,"It is hypothesized that different parts of the thyroarytenoid muscle (TA) are functionally specialized. Specifically, the TA is divided into a lateral muscularis compartment and a medial vocalis compartment. This study examined the distribution of muscle spindles throughout the human TA as an indicator of these functional differences. Histological cross-sections from the anterior, middle, and posterior regions of five human membranous vocal folds were examined for the number and location of muscle spindles. There was an average of 6.1 muscle spindles in sections from each region with no significant variation between the different regions (p < .05). However, in sections from all three regions, the muscle spindles were always found to be concentrated in the superior medial quadrant of the TA (mean 85.9%, p < .01). The inferior medial, superior lateral, and inferior lateral quadrants of the TA contained 11.96%, 2.17%, and 0%, respectively, of the total muscle spindles. Within the superior medial quadrant, most of the muscle spindles were localized in the most superficial part of the muscle. The results of this study demonstrate that the majority of TA muscle spindles are concentrated in its superior medial quadrant, an area we have termed the superior vocalis subcompartment (SC). This finding suggests that the superior vocalis SC is functionally distinct from the remainder of the TA. It is hypothesized that tension in the superior vocalis SC can be controlled independently from the remainder of the TA, and this capability is used to effect the biomechanics of vocal fold vibration during phonation.",1998,12,1,16-Jul,10.1016/s0892-1997(98)80070-2,#2661,Sanders 1998,
20,25831858.0,Experimental evaluation of fiber orientation based material properties of skeletal muscle in tension.,Mol Cell Biomech,"Biomechanical researches are essential to develop new techniques to improve the clinical relevance. Skeletal muscle generates the force which results in the motion of human body, so it is essential to study the mechanical and structural properties of skeletal muscle. Many researchers have carried out mechanical study of skeletal muscle with in-vivo testing. This work aims to examine anisotropic mechanical behavior of skeletal muscle with in vitro test (tensile test). It is important to understand the mechanical and structural behavior of skeletal muscle when it is subjected to external loading; the research aims to determine the structural properties of skeletal muscle by tensile.testing. Tensile testing is performed on 5 samples of skeletal muscle of a goat at the rate of 1 mm/min with fiber orientation along the length and 45 degrees inclined to the length. It is found that muscle is stiffer in the direction parallel to the muscle fiber than at 45 degrees to the muscle fibers. The tensile strength of the skeletal muscle along the fiber direction is 0.44 MPa at maximum load of 110 N and for direction 45 degrees inclined to the muscle fibers, the strength is 0.234 MPa at max load 43 N. The displacement of Muscle sample against the maximum load is small along the length of the muscle fiber i.e. under longitudinal elongation [15.257 mm] as compared to 45 degrees inclined to the length of skeletal muscle [17.775 mm] and under cross fiber elongation [19.7291 mm by FEA]. The testing is not performed for 90 degrees fiber orientation due to unavailability of soft tissue in cross fiber direction of the required specification, but finite element analysis is done on the skeletal muscle for the cross fiber orientation. As the fiber orientation within skeletal muscle differs with respect to the length of the muscle, the stiffness of skeletal muscle is also changing effectively. Hence skeletal muscle exhibits the anisotropic mechanical behavior.",2014,11,2,113-28,,#2662,Kuthe 2014,

We propose that repairing the 3 muscle tension line groups in the nasolabial complex will have improved aesthetic results. METHODS: Micro-computed tomographic scans were performed on the nasolabial tissues of 5 normal aborted fetuses and used to construct a 3-dimensional model to study the nasolabial muscle complex structure. RESULTS: The micro-computed tomographic (CT) scans showed the close relationship and interaction between the muscle fibers of nasalis, pars peripheralis, levator labii superioris, and pars marginalis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the 2-dimensional images obtained from the micro-computed tomographic scans, we suggest the concept of nasolabial muscle complex and muscle tension line group theory: there is a close relationship among the alar part of the nasalis, depressor septi muscle, orbicularis oris muscle, and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi. The tension line groups are 3 tension line structures in the nasolabial muscle complex that interlock with each other at the intersections and maintain the specific shape and aesthetics of the lip and nose.",2015,26,2,469-72,10.1097/SCS.0000000000001459,#2663,Yin 2015,
22,15863118.0,A new method for measuring passive length-tension properties of human gastrocnemius muscle in vivo.,J Biomech,"The study of muscle growth and muscle length adaptations requires measurement of passive length-tension properties of individual muscles, but until now such measurements have only been made in animal muscles. We describe a new method for measuring passive length-tension properties of human gastrocnemius muscles in vivo. Passive ankle torque and ankle angle data were obtained as the ankle was rotated through its full range with the knee in a range of positions. To extract gastrocnemius passive length-tension curves from passive torque-angle data it was assumed that passive ankle torque was the sum of torque due to structures which crossed only the ankle joint (this torque was a 6-parameter function of ankle joint angle) and a torque due to the gastrocnemius muscle (a 3-parameter function of knee and ankle angle). Parameter values were estimated with non-linear regression and used to reconstruct passive length-tension curves of the gastrocnemius. The reliability of the method was examined in 11 subjects by comparing three sets of measurements: two on the same day and the other at least a week later. Length-tension curves were reproducible: the average root mean square error was 5.1+/-1.1 N for pairs of measurements taken within a day and 7.3+/-1.2 N for pairs of measurements taken at least a week apart (about 3% and 6% of maximal passive tension, respectively). Length-tension curves were sensitive to mis-specification of moment arms, but changes in length-tension curves were not. The new method enables reliable measurement of passive length-tension properties of human gastrocnemius in vivo, and is likely to be useful for investigation of changes in length-tension curves over time.",2005,38,6,1333-41,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.05.046,#2665,Hoang 2005,
23,28392437.0,A model of cardiac contraction based on novel measurements of tension development in human cardiomyocytes.,J Mol Cell Cardiol,"Experimental data from human cardiac myocytes at body temperature is crucial for a quantitative understanding of clinically relevant cardiac function and development of whole-organ computational models. However, such experimental data is currently very limited. Specifically, important measurements to characterize changes in tension development in human cardiomyocytes that occur with perturbations in cell length are not available. To address this deficiency, in this study we present an experimental data set collected from skinned human cardiac myocytes, including the passive and viscoelastic properties of isolated myocytes, the steady-state force calcium relationship at different sarcomere lengths, and changes in tension following a rapid increase or decrease in length, and after constant velocity shortening. This data set is, to our knowledge, the first characterization of length and velocity-dependence of tension generation in human skinned cardiac myocytes at body temperature. We use this data to develop a computational model of contraction and passive viscoelasticity in human myocytes. Our model includes troponin C kinetics, tropomyosin kinetics, a three-state crossbridge model that accounts for the distortion of crossbridges, and the cellular viscoelastic response. Each component is parametrized using our experimental data collected in human cardiomyocytes at body temperature. Furthermore we are able to confirm that properties of length-dependent activation at 37°C are similar to other species, with a shift in calcium sensitivity and increase in maximum tension. We revise our model of tension generation in the skinned isolated myocyte to replicate reported tension traces generated in intact muscle during isometric tension, to provide a model of human tension generation for multi-scale simulations. This process requires changes to calcium sensitivity, cooperativity, and crossbridge transition rates. We apply this model within multi-scale simulations of biventricular cardiac function and further refine the parametrization within the whole organ context, based on obtaining a healthy ejection fraction. This process reveals that crossbridge cycling rates differ between skinned myocytes and intact myocytes.",2017,106,,68-83,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2017.03.008,#2666,Land 2017,Cardiac muscle
24,19779124.0,Changes in the mechanical properties of human quadriceps muscle after eccentric exercise.,In Vivo,"Muscular adaptation which occurs following eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage has been associated with changes in the mechanical properties of muscle manifested as a shift in the length-tension relationship towards longer muscle lengths. However, it is not clear whether this shift is a long term adaptation to eccentric exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate functional adaptations to skeletal muscle damage in humans, tracking such responses several days into muscle recovery. Ten healthy young men performed an eccentric exercise protocol involving the quadriceps muscle and functional measurements were performed before and on days 1, 2, 5, 8, 12 and 16 post-exercise. Blood samples were also withdrawn before and at 6 h, and 2 days, 5 days and 16 days post-exercise. The exercise protocol resulted in muscle damage, indicated by changes in clinical markers including increased serum creatine kinase activity and muscle soreness compared to pre-exercise levels (p<0.05-0.001). An acute, but not sustained shift in the quadriceps isokinetic and isometric angle-torque curves towards longer muscle lengths was observed post-exercise (p<0.05). It was speculated that the functional adaptations following eccentric exercise might be affected by the short resting and functional length of the quadriceps muscle, relative to its optimum. More studies are needed to confirm the hypothesis that a sustained shift in the muscle's length-tension relationship, as an adaptation after lengthening contraction-induced damage, is muscle specific.",2009,23,5,859-65,,#2667,Philippou 2009,
25,19931631.0,Direct effect of cigarette smoke on human pulmonary artery tension.,Pulm Pharmacol Ther,"The effect of chronic cigarette smoke on pulmonary artery (PA) tension has been studied extensively; nevertheless, the direct effect of cigarette smoke is poorly understood. We investigated the direct effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on PA tension in non-smokers, smokers, and COPD patients in vitro. PA samples from 35 patients who underwent lung resection were examined by measuring isometric tension in response to increasing serotonin concentrations. CSE dose dependently inhibited the response to serotonin in smokers and COPD patients, and to a lesser extent in non-smokers. CSE-induced relaxation was similarly inhibited by the nonspecific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NOARG and the specific inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor l-NIL, mainly in non-smokers and smokers, and to a lesser extent in COPD patients. Immunostaining of iNOS in PA samples was greater for smokers and COPD patients compared with non-smokers, which explains the lesser effect of CSE on PA tension in non-smokers. Moreover, CSE induced the release of nitrite via iNOS in human PA smooth muscle cells. In conclusion, CSE inhibition of serotonin-induced PA contraction was mediated mainly by iNOS in non-smokers, smokers, and COPD patients, but in different ways, which may be explained by differential iNOS expression in the PA of these patients.",2010,23,3,222-8,10.1016/j.pupt.2009.11.001,#2668,Ortiz 2010,

Recently, Rho-kinase has been reported to be involved in the contractile mechanism of smooth muscles in various organs. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether or not Rho-kinase is expressed in the human ureteral smooth muscle, and to study its role regarding human ureteral smooth muscle contractility. METHODS: Ureteral samples were obtained from human adult subjects undergoing radical nephrectomy. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were performed to determine the presence of Rho-kinase in human ureter. Functional studies were performed with human ureteral strips suspended in organ bath, and the effects of Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase, on baseline tensions, spontaneous contractions, and electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions were analyzed. RESULTS: The results of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting study indicated that Rho-kinase is present in human ureteral smooth muscle. In functional analysis, Y-27632 was shown to decrease the baseline tension. And, both spontaneous and EFS-induced contractile responses of human ureteral strips were attenuated by Y-27632 in dose-dependent manners. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, the results of the present study indicate that Rho-kinase is present in human ureteral smooth muscle and may play an important role in the intricate mechanism of human ureteral contractility and tone.",2005,24,2,136-41,10.1002/nau.20096,#2669,Hong 2005,
27,22163702.0,MC sensor--a novel method for measurement of muscle tension.,Sensors (Basel),"This paper presents a new muscle contraction (MC) sensor. This MC sensor is based on a novel principle whereby muscle tension is measured during muscle contractions. During the measurement, the sensor is fixed on the skin surface above the muscle, while the sensor tip applies pressure and causes an indentation of the skin and intermediate layer directly above the muscle and muscle itself. The force on the sensor tip is then measured. This force is roughly proportional to the tension of the muscle. The measurement is non-invasive and selective. Selectivity of MC measurement refers to the specific muscle or part of the muscle that is being measured and is limited by the size of the sensor tip. The sensor is relatively small and light so that the measurements can be performed while the measured subject performs different activities. Test measurements with this MC sensor on the biceps brachii muscle under isometric conditions (elbow angle 90°) showed a high individual linear correlation between the isometric force and MC signal amplitudes (0.97 ≤ r ≤ 1). The measurements also revealed a strong correlation between the MC and electromyogram (EMG) signals as well as good dynamic behaviour by the MC sensor. We believe that this MC sensor, when fully tested, will be a useful device for muscle mechanic diagnostics and that it will be complementary to existing methods.",2011,11,10,9411-25,10.3390/s111009411,#2671,ÄorÄeviÄ 2011,biomechanics
28,16154420.0,Density and hydration of fresh and fixed human skeletal muscle.,J Biomech,"The maximum tetanic tension of skeletal muscle (P(0)) is often estimated based on calculation of physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). PCSA depends on muscle volume, pennation angle, and fiber length. Studies documenting PCSA in fixed human muscles usually compute muscle volume by dividing muscle mass by density. These studies use a density value of 1.0597 g/cm(3), which was originally based on unfixed rabbit and canine muscle tissue. Due to the dehydration effects of different fixation methods, the variable hydration that occurs when fixed tissue is stored in buffered saline, and the potential for species-specific muscle density, this value may be incorrect and an accurate value for fixed human muscle density is needed. To obtain an accurate density and water content values, 4% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) and 37% formaldehyde-fixed (n=54) cadaveric human muscle samples were divided into 6 groups (0, 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30 h) for hydration in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Measurements of volume, water content, and mass were made enabling calculation of muscle density. Additionally, water content was measured in living muscle (n=4) to determine the appropriate hydration time in PBS. Comparisons among groups demonstrated a significant increase in muscle water content and muscle volume over time, reaching living tissue levels after 24h, but, interestingly, the hydration process did not affect muscle density. These data yield a density value (mean+/-SE) of 1.112+/-0.006 g/cm(3) in 4% formaldehyde-fixed muscle and 1.055+/-0.006 g/cm(3) in 37% formaldehyde-fixed muscle. These results indicate that the use of inappropriate hydration times or density values can produce PCSA errors of 5-10%.",2005,38,11,2317-20,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.10.001,#2673,Ward 2005,
29,18372305.0,Physiological properties of human diaphragm muscle fibres and the effect of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,J Physiol,"The contractile and actomyosin ATPase properties of single fibres were examined in human diaphragm muscle obtained from patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Costal diaphragm biopsies were taken from five patients without evidence of COPD and from 11 age-matched individuals with varying degrees of the disease. Our aim was to establish whether changes in contractile properties of COPD diaphragm could be fully explained by the previously documented shift towards a greater proportion of type I myosin heavy chain isoform in COPD. The relative proportion of type I diaphragm fibres from non-COPD and COPD patients was measured by gel electrophoresis, and was negatively correlated with FEV(1) over the full range of values investigated. There was also significant atrophy of the type I fibre population in COPD diaphragms. Isometric tension was similar among the fibre types and between the COPD and non-COPD patients. The intrinsic energetic properties of diaphragm fibres were examined by monitoring the time-resolved actomyosin ATPase activity in COPD and non-COPD fibres that produced similar isometric forces. The isometric ATPase rate in COPD fibres was reduced to 50% of the rate in non-COPD fibres; hence, the cost of isometric contraction in type I and type IIA COPD fibres was reduced to between one-third and one-half of the tension cost calculated for non-COPD fibres. The rate of force development in type I COPD fibres was reduced to 50% of the rate seen in non-COPD type-I fibres. No difference in the rate of ATP consumption between COPD and non-COPD fibres was evident during isovelocity shortening. These data extend previous findings showing that aspects of breathing mechanics during progressive COPD are associated with remodelling of the diaphragm fibre-type distribution; on top of the increase in type I fibres there are fibre-specific reductions in force development rate (type I fibres) and ATPase rate that are consistent with the impairment of cross-bridge cycling kinetics.",2008,586,10,2637-50,10.1113/jphysiol.2007.149799,#2674,Stubbings 2008,

Recent reports have indicated the presence of PDE isoenzymes 1, 2, 4, and 5 in cytosolic supernatants prepared from human ureteral smooth muscle homogenates and the ability of second-generation inhibitors of PDE 3, 4, and 5 to relax KCl-induced tension of human ureteral muscle in vitro. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the functional effects of recently developed, third-generation isoenzyme-selective PDE inhibitors, the nitric oxide (NO)-donating agents sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and dihydropyridine (DHP), which is also described as an antagonist of L-type calcium channels, and the adenylyl cyclase-stimulating drug forskolin on tissue tension and cyclic nucleotide levels of human ureteral smooth muscle segments in vitro. Relaxant responses of human ureteral smooth muscle were investigated in vitro using the organ bath technique. Cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP were determined by specific radioimmunoassay following time and dose-dependent incubation of the ureteral tissue with the drugs. The most pronounced relaxing effects on KCl-induced tension of ureteral smooth muscle were exerted by nitrovasodilator SNP, PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, and PDE5 inhibitors E 4021 and morpholinosulfonyl-pyrazolopyrimidine (MSPP). Relaxing potency of the drugs was paralleled by their ability to elevate intracellular levels of cGMP and cAMP, respectively.

Mechanical and Neuromuscular Factors.,Int J Sports Med,"This two-part narrative review aims to provide an insight into the age-related mechanical and neuromuscular factors contributing to: (1) decreased maximal muscle strength and power; (2) decreased force control; and (3) increased fatigability. Structural and functional changes from the macro-level of the muscle-tendon unit to the micro-level of the single muscle fibre have been reviewed and are described. At the muscle-tendon unit level, muscle volume, thickness and cross-sectional area, as well as pennation angle and fascicle length all decrease as part of the natural ageing process. These changes negatively affect muscle quality, muscle and tendon stiffness and Young's modulus and account for impairment in motor performance. A progressive age-related alteration in neuromuscular function is also well-established, with reduction in number and firing rate of the motor unit, contractile velocity and specific tension of muscle fibres, and stability of neuromuscular junction. These could be the result of structural alterations in the: (i) motor neuron, with number reduced, size and collateral sprouting increased; (ii) neuromuscular junction, with decreased post-synaptic junctional fold and density of active zones and increased pre-synaptic branching and post-synaptic area; and (iii) muscle fibre, with decreased number and size and increased type I and co-expression of myosin heavy chain.",2020,41,11,709-719,10.1055/a-1144-3408,#2681,Wu 2020,
33,32178916.0,"Associations between Teachers' Posture, Muscle Tension and Voice Complaints.",J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: The interaction between muscle tension, posture, and vocal use is very complex as clinical research suggests that abnormal laryngeal posture can be associated with muscle adaptive changes, although specific evidence concerning body posture and voice disorders has been lacking. Thus, the aim of this study was to verify if there were differences in posture, muscle tension and voice between teachers with and without voice complaints. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Twenty-four teachers, 6 males and 18 females, were submitted to photogrammetry, muscle tension assessed trough palpation and algometry assessment. Aerodynamic assessment of voice, acoustic and auditory-perceptual analysis of voice were done. Participants were divided into without voice complaints group (WVCG; n = 11) and voice complaints group (VCG; n = 13) based on Sociodemographic and Clinical Questionnaire completion. RESULTS: For auditory-perceptual analysis, VCG showed a significant higher values on GRBASH subscales Grade (p < 0.001) and Roughness (p = 0.011). The VCG showed statistically significant higher values on muscle tension of suprahyoids (p = 0.001), thyrohyoids (P = 0009) and cricothyroids muscles (p = 0.040) and statistically significant lower values on algometry of the cricothyroid (p = 0.023 left and p = 0.026 right), suprahyoids (p = 0.017 left & p = 0.018 right), thyrohyoids (p = 0.006 left and p = 0.007 right) and pharyngolaryngeal (p = 0.016 left and p = 0.021 right) muscles of both sides. Concerning the aerodynamic assessment of voice and acoustic analysis of voice, no statistically significant differences between the groups were found.

Twenty-eight female subjects with relatively frequent headaches were divided into 4 groups, according to a 2 x 2 design. The independent variables were (1) Target response (to maintain elevated levels of either frontalis EMG or digital temperature for 40 min), and (2) Expectation (either specifically of a headache or of some unspecified discomfort). Dependent variables included headache as well as a number of other possible symptoms. Results showed that subjects were successful in complying with their assigned tasks. However, there were no main effects of Target response or Expectation and no interactions of these factors with respect to headache or any other symptom.

37,21370677.0,Differential vibratory characteristics of adductor spasmodic dysphonia and muscle tension dysphonia on high-speed digital imaging.,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to quantify disorder-specific signature kinematic disturbances of vibratory motion in adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD) and muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), in voice disturbances of a severe nature, with the use of high-speed digital imaging (HSDI). A secondary hypothesis of the study was to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the signature kinematic features obtained from HSDI, in differentiating between AdSD and MTD. METHODS: We used vibratory features from automated extraction of vocal fold motion waveforms and glottal cycle montage analysis from HSDI for differential kinematic profiling of AdSD and MTD. RESULTS: Novel features of motion irregularities and micromotions (as small as 27 ms) were greater in number for AdSD, whereas reduced motion irregularities, absence of oscillatory breaks, absence of micromotions, and increased hyperfunction characterized the MTD group. Oscillatory breaks (as small as 8 ms), although present only in the AdSD group, were not statistically significant because of their reduced number of occurrences compared to the other features. Further montage analysis of successive glottal cycles of oscillatory breaks in the AdSD group revealed 3 different kinematic patterns within the AdSD group, indicative of likely AdSD with: 1) possible predominant thyroarytenoid muscle involvement, 2) possible predominant cricothyroid muscle involvement, and 3) possible combined involvements of the thyroarytenoid and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles. Four consistent but unique kinematic patterns were identified within the MTD group: 1) diplophonia, 2) vocal fry, 3) breathy phonation, and 4) pressed phonation. Sensitivity and specificity analysis revealed that only motion irregularity was a significant predictor of the presence of AdSD. CONCLUSIONS: Fine kinematic analysis from HSDI can be used to aid detailed clinical profiling of the source characteristics of AdSD and MTD.",2011,120,1,21-32,10.1177/000348941112000104,#2688,Patel 2011,
38,27742497.0,Validity and Reliability of Surface Electromyography in the Assessment of Primary Muscle Tension Dysphonia.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the reliability and the discriminative validity of surface electromyography (sEMG) in the assessment of patients with primary muscle tension dysphonia (MTD). STUDY DESIGN: The study design is cross-sectional. METHODS: Fifteen patients with primary MTD (mean age: 34.07 ± 10.99 years) and 15 healthy volunteers (mean age: 34.53 ± 10.63 years) were included. All participants underwent evaluation of sEMG to record the electrical activity of the thyrohyoid and cricothyroid muscles. The outcome measures were the root mean square (RMS), activity peak, duration, and time to the peak activity, which were obtained during /a/ and /i/ prolongation for test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The test-retest reliability was good to excellent for the RMS and peak activity measures (intraclass correlation coefficient [agreement] [ICC(agreement)] = 0.49-0.98). The reliability for the activity duration was poor to excellent (ICC(agreement) = 0.19-0.9). Poor test-retest reliability was found for the time to peak measure (ICC(agreement) = 0.15-0.37). The standard error of measurement for all sEMG measures was between 0.41 and 2.05. The smallest detectable change (SDC) was calculated between 1.13 and 5.66. The highest SDC values were obtained for the peak and the lowest SDCs were documented for the duration (5.66 and 1.13, respectively). All sEMG measures were not able to discriminate between the MTD patients and healthy subjects (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The sEMG is a reliable tool to measure the RMS, the peak activity, and the activity duration in primary MTD. However, it is not able to discriminate the patients with primary MTD from healthy subjects.",2017,31,3,386.e9-386.e17,10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.09.010,#2689,Khoddami 2017,Assessment
39,25320205.0,Effect of supraspinatus tendon injury on supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle passive tension and associated biochemistry.,J Bone Joint Surg Am,"BACKGROUND: Injury to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons and the associated atrophic changes to the muscle remain a common clinical problem. Specifically, increased muscle stiffness has been implicated in failure of the repair and poor functional outcomes. We present a comparison of the passive mechanical properties and associated biochemical studies from patients with and without torn supraspinatus tendons. METHODS: Muscle biopsy samples (n = 40) were obtained from twenty patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Passive mechanical tests of both individual fibers and fiber bundles as well as analysis of titin molecular weight and collagen content were performed. RESULTS: At the fiber-bundle level, a significant increase in passive modulus was observed between intact supraspinatus samples (mean [and standard error], 237.41 ± 59.78 kPa) and torn supraspinatus samples (515.74 ± 65.48 kPa) (p < 0.05), a finding that was not observed at the single fiber level. Within the torn samples, elastic moduli in the supraspinatus were greater than in the infraspinatus at both the single fiber and the fiber-bundle level. There was a significant positive correlation between bundle elastic modulus and collagen content (r(2) = 0.465) in the supraspinatus muscle as well as a significant positive correlation between tear size and bundle elastic modulus (r(2) = 0.702) in the torn supraspinatus samples. CONCLUSIONS: Supraspinatus muscle passive tension increases in a tendon tear size-dependent manner after tendon injury. The increase in muscle stiffness appears to originate outside the muscle cell, in the extracellular matrix. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Muscle stiffness after rotator cuff tendon injury is more severe with large tears. This finding supports the concept of early intervention, when tendon tears are smaller, and interventions targeting the extracellular matrix.",2014,96,20,e175,10.2106/JBJS.M.01315,#2690,Silldorff 2014,
40,2396352.0,Effects of papaverine on human isolated bladder muscle.,Urol Res,"Papaverine is a non-specific smooth muscle relaxant and is thought to act at a site beyond the receptor sites on the cell membrane. In this study the relaxing properties of papaverine were tested in isolated muscle strips from the human bladder dome. In carbachol-induced contractions papaverine, even in high concentrations of 10(-4) mol/l had virtually no effects on peak tension generation, whereas the fading was accelerated and the steady state tension at 30 min. was reduced by about 54%. In contrast, high potassium-induced contractions were relaxed by papaverine in a concentration-dependent way; a concentration of papaverine of 10(-4) mol/l produced full relaxation. These findings might possibly be explained if it is assumed that papaverine blocks calcium ion channels in the cell membrane. However, the observation that rather high concentrations of papaverine were necessary to fully relax high potassium contractions and the fact, that papaverine affects cellular cAMP levels separate this drug from more selective calcium channel blockers. The calcium movements responsible for the peak tension generation in carbachol-induced contractions are obviously not affected by papaverine. Although papaverine had little effect on carbachol-induced contractions in vitro it cannot be excluded that the drug is effective in diseases were non-cholinergic mechanisms are involved.",1990,18,3,227-31,10.1007/BF00295853,#2691,Hertle 1990,

Besides α1-adrenoceptors, prostate smooth muscle contraction is induced by activation of thromboxane (TXA2) receptors (TXA2-R). Here, we examined the effects of the TXA2-R antagonist picotamide on contraction of human prostate tissue. Prostate tissues were obtained from radical prostatectomy. The effects of picotamide (300 μM), L-665,240 (3 μM), and seratrodast (3 μM) on U46619-, electric field stimulation- (EFS-), phenylephrine-, and norepinephrine-induced contractions were studied in organ baths. Expression of TXA2-R and TXA2 synthase (TXS) was examined by fluorescence stainings. Picotamide, seratrodast, and L-655,240 inhibited concentration-dependent contractions induced by the TXA2 analog U46619. Picotamide, but not seratrodast or L-655,240, inhibited frequency-dependent contractions induced by EFS. Picotamide inhibited concentration-dependent contractions induced by norepinephrine or by the selective α1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. In prostate strips, where only submaximal contraction by a low dose of phenylephrine was induced, application of U46619 raised tone to maximum phenylephrine-induced tension. Immunoreactivity for TXA2-R and TXS was observed in the stroma and in epithelial cells of glands. Colocalization of both immunoreactivites was observed with the smooth muscle markers calponin and α-smooth muscle actin, with the epithelial marker pan-cytokeratin, and with prostate-specific antigen in the stroma and glands. The receptor antagonist picotamide inhibits α1-adrenergic, TXA2-mediated, and EFS-induced contractions in the human prostate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first antagonist able to inhibit two different contraction systems in the prostate.",2013,305,10,F1383-90,10.1152/ajprenal.00380.2013,#2692,Hennenberg 2013,benign prostate hyperplasia

Intraword phonatory breaks have been offered as the sine qua non of ADSD, however, little is known regarding the presence of phonatory breaks in MTD. This investigation assessed the diagnostic worth of acoustic analysis of phonatory breaks as a possible objective test to distinguish ADSD from MTD. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control comparison. METHODS: Voice samples from patients with confirmed ADSD (n = 41) and MTD (n = 59) were analyzed acoustically to determine the presence, frequency, and duration of phonatory breaks -- defined as complete interruption of phonation within a word. Estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and likelihood ratios were calculated to determine the precision and worth of phonatory break analysis as a clinical diagnostic test. RESULTS: 1) Individuals with ADSD showed a significantly higher number of phonatory breaks as compared with MTD. 2) All measures of diagnostic precision varied according to both duration and frequency of phonatory breaks, with separation of males and females leading to different diagnostic test performance results. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that phonatory break analysis offers promise as an objective test to distinguish ADSD from MTD, with respectable diagnostic precision, especially among men.

43,29301317.0,Correction of Malocclusion by Botulinum Neurotoxin Injection into Masticatory Muscles.,Toxins (Basel),"Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a neurotoxin, and its injection in masticatory muscles induces muscle weakness and paralysis. This paralytic effect of BTX induces growth retardation of the maxillofacial bones, changes in dental eruption and occlusion state, and facial asymmetry. Using masticatory muscle paralysis and its effect via BTX, BTX can be used for the correction of malocclusion after orthognathic surgery and mandible fracture. The paralysis of specific masticatory muscles by BTX injection reduces the tensional force to the mandible and prevents relapse and changes in dental occlusion. BTX injection in the anterior belly of digastric and mylohyoid muscle prevents the open-bite and deep bite of dental occlusion and contributes to mandible stability after orthognathic surgery. The effect of BTX injection in masticatory muscles for maxillofacial bone growth and dental occlusion is reviewed in this article. The clinical application of BTX is also discussed for the correction of dental malocclusion and suppression of post-operative relapse after mandibular surgery.",2018,10,1,,10.3390/toxins10010027,#2694,Seok 2018,botulinum neurotoxin
44,16637869.0,Adaptability of elderly human muscles and tendons to increased loading.,J Anat,"Senile sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass associated with aging, is one of the main causes of muscle weakness and reduced locomotor ability in old age. Although this condition is mainly driven by neuropathic processes, nutritional, hormonal and immunological factors, as well as a reduction in physical activity, contribute to this phenomenon. Sarcopenia alone, however, does not fully account for the observed muscle weakness, as the loss of force is greater than that accounted for by the decrease in muscle size. As a consequence, a reduction in the force per unit area, both at single fibre and at whole muscle level, is observed. We recently suggested that at whole muscle level, this reduction in intrinsic force is the result of the combined effect of changes in (1) muscle architecture, (2) tendon mechanical properties, (3) neural drive (reduced agonist and increased antagonist muscle activity) and (4) single fibre-specific tension. Whereas several studies support the role of the last two factors in the loss of intrinsic muscle force with aging, alterations in muscle architecture and in tendon mechanical properties have also been shown to contribute to the above phenomenon. Indeed, sarcopenia of the human plantarflexors, represented by a 25% reduction in muscle volume, was found to be associated with a 10% reduction in fibre fascicle length and 13% reduction in pennation angle. These architectural alterations were accompanied by a 10% decrease in tendon stiffness, attributable to alterations in tendon material properties, as suggested by a 14% decrease in Young's modulus. Most of these changes may be reversed by 14 weeks of resistive training; both fibre fascicle length and tendon stiffness were found to be increased by 10 and 64%, respectively. Surprisingly, however, training had no effect on the estimated relative length-tension properties of the muscle, indicating that the effects of greater tendon stiffness and increased fascicle length cancelled out each other. It seems that natural strategies may be in place to ensure that the relative operating range of muscle remains unaltered by changes in physical activity, in old age.",2006,208,4,433-43,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2006.00548.x,#2695,Narici 2006,
45,12215855.0,Possible role of bioactive peptides in the regulation of human detrusor smooth muscle - functional effects in vitro and immunohistochemical presence.,World J Urol,"Results from basic research implicate a role for bioactive peptides in controlling the mammalian lower urinary tract. Although various peptides are assumed to be involved in the potentiaton or inhibition of cholinergic or purinergic activity in the urinary bladder, there is still much controversy regarding the mode of action and functional significance of such peptides in detrusor smooth muscle. Thus, we evaluated the functional effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), endothelin 1 (ET-1), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on isolated strip preparations of human detrusor smooth muscle and determined the presence of those peptides in the human detrusor by means of immunohistochemistry. The effects of peptides on isometric tension of isolated detrusor strip preparations and on tissue levels of cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP were compared to those of adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (F), nitric oxide donor Na(+)-nitroprusside (SNP) and non-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor papaverine (P). The effects of the compounds on isometric tension of isolated human detrusor smooth muscle were examined using the organ bath technique. To determine time- and dose-dependent effects on cyclic nucleotide levels, bladder strips were exposed to increasing doses of F, SNP, P, ANP, CGRP and VIP, then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenised in the frozen state. cAMP and cGMP were extracted and assayed using specific radioimmunoassays. The presence of peptides was investigated by light microscopy using the Avidin-Biotin-Complex (ABC) method. F, P and VIP most effectively reversed the carbachol-induced tension of isolated human detrusor strips. Relaxing effects of ANP, CGRP and SNP were negligible. In contrast, ET-1 and SP elicited dose-dependent contractions of the tissue. The relaxing effects of F, P and VIP were accompanied by an increase in cAMP and cGMP levels, respectively. Light microscopy revealed positive immunostaining for CGRP, ET 1, VIP and SP in sections of the detrusor muscle coat. Our results suggest a possible importance of ET 1, SP and VIP in regulating detrusor smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. Even if a peptide is not synthesised, stored or released in a smooth muscle tissue and is, therefore, unable to reach its target cells under physiologic conditions, a functional effect on the tissue might be mediated by peptide-binding to specific cell surface receptors.",2002,20,4,244-9,10.1007/s00345-002-0287-y,#2696,Uckert 2002,
46,30521425.0,Titin as a force-generating muscle protein under regulatory control.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Titin has long been recognized as a mechanical protein in muscle cells that has a main function as a molecular spring in the contractile units, the sarcomeres. Recent work suggests that the titin spring contributes to muscle contraction in a more active manner than previously thought. In this review, we highlight this property, specifically the ability of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains of titin to undergo unfolding-refolding transitions when isolated titin molecules or skeletal myofibrils are held at physiological force levels. Folding of titin Ig domains under force is a hitherto unappreciated, putative source of work production in muscle cells, which could work in synergy with the actomyosin system to maximize the energy delivered by a stretched, actively contracting muscle. This review also focuses on the mechanisms shown to modulate titin-based viscoelastic forces in skeletal muscle cells, including chaperone binding, titin oxidation, phosphorylation, Ca(2+) binding, and interaction with actin filaments. Along the way, we discuss which of these modulatory mechanisms might contribute to the phenomenon of residual force enhancement relevant for eccentric muscle contractions. Finally, a brief perspective is added on the potential for the alterations in titin-based force to dynamically alter mechano-chemical signaling pathways in the muscle cell. We conclude that titin from skeletal muscle is a determinant of both passive and active tension and a bona fide mechanosensor, whose stiffness is tuned by various independent mechanisms.",2019,126,5,1474-1482,10.1152/japplphysiol.00865.2018,#2697,Freundt 2019,active tension
47,2136977.0,Fiber-type specific caffeine sensitivities in normal human skinned muscle fibers.,Anesthesiology,"Caffeine sensitivity was studied in chemically skinned muscle fibers from vastus lateralis muscle obtained by biopsy during reconstructive knee surgery from 15 otherwise healthy young individuals. Muscle fiber type was determined by contracture occurring in strontium (slow-oxidative, type I fiber) or calcium (both type I and type II, fast glycolytic fiber) solutions and in several fibers after contracture testing by ATPase enzyme histochemistry. Caffeine sensitivity (mean +/- SD), defined as the threshold concentration inducing more than 10% of the maximal tension obtained with a calcium 3 x 10(-5) mM solution was 2.7 +/- 1.3 mM in 37 type I fibers, whereas it was 6.9 +/- 2.4 mM in 61 type II fibers. A paired t test showed a significantly increased sensitivity to caffeine in type I fibers (P less than 0.001) in 13 individuals in whom the two fiber types were identified. The mean (+/- SD) difference between type I and type II fibers was 4.1 +/- 1.9 mM. Type I fibers contracted with greater tension in response to the increasing concentration of caffeine than did type II fibers (P less than 0.05). These skinned fiber studies showed significantly different caffeine sensitivities between human type I and type II muscle fibers, as previously shown in animal muscles. The findings that human type I muscle fibers have higher caffeine sensitivity than type II muscle fibers should be helpful for the interpretation of the in vitro contracture test done in muscle strips containing type I and type II fibers in varying proportions.",1990,72,1,50-4,10.1097/00000542-199001000-00010,#2698,Mitsumoto 1990,
48,17174933.0,Human jaw and muscle modelling.,Arch Oral Biol,"Dynamic mathematical modelling is an invaluable method to help understand the biomechanics of the anatomically and functionally complex masticatory system. It provides insight into variables which are impossible to measure directly such as joint loads and individual muscle tensions, and into physical relationships between jaw structure and function. Individual parameters can be modified easily to understand their influence on function. Our models are constructed with best available structural and functional data, and evaluated against human jaw behaviour. Image data provide hard and soft tissue morphology and the jaw's inertial properties. The drive to the system is provided by actuators which simulate active and passive jaw muscle properties. In whole-jaw modelling, muscle models which behave plausibly rather than mimic the ultra-structural cross-bridge interactions are common since they are computationally feasible. Whole-jaw models have recently incorporated flexible finite-elements to explore tissue distortion in the temporomandibular joint and tongue movements. Furthermore, the jaw has been integrated with laryngeal models to explore complex tasks such as swallowing. These dynamic models have helped better understand joint loading, movement constraints and muscle activation strategies. Future directions will include further incorporation of rigid and flexible model dynamics and the creation of subject-specific models to better understand the functional implications of pathology.",2007,52,4,300-4,10.1016/j.archoralbio.2006.11.004,#2700,Peck 2007,
49,22436600.0,[The use of fibrolaryngoscopy in muscle tension dysphonia in telemarketers].,Acta Otorrinolaringol Esp,"INTRODUCTION: Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a voice disorder in the absence of current organic laryngeal pathology, without obvious psychogenic or neurological aetiology. The laryngeal features of MTD include a posterior glottal gap and supraglottic hyperfunctional activities; however, it remains unclear if these features are specific to MTD. This report aims to compare the laryngeal features in telemarketer patients with MTD versus non-dysphonic control subjects. METHODS: We reported on an observational, analytic and transversal study. Fiberoptic nasal endoscopy was performed on 57 patients (28 telemarketers with MTD and 29 control subjects). These random-sequence videotapes were independently rated by an expert laryngologist according to the modified Morrison and Rammage classification. In addition, a questionnaire about vocal symptoms and other details was completed. RESULTS: The posterior glottal gap was the most common feature in telemarketers with MTD, while incomplete glottal gap was observed more frequently in non-dysphonic patients. More than 70% of the videotapes were rated as pathologic. There was no statistical difference in the prevalence of normal features or bowing glottal gap between patients and control subjects. Anterior-posterior supraglottic contraction was more frequent in the control group. The major symptoms found were: voice gets tired quickly, increased vocal effort and neck tension. CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneity in the laryngeal features in telemarketers with MTD seen under fibroscopy and their presence among the non-dysphonic population suggest that they cannot determine by themselves the diagnosis of MTD.",2012,63,3,200-5,10.1016/j.otorri.2011.12.003,#2701,Paoletti 2012,
50,24495393.0,Aging related changes in determinants of muscle force generating capacity: a comparison of muscle aging in men and male rodents.,Ageing Res Rev,"Human aging is associated with a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and force generating capacity, however the exact mechanisms underlying these changes are not fully understood. Rodents models have often been used to enhance our understanding of mechanisms of age-related changes in human skeletal muscle. However, to what extent age-related alterations in determinants of muscle force generating capacity observed in rodents resemble those in humans has not been considered thoroughly. This review compares the effect of aging on muscle force generating determinants (muscle mass, fiber size, fiber number, fiber type distribution and muscle specific tension), in men and male rodents at similar relative age. It appears that muscle aging in male F344*BN rat resembles that in men most; 32-35-month-old rats exhibit similar signs of muscle weakness to those of 70-80-yr-old men, and the decline in 36-38-month-old rats is similar to that in men aged over 80 yrs. For male C57BL/6 mice, age-related decline in muscle force generating capacity seems to occur only at higher relative age than in men. We conclude that the effects on determinants of muscle force differ between species as well as within species, but qualitatively show the same pattern as that observed in men.",2014,14,,43-55,10.1016/j.arr.2014.01.005,#2703,Ballak 2014,Fiber number

Five healthy males [mean age 34.4 (SEM 2.2) years] performed strength training of the elbow flexors for 1 month, at altitude (A) (5050 m) and with the same absolute loads at sea level (SL), 8 months later. The EF cross-sectional area (CSA), determined at mid-arm by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, increased by 11.3 (SEM 3.7)% (P < 0.05) at A and 17.7 (SEM 4.5)% (P < 0.05) at SL. Isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) increased by 9.5 (SEM 2.6)% (P < 0.05) at A and 13.6 (SEM 2.4)% (P < 0.05) at SL. The CSA and MVC changes in A were significantly smaller than at SL (P < 0.05). Muscle specific tension did not change in either condition. No changes in muscle plus bone or MVC of the untrained, controlateral arm were observed. Thus, although there was no indication of muscle wasting at A, the hypertrophic response of skeletal muscle when trained in chronic hypoxia seemed to be significantly lower than that produced in normoxia. This effect could have arisen either from a direct depression of protein synthesis and/or hormonal changes provoked by hypoxia.",1995,70,3,213-9,10.1007/BF00238566,#2704,Narici 1995,
52,16931550.0,Fibre type-specific increase in passive muscle tension in spinal cord-injured subjects with spasticity.,J Physiol,"Patients with spasticity typically present with an increased muscle tone that is at least partly caused by an exaggerated stretch reflex. However, intrinsic changes in the skeletal muscles, such as altered mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix or the cytoskeleton, have been reported in response to spasticity and could contribute to hypertonia, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we examined the vastus lateralis muscles from spinal cord-injured patients with spasticity (n = 7) for their passive mechanical properties at three different levels of structural organization, in comparison to healthy controls (n = 7). We also assessed spasticity-related alterations in muscle protein expression and muscle ultrastructure. At the whole-muscle level in vivo, we observed increased passive tension (PT) in some spasticity patients particularly at long muscle lengths, unrelated to stretch reflex activation. At the single-fibre level, elevated PT was found in cells expressing fast myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms, especially MyHC-IIx, but not in those expressing slow MyHC. Type IIx fibres were present in higher than normal proportions in spastic muscles, whereas type I fibres were proportionately reduced. At the level of the isolated myofibril, however, there were no differences in PT between patients and controls. The molecular size of the giant protein titin, a main contributor to PT, was unchanged in spasticity, as was the titin : MyHC ratio and the relative desmin content. Electron microscopy revealed extensive ultrastructural changes in spastic muscles, especially expanded connective tissue, but also decreased mitochondrial volume fraction and appearance of intracellular amorphous material. Results strongly suggest that the global passive muscle stiffening in spasticity patients is caused to some degree by elevated PT of the skeletal muscles themselves. We conclude that this increased PT component arises not only from extracellular matrix remodelling, but also from structural and functional adaptations inside the muscle cells, which alter their passive mechanical properties in response to spasticity in a fibre type-dependent manner.",2006,577,Pt 1,339-52,10.1113/jphysiol.2006.116749,#2705,Olsson 2006,

54,8267041.0,Role of extracellular calcium and calcium channels in the response of human placental venous smooth muscle to endothelin-1.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the role of calcium and calcium channels in endothelin-1-induced contraction of the smooth muscle of human placental veins. STUDY DESIGN: Placentas were collected after vaginal delivery at term. After their removal from the chorionic plate, placental veins were divided into rings that were suspended in organ chambers and stretched to optimal tension. In the first part of the study, vessels from six women were initially suspended in calcium-poor modified Krebs-Ringer solution. They were then treated with either EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid; calcium chelator, 0.5 mmol/L] or calcium chloride 2.5 mmol/L (control). Endothelin-1 was then added cumulatively (10(-10) to 10(-7) mol/L), and the resulting changes in isometric tensions were recorded. In the second part of the study vessels from six other women were treated with either (1) normal modified Krebs-Ringers solution (control), (2) calcium-poor modified Krebs-Ringers solution, or (3) nicardipine (dihydropyridine calcium channel inhibitor, 10(-7) mol/L) in separate organ chambers. Endothelin-1 was then added cumulatively. RESULTS: Endothelin-1 produced concentration-dependent contractions in placental veins, with maximal tension reached at 10(-7) mol/L. Substitution of calcium-poor for standard Krebs-Ringers solution in the organ chamber abolished contractions to low endothelin-1 concentrations (< or = 10(-9) mol/L, p < 0.001) but did not affect the contractile response to higher concentrations. EGTA abolished contractions to all concentrations tested (p < 0.02). Nicardipine significantly, but incompletely, inhibited the contractile responses to all endothelin-1 concentrations tested (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Endothelin-1 induces contraction of the smooth muscle of human placental veins, which requires the influx of extracellular calcium. Dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels represent a major route of entry, but other pathways participate. The fetal effects of nifedipine and other calcium-channel blockers deserve specific evaluation in intrauterine growth retardation and other pregnancies complicated by elevated fetal levels of endothelin-1.",1993,169,6,1427-30,10.1016/0002-9378(93)90413-d,#2707,Le 1993,
55,31851953.0,Variability of concentric angle-specific isokinetic torque and impulse assessments of the knee extensors.,Physiol Meas,"OBJECTIVE: Length-tension relationships are widely reported in research, rehabilitation and performance settings; however, several isometric contractions at numerous angles are needed to understand these muscular outputs. Perhaps a more efficient way to determine torque-angle characteristics is via isokinetic dynamometry; however, little is known about the variability of isokinetic measurements besides peak torque and optimal angle. This paper examines the variability of angle-specific isokinetic torque and impulse measures. APPROACH: Three sessions of concentric (60°·s(-1)) knee extensions were performed by both limbs of 32 participants. Assessments were repeated on three occasions, separated by 5-8 d. To quantify variability, the standardized typical error of measurement (TEM) was doubled and thresholds of 0.2-0.6 (small), 0.6-1.2 (moderate), 1.2-2.0 (large), 2.0-4.0 (very large) and  >4.0 (extremely large) were applied. Additionally, variability was deemed large when the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was  <0.67 and coefficient of variation (CV)  >  10%; moderate when ICC  >  0.67 or CV  <  10% (but not both); and small when both ICC  >  0.67 and CV  <  10%. MAIN RESULTS: Isokinetic torque and angular impulse show small to medium variability (ICC  =  0.75-0.96, CV  =  6.4%-15.3%, TEM  =  0.25-0.53) across all but the longest (100°) and shortest (10°) muscle lengths evaluated. However, moderate to large variability was found for the optimal angle (ICC  =  0.58-0.64, CV  =  7.3%-8%, TEM  =  0.76-0.86), and torque and impulse at the beginning and end of the range of motion (ICC  =  0.57-0.85, CV  =  11-42.9%, TEM  =  0.40-0.89). Intersession variability of isokinetic torque and impulse were small to moderate at medium (90-20°) joint angles. SIGNIFICANCE: Researchers and practitioners can examine the muscle torque-angle relationship and activity-specific torque outputs within these ranges, without resorting to more strenuous and time-consuming isometric evaluations.",2020,41,1,01NT02,10.1088/1361-6579/ab635e,#2708,Oranchuk 2020,

Skeletal muscle is detrimentally changed by normal aging but whether it is an affected tissue in progeria has not been resolved. We hypothesized that mice which mimic Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome would exhibit age-related alterations of skeletal muscle. Zmpste24 (-/-) and Zmpste24 (+/+) littermates were assessed for skeletal muscle functions, histo-morphological characteristics, and ankle joint mechanics. Twenty-four-hour active time, ambulation, grip strength, and whole body tension were evaluated as markers of neuromuscular performance, each of which was at least 33% lower in Zmpste24 (-/-) mice compared with littermates (p < 0.06). Contractile capacity of the posterior leg muscles were not affected in Zmpste24 (-/-) mice, but muscles of the anterior leg were 30-90% weaker than those of Zmpste24 (+/+) mice (p < 0.01). Leg muscles were 32-47% smaller in the Zmpste24 (-/-) mice and contained ~60% greater collagen relative to littermates (p < 0.01). Soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles of Zmpste24 (-/-) mice had excessive myonuclei and altered fiber size distributions but, otherwise, appeared normal. Ankle range of motion was 70% lower and plantar- and dorsiflexion passive torques were nearly 3-fold greater in Zmpste24 (-/-) than Zmpste24 (+/+) mice (p ≤ 0.01). The combined factors of muscle atrophy, collagen accumulation, and perturbed joint mechanics likely contributed to poor neuromuscular performance and selective muscle weakness displayed by Zmpste24 (-/-)mice. In summary, these characteristics are similar to those of aged mice indicating accelerated aging of skeletal muscle in progeria.",2012,34,4,805-19,10.1007/s11357-011-9281-x,#2709,Greising 2012,
57,2186236.0,Assessment of respiratory muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive lung disease.,Med Clin North Am,"In COLD, the inspiratory muscles are severely disadvantaged by virtue of the hyperinflation that accompanies this disorder. Such mechanical disadvantage will lead clinically, in the stable patient, to the active recruitment of the accessory muscles of inspiration and to a pattern of rapid, shallow breathing that may be due to either peripheral (muscle) or central (neurogenic) influences thought to be linked to a critical tension-time index of the inspiratory muscles. This pattern appears to be all the more pronounced in the patient with acute respiratory failure and is frequently accompanied by disordered rib cage-abdominal movements. While these movements may reflect the muscles' attempts to stave off fatigue, they may also imply that if the imposed mechanical stress is unrelieved, muscle failure will ensue. In the laboratory, mechanical disadvantage is marked by diminished inspiratory mouth pressures. Because of wide scatter, a low mouth pressure beyond that which can be explained by hyperinflation alone should be confirmed by an assessment of Pesosniff or by the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure. Muscle endurance, also compromised in this condition, can be assessed indirectly by the measurement of MVV or MSVC, or more directly by an invasive assessment of the tension-time index and endurance time of the diaphragm or noninvasively by the Endurance Index of McKenzie and Gandevia. And finally, once muscle failure is pending or has been established, a program of muscle rest, either complete or partial, pharmacotherapy, and goal-specific training should be instituted.",1990,74,3,643-60,10.1016/s0025-7125(16)30543-0,#2710,Goldberg 1990,
58,8317197.0,Functional morphology of force transmission in skeletal muscle. A brief review.,Acta Anat (Basel),"The work done by the contractile proteins of muscle in accelerating, decelerating, or maintaining the positions of skeletal elements requires the efficient transmission of tension across the surface membranes of the fibers. The most widely studied sites of tension transmission are the ends of muscle fibers where they contact either connective or epithelial tissues. In most animals, regardless of phylum, muscle fiber ends are characteristically folded, producing a junctional interface that significantly reduces the absolute value of stress applied to the cell membrane, insures that the principle stress vector at the cell membrane is shear rather than tension, and minimizes stress concentrations. The morphological and molecular similarities of muscle-tendon junctions (MTJs) in different animals suggest that the problem of creating a strong adhesive joint between a muscle fiber and a tissue of dissimilar physical properties is essentially the same for all muscles, and that the solution arose early in evolution. In addition to those muscle fiber ends that occur where fibers contact dissimilar tissues, there are intramuscular fiber terminations that consist either of folded cell-cell junctions similar to the fasciae adherentes of cardiac muscle, or of gradually tapering fiber ends. Both sorts of intramuscular ends occur in those vertebrate muscles in which the individual muscle fibers are too short to reach from the tendon of origin to the tendon of insertion. In series-fibered muscles in which the fiber ends are tapered, tension is transmitted from contractile proteins to endomysial collagen fibrils across the fiber membranes. The endomysium of such muscles is an essential series-elastic element. The existing evidence suggests that tension transmission is a general property of muscle cell surfaces, and that specific junctional morphologies are the results of dynamic interactions between muscle cells and the tissues to which they adhere.",1993,146,4,205-22,10.1159/000147459,#2711,Trotter 1993,
59,21115852.0,"Nebulin, a major player in muscle health and disease.",FASEB J,"Nebulin is a giant 600- to 900-kDa filamentous protein that is an integral component of the skeletal muscle thin filament. Its functions have remained largely nebulous because of its large size and the difficulty in extracting nebulin in a native state from muscle. Recent improvements in the field, especially the development of knockout mouse models deficient in nebulin (NEB-KO mice), indicate now that nebulin performs a surprisingly wide range of functions. In addition to a major role in thin-filament length specification, nebulin also functions in the regulation of muscle contraction, as indicated by the findings that muscle fibers deficient in nebulin have a higher tension cost, and develop less force due to reduced myofilament calcium sensitivity and altered crossbridge cycling kinetics. In addition, the function of nebulin extends to a role in calcium homeostasis. These novel functions indicate that nebulin might have evolved in vertebrate skeletal muscles to develop high levels of muscle force efficiently. Finally, the NEB-KO mouse models also highlight the role of nebulin in the assembly and alignment of the Z disks. Notably, rapid progress in understanding the roles of nebulin in vivo provides clinically important insights into how nebulin deficiency in patients with nemaline myopathy contributes to debilitating muscle weakness.",2011,25,3,822-9,10.1096/fj.10-157412,#2713,Labeit 2011,
60,27665350.0,Characterization of three dimensional volumetric strain distribution during passive tension of the human tibialis anterior using Cine Phase Contrast MRI.,J Biomech,"Intramuscular pressure correlates strongly with muscle tension and is a promising tool for quantifying individual muscle force. However, clinical application is impeded by measurement variability that is not fully understood. Previous studies point to regional differences in IMP, specifically increasing pressure with muscle depth. Based on conservation of mass, intramuscular pressure and volumetric strain distributions may be inversely related. Therefore, we hypothesized volumetric strain would decrease with muscle depth. To test this we quantified 3D volumetric strain in the tibialis anterior of 12 healthy subjects using Cine Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Cine Phase Contrast data were collected while a custom apparatus rotated the subjects' ankle continuously between neutral and plantarflexion. A T2-weighted image stack was used to define the resting tibials anterior position. Custom and commercial post-processing software were used to quantify the volumetric strain distribution. To characterize regional strain changes, the muscle was divided into superior-inferior sections and either medial-lateral or anterior-posterior slices. Mean volumetric strain was compared across the sections and slices. As hypothesized, volumetric strain demonstrated regional differences with a decreasing trend from the anterior (superficial) to the posterior (deep) muscle regions. Statistical tests showed significant main effects and interactions of superior-inferior and anterior-posterior position as well as superior-inferior and medial-lateral position on regional strain. These data support our hypothesis and imply a potential relationship between regional volumetric strain and intramuscular pressure. This finding may advance our understanding of intramuscular pressure variability sources and lead to more reliable measurement solutions in the future.",2016,49,14,3430-3436,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.09.002,#2714,Jensen 2016,Cine Phase Contrast
61,12535317.0,Satellite cells and training in the elderly.,Scand J Med Sci Sports,"In the present review, we describe the effects of ageing on human muscle fibres, underlining that each human muscle is unique, meaning that the phenotype becomes specifically changed upon ageing in different muscles, and that the satellite cells are key cells in the regeneration and growth of muscle fibres. Satellite cells are closely associated with muscle fibres, located outside the muscle fibre sarcolemma but beneath the basement lamina. They are quiescent cells, which become activated by stimulation, like muscle fibre injury or increased muscle tension, start replicating and are responsible for the repair of injured muscle fibres and the growth of muscle fibres. The degree of replication is governed by the telomeric clock, which is affected upon excessive bouts of degeneration and regeneration as in muscular dystrophies. The telomeric clock, as in dystrophies, does not seem to be a limiting factor in ageing of human muscle. The number of satellite cells, although reduced in number in aged human muscles, has enough number of cell divisions left to ensure repair throughout the human life span. We propose that an active life, with sufficient general muscular activity, should be recommended to reduce the impairment of skeletal muscle function upon ageing.",2003,13,1,48-55,10.1034/j.1600-0838.2003.20285.x,#2715,Thornell 2003,
62,10468663.0,The impact of biochemical methods for single muscle fibre analysis.,Acta Physiol Scand,"Biochemical methods for single muscle fibre analysis provide sensitive measures for elucidating muscle fibre heterogeneity. The understanding of the complexity of skeletal muscle fibres, initially based on qualitative histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, has been greatly expanded by quantitative micromethods, such as microphotometry and microbiochemical assays. Assessment of metabolic enzyme activity levels has revealed pronounced scattering within and between different fibre types and has highlighted the use of specific enzyme activity ratios as discriminative measures. With the exception of type I fibres, metabolic properties are loosely coupled with molecular properties of the myofibrillar apparatus. As such, myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms appear to be the best choice for fibre type delineation. Among the two available methods for MHC-based fibre type distinction, single fibre electrophoresis appears to be superior to immunohistochemistry. The electrophoretic separation of MHC isoforms in single fibres is quantitative and, as opposed to immunohistochemistry, yields important information on MHC isoform proportions in hybrid fibres. Histochemical staining for myofibrillar ATPase activity can, thus, be correlated in most cases with specific MHC isoform profiles. Single fibre studies have demonstrated a relationship between ATP phosphorylation potential and MHC isoform complement. This relationship corresponds to different tension costs and provides an additional rationale for the MHC-based fibre type diversity and transitions. The combination of reverse transcriptase (RT) with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has proved to be a highly sensitive tool and has extended single fibre analysis to the level of MHC mRNA isoforms. Application of RT-PCR techniques to single fibre fragments identified by their MHC protein isoform profile, provides insights at two levels of expression and, thus, has extended our knowledge on the plasticity of muscle and the dynamical state of muscle fibres.",1999,166,4,261-77,10.1046/j.1365-201x.1999.00568.x,#2716,Pette 1999,
63,6706740.0,Isometric or dynamic training: differential effects on mechanical properties of a human muscle.,J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol,"This work compares the specific effects of 3 mo of moderate, isometric, or dynamic voluntary exercises on the contractile properties of human adductor pollicis muscle. Isometric training consisted of 10 daily contractions of 5-s duration at the frequency of one contraction per minute. Dynamic training consisted of 10 daily series of 10 fast contractions (less than 0.5-s duration) moving a load of one-third of the maximal muscle strength at a frequency of one series per minute. Both training programs produced a concomitant increase in maximal tetanic tension and in peak rate of tension development (Ro). A larger increase (P less than 0.05) was found after isometric training (20 vs. 11% after dynamic exercises), whereas Ro augmented more (P less than 0.05) after dynamic contractions (31 vs. 18% after isometric training). Enhancements of twitch force (Pt), rates of twitch tension development (Rt), and of relaxation (St) were, respectively, 20, 20, and 12% after isometric training. There was no modification of contraction time and time of half relaxation (T 1/2R). Conversely, dynamic training produced increases of Rt (25%) and St (16%), associated with an apparently paradoxical decrease of Pt (10%) and reductions of contraction time (11%) and T 1/2R (9%). Maximal shortening velocity was only increased after dynamic training (21%), whereas the maximal muscle power presented a large increase (P less than 0.05) after isometric exercises (51 vs. 19% after dynamic exercises) and a shift of its optimal peak toward heavier loads. This study suggests that human muscle adapts differently to isometric or to dynamic training programs and provides evidence that its contractile kinetics can be altered by exercises performed in physiological conditions.",1984,56,2,296-301,10.1152/jappl.1984.56.2.296,#2717,Duchateau 1984,

This loss of muscle mass associated with ageing, is a main cause of muscle weakness, but the loss of muscle strength typically exceeds that of muscle size, with a resulting decrease in force per unit of muscle cross-sectional area. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to a reduction in neural drive and in fibre specific tension, changes in muscle architecture contribute significantly to the loss of muscle force through alterations in muscle mechanical properties. Older muscle, however, maintains a high degree of plasticity in response to increased loading since considerable hypertrophy and a reversal of the alterations in muscle architecture associated with ageing are observed with resistive training.",2004,4,2,161-4,,#2719,Narici 2004,
65,30170912.0,Muscle Tension Dysphonia: Which Laryngoscopic Features Can We Rely on for Diagnosis?,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is generally diagnosed through clinical history and physical examination. Several diagnostic or classification systems exist, such as those of Van Lawrence, Morrison-Rammage, and Koufman, that delineate MTD and distinguish subtypes on the basis of laryngoscopic features. The aim of this study is to determine which of the clinical features included in these classifications are most related to the aerodynamic profile of MTD. STUDY DESIGN: This is an analytic retrospective study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study evaluates a series of 30 consecutive patients, all over 18 years old, who attended the voice clinic consult of our department and were diagnosed with MTD. All subjects underwent fiberoptic nasal endoscopy, acoustic voice assessment, and aerodynamic voice assessment. The study only includes patients with a pathological aerodynamic profile. Presence or absence of each laryngoscopic feature in the full range of features in the Van Lawrence, Morrison-Rammage, and Koufman classification systems was evaluated independently by three experts. Cohen's kappa coefficient was calculated to indicate the degree of concordance between the experts. The chi-squared test was used to determine the degree of association between clinical features and mean value of the subglottic pressure peak (mmH(2)O). RESULTS: Clinical parameters that were found to have a statistically significant association (P < 0.05) with an alteration in mean subglottic pressure peak were those related to anteroposterior and lateral compression of the larynx in Van Lawrence, Morrison-Rammage, and Koufman classification systems. CONCLUSIONS: While several studies have sought to clarify the laryngoscopic features of MTD, the current study is the first to evaluate these features in subjects who have been objectively diagnosed by means of aerodynamic voice assessment. The laryngoscopic features most strongly related to an aerodynamic profile of MTD were anteroposterior compression of the larynx, lateral compression of the larynx, and vestibular fold contribution to phonation.",2019,33,5,812.e15-812.e18,10.1016/j.jvoice.2018.04.015,#2720,Garaycochea 2019,Aerodynamics

METHODS: We included 21 MTD participants exhibiting both vocal roughness and supraglottic compression, who were able to produce successful humming and um-hum phonation. Twenty nondysphonic participants were selected as controls. Each participant was instructed to perform three phonatory tasks: natural phonation, humming phonation without pitch changes, and subsequent um-hum phonation, that is, humming with a pitch glide up as if agreeing with someone. Acoustic and EGG signals were recorded while the participants performed these tasks. Computed parameters reflecting the irregularities in vocal fold vibrations and the degree of glottal contact were calculated and compared between the tasks. RESULTS: The MTD group showed decreases in both perceptual vocal roughness and acoustic perturbation parameters while performing the tasks. The perturbation parameters of EGG signals and the standard deviation of the contact quotient (CQ) also exhibited significant decreases associated with either of humming or um-hum phonation in both groups. In addition, the CQ exhibited significant increases following humming alone in the MTD group and the combination of humming and um-hum phonation in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the combination of humming without pitch changes and subsequent um-hum phonation have the immediate effect in adjusting the regularity of vocal fold vibration and augmenting the degree of glottal contact in MTD patients as well as nondysphonic speakers, whereas humming alone increases the degree of glottal contact in MTD patients.",2014,28,6,733-41,10.1016/j.jvoice.2014.02.004,#2721,Ogawa 2014,Contact quotient

In vitro relaxant responses of human ureteral smooth muscle to the PDE5 inhibitors mentioned above were investigated using the organ bath technique. Cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP were determined by means of specific radioimmunoassay following incubation of the tissue with Sil, Var, Tad and SNP. The tension induced by KCl of the ureteral tissue was dose dependently reversed by the drugs with the following rank order of efficacy: SNP > Var >or= Sil > Tad > BSC. R(max) values ranged from 25 +/- 9% (SNP) to 5 +/- 3% (BSC). Relaxant responses were paralleled by threefold to fourfold increase in tissue levels of cGMP. Our results indicate that PDE5 inhibitors can reverse the tension of isolated human ureteral smooth muscle via cGMP-mediated pathways.

68,12061084.0,Clinical neurokinesiology of spastic gait.,Bratisl Lek Listy,"Locomotor control requires a spatiotemporal coordination of passive and active forces across the movement system. Both anticipatory and reactive strategies operate in locomotor control. Mammalian locomotion is based on a rhythmic, ""pacemaker"" activity of spinal stepping generators. Reflex modification of the gait cycle is task-, context- and especially phase-dependent. In spasticity, together with disturbed supraspinal control, the phase-dependent reflex modulation of the gait cycle is severely impaired and there is altered modulation and timing of muscle activation and relaxation during voluntary movement. There is also a poor correlation between EMG activity and tension development in the spastic muscle. The tension increases without sufficient muscle activation and disconnection and dyscoordination between muscle activation, tension development and motor performance develops. The pattern of muscle activation and the development of increased muscle tone in patients with spasticity may be dramatically different in active movement from that observed in clinical testing of the passive muscles. Strategies used in the functional treatment of spasticity should be aimed at training and activating residual motor function, suppression of pathological and unfavourable movement and postural patterns and preventing secondary complications. In the 1990s a number of new specific instrumental methods and technical equipment supporting gait rehabilitation in patients with CNS lesions were developed: rhythmic auditory stimulation and other types of rhythmic stimulation, partial body support, usually with treadmill walking, complex orthotic support of bipedal locomotion, multichannel functional electrical stimulation, usually with programmable computer control, and advanced gait trainers. In therapy of spastic gait, the functional goals should be clearly determined from the kinesiological point of view of the impairment, and the impact on disability and handicap should be considered and a multidisciplinary approach is essential.

Partial compared to full range of motion resistance training for muscle hypertrophy: A brief review and an identification of potential mechanisms. J Strength Cond Res 32(9): 2661-2673, 2018-Resistance training promotes skeletal muscle hypertrophy; there are specific recommendations of intensity, volume, and duration that appear to facilitate hypertrophy the greatest. However, currently, there is not a definitive consensus on optimal range of motion. It appears that the partial range of motion (pROM) mode of exercise may have some similar benefit on muscle hypertrophy as the conventional full range of motion (fROM). Because of the dynamic and multiplanar movement pattern of a multijoint resistance exercise, there may be variation in human force-length and strength-curve theories, which may influence optimal muscle force production at differing portions of a fROM. This suggests specific muscle groups may potentially be optimally recruited during a specific portion of the exercise. The majority of previous research has primarily focused on strength outcomes opposed to muscle hypertrophy. The purpose of this brief review is to highlight the limited and relative pROM literature on muscle hypertrophy and some potential pROM mechanisms that require investigation to assess any plausible relationships. Some potential mechanisms and outcomes of interest are muscle time under tension, muscle activation, and nonuniform hypertrophy. This mode of resistance exercise requires further evaluation on hypertrophic responses; if proven efficacious, it may be employed to those in rehabilitative environments and those that seek more specific regional, local hypertrophic responses such as physique competitors.",2018,32,9,2652-2664,10.1519/JSC.0000000000002723,#2724,Newmire 2018,
70,23946147.0,Automated acoustic analysis of task dependency in adductor spasmodic dysphonia versus muscle tension dysphonia.,Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Distinguishing muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) from adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) can be difficult. Unlike MTD, ADSD is described as ""task-dependent,"" implying that dysphonia severity varies depending upon the demands of the vocal task, with connected speech thought to be more symptomatic than sustained vowels. This study used an acoustic index of dysphonia severity (i.e., the Cepstral Spectral Index of Dysphonia [CSID]) to: 1) assess the value of ""task dependency"" to distinguish ADSD from MTD, and to 2) examine associations between the CSID and listener ratings. STUDY DESIGN: Case-Control Study. METHODS: CSID estimates of dysphonia severity for connected speech and sustained vowels of patients with ADSD (n = 36) and MTD (n = 45) were compared. The diagnostic precision of task dependency (as evidenced by differences in CSID-estimated dysphonia severity between connected speech and sustained vowels) was examined. RESULTS: In ADSD, CSID-estimated severity for connected speech (M = 39. 2, SD = 22.0) was significantly worse than for sustained vowels (M = 29.3, SD = 21.9), [P = .020]. Whereas in MTD, no significant difference in CSID-estimated severity was observed between connected speech (M = 55.1, SD = 23.8) and sustained vowels (M = 50.0, SD = 27.4), [P = .177]. CSID evidence of task dependency correctly identified 66.7% of ADSD cases (sensitivity) and 64.4% of MTD cases (specificity). CSID and listener ratings were significantly correlated. CONCLUSION: Task dependency in ADSD, as revealed by differences in acoustically-derived estimates of dysphonia severity between connected speech and sustained vowel production, is a potentially valuable diagnostic marker.",2014,124,3,718-24,10.1002/lary.24362,#2725,Roy 2014,ADSD

This investigation examined the precision of response to unilateral lidocaine block of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN block) as a potential diagnostic test to discriminate ADSD from MTD. METHODS: Patients with ADSD (n = 23) and MTD (n = 20) were audio-recorded before and during RLN block. The patients completed self-ratings of dysphonia severity, vocal effort, and laryngeal tightness, and blinded listeners completed auditory-perceptual ratings of overall severity, breathiness, and strain of voice samples before and during the block. RESULTS: Repeated-measures analysis of variance, with ""group"" (ADSD/MTD) as the between-subjects variable and ""time"" (before block/during block) as the within-subjects variable, confirmed significant ""time"" effects, but no significant ""group-by-time"" interaction effects, indicating that both disorder groups responded favorably to RLN block, according to patient- and listener-based ratings. Furthermore, low estimates of sensitivity and specificity and weak receiver operating characteristic curves confirmed that a positive response to the RLN block test did not distinguish ADSD from MTD. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that RLN block offers little discriminatory value in the differential diagnosis of ADSD versus MTD, and a positive response to RLN block should not be considered confirmatory of ADSD.",2007,116,3,161-8,10.1177/000348940711600301,#2726,Roy 2007,
72,11086184.0,Tension and stretch receptors in gastrointestinal smooth muscle: re-evaluating vagal mechanoreceptor electrophysiology.,Brain Res Brain Res Rev,"Electrophysiological and morphological analyses of vagal mechanoreceptors in the gut wall suggest conflicting conclusions. Electrophysiology has distinguished a single general class of ending in smooth muscle, one characterized as an 'in series' tension receptor. Morphology, in contrast, has characterized two distinct specializations of vagal afferent endings in the muscle wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. These two structures differ in terms of their target tissues, terminal architectures and regional distributions; they also develop on different ontogenetic timetables and depend on different trophic support in the muscle wall. On the basis of these features, we have proposed that one of the putative mechanoreceptors, the intraganglionic laminar ending (IGLE), has characteristics of a tension receptor and the other, the intramuscular array (IMA), has features of a stretch or length receptor. In a functional analogy with striated muscle proprioceptors, IGLEs should have similarities to Golgi tendon organs, whereas IMAs should have equivalencies with muscle spindle afferents. The present survey re-examines the recording analyses in light of the structural observations. This review indicates that previous electrophysiological studies are too inconclusive to refute the inference that the vagus supplies two distinct types of mechanoreceptors to the muscle wall of the GI tract. Multiple methodological constraints and sources of variance have limited the resolution of electrophysiological experiments. Specifically, these experiments have conventionally used distension stimuli that confound tension and stretch. In addition, sampling strategies have biased recording experiments towards a focus on one type of ending, the IGLE. Furthermore, putative functional properties (e.g., broad tuning) of vagal mechanoreceptors suggest that distinguishing two recording patterns will require exacting protocols. Combining a recognition of the methodological difficulties that have limited electrophysiological analyses with an understanding of the structural features of the endings, however, suggests several critical electrophysiological experiments with the resolution to distinguish two classes of response profiles. Until such experiments can be conducted, sensory physiology's axiom that 'function varies with form', taken together with a re-assessment of the existing data, suggests that the vagus nerve supplies stretch receptors as well as tension receptors to the wall of the GI tract.",2000,34,2-Jan,26-Jan,10.1016/s0165-0173(00)00036-9,#2727,Phillips 2000,
73,32498422.0,Alterations of Extracellular Matrix Mechanical Properties Contribute to Age-Related Functional Impairment of Human Skeletal Muscles.,Int J Mol Sci,"Aging of human skeletal muscles is associated with increased passive stiffness, but it is still debated whether muscle fibers or extracellular matrix (ECM) are the determinants of such change. To answer this question, we compared the passive stress generated by elongation of fibers alone and arranged in small bundles in young healthy (Y: 21 years) and elderly (E: 67 years) subjects. The physiological range of sarcomere length (SL) 2.5-3.3 μm was explored. The area of ECM between muscle fibers was determined on transversal sections with picrosirius red, a staining specific for collagen fibers. The passive tension of fiber bundles was significantly higher in E compared to Y at all SL. However, the resistance to elongation of fibers alone was not different between the two groups, while the ECM contribution was significantly increased in E compared to Y. The proportion of muscle area occupied by ECM increased from 3.3% in Y to 8.2% in E. When the contribution of ECM to bundle tension was normalized to the fraction of area occupied by ECM, the difference disappeared. We conclude that, in human skeletal muscles, the age-related reduced compliance is due to an increased stiffness of ECM, mainly caused by collagen accumulation.",2020,21,11,,10.3390/ijms21113992,#2728,Pavan 2020,aging

Maximal knee extension torques were recorded at a specific joint angle (0.52 rad below the horizontal plane) for all test speeds. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: group A, control, n = 7; group B, training at 1.68 rad . s-1, n = 5; or group C, training at 4.19 rad . s-1, n = 5. Subjects trained the knee extensors by performing two sets of 10 single maximal voluntary efforts three times a week for 4 wk. Before training, each training group exhibited a leveling-off of muscular tension in the slow velocity-high force region of the in vivo force-velocity relationship. Training at 1.68 rad . s-1 resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) improvements at all velocities except for 5.03 rad . s-1 and markedly affected the leveling-off in the slow velocity-high force region. Training at 4.19 rad . s-1 did not affect the leveling-off phenomenon but brought about significant improvements (P less than 0.05) at velocities of 2.51, 3.35, and 4.19 rad . s-1.

75,9012751.0,The giant protein titin. Emerging roles in physiology and pathophysiology.,Circ Res,"Titin is a giant protein of vertebrate striated muscles (M(r), > or = 3000 kD). Its molecules are of filamentous shape and span from the Z disk to the M line, thereby forming a third filament system of the sarcomere. This filament system is important for both the structural integrity of the myofibril and the passive tension response of a stretched muscle fiber. The determination of the cDNA sequence of human cardiac titin has shown that the cardiac titin filament is formed by a single, giant. 27,000-residue-long polypeptide chain. The titin strand has a modular structure, and different modular arrangements are expressed in different muscle tissue types by differential splicing. In the A band, the titin modules provide regular arrays of binding sites for other sarcomeric proteins, thereby contributing to a precise assembly of myofibrillar proteins in vivo. In the I band, two specific motif families, tandem-immunoglobulin domains and PEVK-rich sequences, confer extensibility to the titin filament. Expression of muscle tissue-specific length variants of the PEVK region by alternative splicing may explain the differences in the passive tension properties between various striated muscle types. Apart from the titin sequences with apparent functions for muscle structure and elasticity, the titin molecule contains a class of unique sequence insertions. Among these sequences are phosphorylation sites, a serine/threonine kinase domain, and binding sites for muscle-specific calpain proteases. Thus, it is likely that the titin filament also plays a role in myofibrillar signal transduction pathways.",1997,80,2,290-4,10.1161/01.res.80.2.290,#2730,Labeit 1997,
76,24742529.0,Modeling length-tension properties of RCPm muscles during voluntary retraction of the head.,Man Ther,"Head retraction exercises are one of several commonly used clinical tools that are used to assess and treat patients with head and neck pain and to aid in restoration of a normal neutral head posture. Retraction of the head results in flexion of the occipitoatlantal (OA) joint and stretching of rectus capitis posterior minor (RCPm) muscles. The role that retraction of the head might have in treating head and neck pain patients is currently unknown. RCPm muscles arise from the posterior tubercle of the posterior arch of C1 and insert into the occipital bone inferior to the inferior nuchal line and lateral to the midline. RCPm muscles are the only muscles that attach to the posterior arch of C1. The functional role of RCPm muscles has not been clearly defined. The goal of this project was to develop a three-dimensional, computer-based biomechanical model of the posterior aspect of the OA joint. This model should help clarify why voluntary head retraction exercises seem to contribute to the resolution of head and neck pain and restoration of a normal head posture in some patients. The model documents that length-tension properties of RCPm muscles are significantly affected by variations in the physical properties of the musculotendonous unit. The model suggests that variations in the cross sectional area of RCPm muscles due to pathologies that weaken the muscle, such as muscle atrophy, may reduce the ability of these muscles to generate levels of force that are necessary for the performance of normal, daily activities. The model suggests that the main benefit of the initial phase of head retraction exercises may be to strengthen RCPm muscles through eccentric contractions, and that the main benefit of the final phase of retraction may be to stretch the muscles as the final position is held.",2014,19,4,319-23,10.1016/j.math.2014.03.007,#2731,Hallgren 2014,Biomechanical model

However, the involvement of the PFMs remains misunderstood as the assessment of muscle tone is complex and requires a thorough understanding of muscle physiology in relation to the characteristics and limitations of current PFM assessment tools. The aim of this review was to describe the structures and mechanisms involved in muscle tone in normally innervated muscle, and to discuss and relate these concepts to the PFM findings in women with PVD. METHODS: A narrative overview of the literature retrieved from searches of electronic databases and hand searches. RESULTS: Muscle tone in a normally innervated muscle comprises both active (contractile) and passive (viscoelastic) components. Current methods for evaluating PFM tone such as digital palpation, ultrasound imaging, pressure perineometry, dynamometry, and electromyography may evaluate different components. Research findings suggestive of PFM hypertonicity in women with PVD include elevated general PFM tone, changes in viscoelastic properties, and at least in some women, abnormal increases in electrogenic activity. CONCLUSION: There is a growing body of evidence to support the involvement of PFM hypertonicity in the pathophysiology of PVD. Limitations of the instruments as well as their properties should be considered when evaluating PFM tone in order to obtain better insight into which component of PFM tone is assessed. Future research is required for further investigating the underlying mechanisms of PFM hypertonicity, and studying the specific effects of physiotherapeutic interventions on PFM tone in women with PVD.",2015,12,11,2178-89,10.1111/jsm.13028,#2732,Thibault-Gagnon 2015,Dyspareunia

This model was developed using post-mortem human surrogate (PMHS) osteoligamentous response corridors with effective musculature added (Chancey, 2005). Each ATD was tested using a variety of end-conditions to create the tension-bending loads. The results were compared using absolute difference, RMS difference, and normalized difference metrics. The THOR-NT was tested both with and without muscle cables. The THOR-NT was also tested with and without the central safety cable to test the effect of the cable on the behavior of the ATD. The Hybrid III was stiffer than the model for all tension-bending end conditions. Quantitative measurement of the differences in response showed more close agreement between the THOR-NT and the model than the Hybrid III and the model. By contrast, no systematic differences were observed in the head kinematics. The muscle cables significantly stiffened the THOR-NT by effectively reducing the laxity from the occipital condyle (OC) joint. The cables also shielded the OC upper neck load cell from a significant portion of the applied loads. The center safety significantly stiffened the response and decreased the fidelity, particularly in modes of loading in which tensile forces were large and bending moments small. This study compares ATD responses to computational models in which the models include PMHS response corridors while correcting for problems associated with cadaveric muscle. While controversial and requiring considerable diligence, these kinds of approaches show promise in assessing ATD biofidelity.",2006,50,,567-81,10.4271/2006-22-0021,#2733,Dibb 2006,

Therefore, the aim of this narrative review is to reexamine some of these fundamental aspects of NMES using a tripartite model perspective. First, we contend that NMES does not actually bypass the central nervous system but results in a multitude of neurally mediated responses that contribute substantially to force generation and may engender neural adaptations. Second, we argue that too much emphasis is generally placed on externally controllable stimulation parameters while the major determinant of NMES effectiveness is the intrinsically determined muscle tension generated by the current (ie, evoked force). Third, we believe that a more systematic approach to NMES therapy is required in the clinic and this implies a better identification of the patient-specific impairment and of the potential ""responders"" to NMES therapy. On the basis of these considerations, we suggest that the crucial steps to ensure the clinical effectiveness of NMES treatment should consist of (1) identifying the neuromuscular impairment with clinical assessment and (2) implementing algorithm-based NMES therapy while (3) properly dosing the treatment with tension-controlled NMES and eventually amplifying its neural effects.",2018,99,4,806-812,10.1016/j.apmr.2017.10.028,#2734,Maffiuletti 2018,Electric stimulation
80,11880691.0,The role of O2 supply in muscle fatigue.,Can J Appl Physiol,"It is well established that altering O2 delivery to contracting skeletal muscle affects human performance. In this respect, a reduced O2 supply (e.g., hypoxia) increases the rate of muscle fatigue, whereas increasing O2 supply (e.g., hyperoxia) reduces the rate of fatigue. Interestingly, the faster onset of fatigue in moderate hypoxia does not appear to be a consequence of mitochondrial O2 limitation because these effects occur at submaximal rates of O2 consumption for these conditions and at O2 tensions well above that which impairs mitochondrial O2 uptake in vitro. Alterations in O2 supply modulate the regulation of cellular respiration and may affect the onset of impaired Ca2+ handling with fatigue. Specifically, changes in O2 supply alter the coupling between phosphocreatine hydrolysis and O2 uptake in contracting muscles, which by determining the rate of inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation may affect Ca2+ release. Partial ischemia differs somewhat in that the reduction in force could be due to reduced O2 supply and/or impaired removal of metabolic by-products secondary to insufficient blood flow. Nonetheless, recent evidence shows a parallel decline and restoration of force with alterations in O2 supply but not blood flow alone during submaximal contractions. Furthermore, the causes of fatigue are similar when O2 is plentiful and when it is reduced.",2002,27,1,56-69,10.1139/h02-004,#2735,Hepple 2002,

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective blinded study. METHODS: Forty-seven samples of AdSD-connected speech spectrograms from 27 subjects and 17 samples of MTD-connected speech spectrograms from 15 subjects were selected from clinical charts and de-identified. These spectrograms were reviewed independently and blindly by two speech language pathologists experienced in spectrography. The speech language pathologists designated the spectrogram as consistent with AdSD and MTD, and these designations were compared with actual clinical diagnoses. RESULTS: The ability to differentiate AdSD from MTD with spectral analysis was 94% for rater #1 and 98% for rater #2. No MTD subjects were incorrectly diagnosed as having SD (100% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that experienced speech language pathologists can distinguish AdSD from MTD with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity based on spectral analysis.

82,14639481.0,"Muscle strength, power and adaptations to resistance training in older people.",Eur J Appl Physiol,"Muscle strength and, to a greater extent, power inexorably decline with ageing. Quantitative loss of muscle mass, referred to as ""sarcopenia"", is the most important factor underlying this phenomenon. However, qualitative changes of muscle fibres and tendons, such as selective atrophy of fast-twitch fibres and reduced tendon stiffness, and neural changes, such as lower activation of the agonist muscles and higher coactivation of the antagonist muscles, also account for the age-related decline in muscle function. The selective atrophy of fast-twitch fibres has been ascribed to the progressive loss of motoneurons in the spinal cord with initial denervation of fast-twitch fibres, which is often accompanied by reinnervation of these fibres by axonal sprouting from adjacent slow-twitch motor units (MUs). In addition, single fibres of older muscles containing myosin heavy chains of both type I and II show lower tension and shortening velocity with respect to the fibres of young muscles. Changes in central activation capacity are still controversial. At the peripheral level, the rate of decline in parameters of the surface-electromyogram power spectrum and in the action-potential conduction velocity has been shown to be lower in older muscle. Therefore, the older muscle seems to be more resistant to isometric fatigue (fatigue-paradox), which can be ascribed to the selective atrophy of fast-twitch fibres, slowing in the contractile properties and lower MU firing rates. Finally, specific training programmes can dramatically improve the muscle strength, power and functional abilities of older individuals, which will be examined in the second part of this review.",2004,91,4,450-72,10.1007/s00421-003-0991-3,#2737,Macaluso 2004,

Nonetheless, a complete description of muscular factors influencing ROM among individuals and between men and women is lacking. We examined whether passive muscle stiffness (evaluated by angle-specific muscle shear modulus), tolerance to muscle stretch (evaluated by muscle shear modulus at end-ROM), and muscle slack angle of the triceps surae are associated with the individual variability and sex difference in dorsiflexion ROM, using ultrasound shear wave elastography. For men, ROM was negatively correlated to passive muscle stiffness of the medial and lateral gastrocnemius in a tensioned state and positively to tolerance to muscle stretch in the medial gastrocnemius. For women, ROM was only positively correlated to tolerance to muscle stretch in all muscles but not correlated to passive muscle stiffness. Muscle slack angle was not correlated to ROM in men and women. Significant sex differences were observed only for dorsiflexion ROM and passive muscle stiffness in a tensioned state. These findings suggest that muscular factors associated with ROM are different between men and women. Furthermore, the sex difference in dorsiflexion ROM might be attributed partly to that in passive muscle stiffness of plantar flexors.",2018,8,1,8274,10.1038/s41598-018-26574-3,#2738,Miyamoto 2018,
84,14609030.0,M-band: a safeguard for sarcomere stability?,J Muscle Res Cell Motil,"The sarcomere of striated muscle is a very efficient machine transforming chemical energy into movement. However, a wrong distribution of the generated forces may lead to self-destruction of the engine itself. A well-known example for this is eccentric contraction (elongation of the sarcomere in the activated state), which damages sarcomeric structure and leads to a reduced muscle performance. The goal of this review is to discuss the involvement of different cytoskeletal systems, in particular the M-band filaments, in the mechanisms that provide stability during sarcomeric contraction. The M-band is the transverse structure in the center of the sarcomeric A-band, which is responsible both for the regular packing of thick filaments and for the uniform distribution of the tension over the myosin filament lattice in the activated sarcomere. Although some proteins from the Ig-superfamily, like myomesin and M-protein, are the major candidates for the role of M-band bridges, the exact molecular organisation of the M-band is not clear. However, the protein composition of the M-band seems to modulate the mechanical characteristics of the thick filament lattice, in particular its stiffness, adjusting it to the specific demands in different muscle types. The special M-band design in slow fibers might be part of structural adaptations, favouring sarcomere stability for a continuous contractile activity over a broad working range. In conclusion, we discuss why the interference with M-band structure might have fatal consequences for the integrity of the working sarcomere.",2003,24,3-Feb,191-203,10.1023/a:1026094924677,#2739,Agarkova 2003,

RNA from airway smooth muscle tissue revealed the presence of Kv1.2 (11 kilobases (kb)) and Kv1.5 (3.5 and 4.4 kb) transcripts, as well as Kv1.1 mRNA (9.5 kb), which has not previously been reported in smooth muscle; transcripts from other gene families were not detected. RNA-polymerase chain reaction from cultured human myocytes confirmed that the identified transcripts were expressed by smooth muscle cells. The available voltage-dependent potassium current in human airway myocytes was insensitive to charybdotoxin (200 nM) but blocked by 4-aminopyridine. Dendrotoxin (1-300 nM; inhibits Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channels), charybdotoxin (10 nM to 1 microM; inhibits KCa and Kv1.2 channels), and glybenclamide (0.1-100 microM; inhibits KATP channels) had no effect on resting tone. Conversely, 4-aminopyridine increased resting tension with an EC50 (1.8 mM) equivalent to that observed for current inhibition (1.9 mM). Human airway myocytes express mRNA from several members of the Kv1 gene family; the channel that underlies the predominate voltage-dependent current and the regulation of basal tone appears to be Kv1.5.",1996,271,22,13239-43,10.1074/jbc.271.22.13239,#2740,Adda 1996,

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional and prospective cohort design was used to psychometrically test the VTDp. METHODS: The VTD scale was cross-culturally adapted into Persian language following standard forward-backward translations. The VTDp scale was administrated to 100 patients with MTD (54 men and 46 women; mean age: 38.05 ± 10.02 years) and 50 healthy volunteers (26 men and 24 women; mean age: 36.50 ± 12.27 years). Forty-five patients with MTD completed the VTDp 7 days later for test-retest reliability. Patients also completed the Persian Voice Handicap Index (VHIp) to assess construct validity. RESULTS: The results of discriminative validity demonstrated that the VTDp was able to discriminate between patients with MTD and healthy participants. The internal consistency was confirmed with Cronbach α .77 and 0.73 for VTDp frequency and severity subscales, respectively. The test-retest reliability was excellent with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC(agreement)) of 0.93 for the frequency subscale and 0.91 for the severity subscale. Construct validity of the VTDp was shown with significant correlations between the VTDp frequency and severity subscales and the VHIp total scores (0.36 and 0.37, respectively). The standard error of measurement and smallest detectable change values for VTDp frequency (2.11 and 5.85, respectively) and severity (2.25 and 6.23, respectively) were acceptable. The Bland-Altman analysis for assessing the agreement between test and retest measurements showed no systematic bias.

Use was made of MUs from m.abductor dig.V. The subjects were trained until they achieved more than 50% correct performances. One hundred responses were investigated in each series of experiments. The stimulus to which the subjects should have to respond was a beam presented on the screen of a ""Disa"" 14A30 electromyograph. Simultaneously with the beam the stimulator switched on a digital chronometer which was switched off by the MU impulse. Another two series of experiments were also performed in which the subjects responded with a train of impulses from the MU or with a burst of impulses from the whole muscle. It was been found that the mean reaction time for one impulse from one MU is longer (300 ms), for a train of impulses from one MU it is shorter (260 ms) and for a burst of impulses it is the shortest (200 ms). The histogram of distribution in the first series of experiments deviated from the normal distribution and showed a second maximum at 120 ms after the first maximum. The latter did not differ from the maxima in the distributions of the second and third series of experiments--about 200 ms after the visual stimulus presentation. The difference in the mean reaction time for the three series of experiments is due to the differences in the motor tasks connected with different velocity of increase of the muscle tension, as increasing velocity decreases the MU recruitment thresholds. The separate MUs might be activated in the same short periods as the whole muscle but they showed some specificities in the time distribution of the responses which might be due to some discrete mechanisms of the motor control system.",1979,20,5,279-85,,#2742,Kosarov 1979,

BACKGROUND: No definitive therapeutic intervention is available for TTH. It would be useful for clinicians to have a clinical prediction rule for selecting which TTH patients may experience improved outcomes following a multimodal physical therapy program. METHODS: Women diagnosed with pure TTH by 3 experienced neurologists according to the International Headache Society criteria from different neurology departments were included. They underwent a standardized examination (neck mobility, pressure pain thresholds, total tenderness score, presence of muscle TrPs, Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form, the Neck Disability Index [NDI], the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Headache Disability Inventory) and then a multimodal physical therapy session including joint mobilization and TrP therapies. The treatment session included a 30-second grade III or IV central posterior-anterior nonthrust mobilization applied from T4 to T1 thoracic vertebrae, at C7-T1 cervico-thoracic junction and C1-C2 vertebrae for an overall intervention time of 5 minutes Different TrP techniques, particularly soft tissue stroke, pressure release, or muscle energy were applied to head and neck-shoulder muscles (temporalis, suboccipital, upper trapezius, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, sternocleidomastoid) to inactivate active muscle TrPs. Participants were classified as having achieved a successful outcome 1 week after the session based on their self-perceived recovery. Potential prognostic variables were entered into a stepwise logistic regression model to determine the most accurate set of variables for prediction of success. RESULTS: Data for 76 subjects were included in the analysis, of which 36 experienced a successful outcome (48%). Eight prognostic variables were retained in the regression model: mean age <44.5 years, presence of left sternocleidomastoid TrP, presence of suboccipital TrP, presence of left superior oblique muscle TrP, cervical rotation to the left > 69°, total tenderness score <20.5, NDI <18.5, referred pain area of right upper trapezius muscle TrP >42.23. CONCLUSIONS: The current clinical prediction rule may allow clinicians to make an a priori identification of women with TTH who are likely to experience short-term self-report improvement with a multimodal session including joint mobilizations and TrP therapies. Future studies are necessary to validate these findings.",2011,51,2,246-61,10.1111/j.1526-4610.2010.01789.x,#2743,FernÃ¡ndez-de-las-PeÃ±as 2011,
89,27852738.0,Contributions of rapid neuromuscular transmission to the fine control of acoustic parameters of birdsong.,J Neurophysiol,"Neural control of complex vocal behaviors, such as birdsong and speech, requires integration of biomechanical nonlinearities through muscular output. Although control of airflow and tension of vibrating tissues are known functions of vocal muscles, it remains unclear how specific muscle characteristics contribute to specific acoustic parameters. To address this gap, we removed heparan sulfate chains using heparitinases to perturb neuromuscular transmission subtly in the syrinx of adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Infusion of heparitinases into ventral syringeal muscles altered their excitation threshold and reduced neuromuscular transmission changing their ability to modulate airflow. The changes in muscle activation dynamics caused a reduction in frequency modulation rates and elimination of many high-frequency syllables but did not alter the fundamental frequency of syllables. Sound amplitude was reduced and sound onset pressure was increased, suggesting a role of muscles in the induction of self-sustained oscillations under low-airflow conditions, thus enhancing vocal efficiency. These changes were reversed to preinfusion levels by 7 days after infusion. These results illustrate complex interactions between the control of airflow and tension and further define the importance of syringeal muscle in the control of a variety of acoustic song characteristics. In summary, the findings reported here show that altering neuromuscular transmission can lead to reversible changes to the acoustic structure of song. Understanding the full extent of muscle involvement in song production is critical in decoding the motor program for the production of complex vocal behavior, including our search for parallels between birdsong and human speech motor control. NEW & NOTEWORTHY: It is largely unknown how fine motor control of acoustic parameters is achieved in vocal organs. Subtle manipulation of syringeal muscle function was used to test how active motor control influences acoustic parameters. Slowed activation kinetics of muscles reduced frequency modulation and, unexpectedly, caused a distinct decrease in sound amplitude and increase in phonation onset pressure. These results show that active control enhances the efficiency of energy conversion in the syrinx.",2017,117,2,637-645,10.1152/jn.00843.2015,#2744,Mencio 2017,glycosaminoglycan
90,31629587.0,How Much Will High Tension Adversely Affect Rotator Cuff Repair Integrity?,Arthroscopy,"PURPOSE: To suggest a cutoff value of tension related to retear of a repaired chronically contracted rotator cuff and to analyze the correlation between predictive factors and integrity of repair in large to massive contracted rotator cuff tears (RCTs). METHODS: We analyzed arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs for large to massive (>3 cm) contracted RCTs, not amenable to complete repair by standard means with meticulous release, with a minimum of 1 year follow-up. An intraoperative procedure was designed for the estimation of repair tension using a tensiometer. Clinical and radiological findings were compared between the healed group and the retear group, and magnetic resonance imaging was performed ∼1 year postoperatively for the evaluation of integrity of the repair site. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify the cutoff value of the independent factors. Factors affecting postoperative retear were examined with multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled in this study and divided into the healed group (31 patients) and the retear group (19 patients) according to the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging findings. Significant results showed that tension (5.13 < 95% confidence interval [CI] < 58.15, P < .001) and acromiohumeral interval (AHI) (1.13 < 95% CI < 33.10, P = .013) were important factors for the integrity of rotator cuff repair. The cutoff value of tension was 35 N, and an AHI <6.6 mm may also be considered a predictor of retear. An occupation ratio of the tension >35 N was the strongest predictor of retear, with an area under the curve of 0.799, sensitivity of 84.2%, and specificity of 67.7% (accuracy = 76.0%). CONCLUSIONS: The integrity of a large to massive rotator cuff repair is strongly related to the tension to reach the articular margin of the footprint and AHI. We found that the possibility of retear increases when tension ≥35 N is required. AHI <6.6 mm may also be considered a predictor of retear.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. METHODS: Voice aerodynamic parameters, including subglottal pressure (SGP) level, glottal resistance (GR), mean airflow rate (MFR), and maximum phonation time (MPT), for 26 MTD patients and 27 normal adults were analyzed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: For male samples, MTD patients had higher SGP (P=0.001), higher GR (P=0.012), lower MFR (P=0.042), and shorter MPT (P=0.027), whereas for female samples, the difference between cases and controls was statistically significant only in SGP (P<0.001) and MPT (P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that the threshold of 8.175 cm H(2)O for SGP achieved a good classification for MTD, with an adequate sensitivity (76.9%) and the perfect specificity (100%). Finally, multivariate logistic regression established a credible model (with SGP and MPT as the predictors) for classifying MTD, with a 92.5% percentage correct. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis indicates that aerodynamics evaluation could help the diagnosis of MTD patients, jointly with medical history scrutiny, physical examination, fibrolaryngoscopy, and/or videoendostroboscopy.",2012,26,2,177-81,10.1016/j.jvoice.2010.12.001,#2747,Zheng 2012,
92,3525192.0,Isokinetic dynamometry: implications for muscle testing and rehabilitation.,Exerc Sport Sci Rev,"Isokinetic exercise has become an increasingly popular modality in rehabilitative medicine during the past decade. The facility by which isokinetic dynamometers provide information about dynamic muscle contractions has, no doubt, been a major factor in this popularity. Isokinetic dynamometers are passive devices which resist applied forces and control the speed of exercise at a predetermined rate. Such dynamometers generally provide a record of applied force throughout a joint range of motion. Some of the postulated advantages of isokinetic exercise include safety, accommodating resistance and the facility for muscle force analysis. In spite of the advantages that isokinetic dynamometry provides, there are a number of considerations that are important in the interpretation of force recordings. While the term ""isokinetics"" generally denotes a type of muscular contraction which accompanies a constant rate of limb movement, periods of acceleration and deceleration exist in the context of isokinetic exercise. The acceleration and subsequent oscillatory and deceleration periods of ""isokinetic"" exercise limit the duration of the period of constant velocity in exercises with isokinetic dynamometry. Impact artifacts on torque records result from the compliance of the dynamometer system as it adjusts the accelerating limb to the present speed. The position at which peak torque occurs in a joint range varies with speed of motion. Therefore, analysis of maximal values at specific joint angles across speeds should be made in addition to the peak values generated throughout a joint range. The shape of the isokinetic force-velocity curve differs from the classic curve derived from prepared muscle specimens. As speed approaches zero, the isokinetic muscular force tends to rise much less steeply than that of the in vitro curve. Because measurements of absolute maximal force or velocity are subject to constraints in human studies, the direct comparison of in vivo to in vitro force-velocity curves is not justified. Neural inhibition of the force generated in intact muscle as tension rises has been postulated as a possible mechanism retarding the force curve at slow speeds. The reliability of specific types of isokinetic dynamometers appears to be quite high when test-retest analyses are performed with inert weights. Whether submaximal or maximal warm-ups are essential to ensure stable measures is still questionable at this time. It seems prudent to recommend submaximal warm-ups prior to maximal testing in order to reduce the possibility of muscle strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1986,14,,45-80,,#2748,Osternig 1986,
93,26458020.0,Changes in Passive Tension of the Hamstring Muscles During a Simulated Soccer Match.,Int J Sports Physiol Perform,"PURPOSE: Passive muscle tension is increased after damaging eccentric exercise. Hamstring-strain injury is associated with damaging eccentric muscle actions, but no research has examined changes in hamstring passive muscle tension throughout a simulated sport activity. The authors measured hamstring passive tension throughout a 90-min simulated soccer match (SAFT90), including the warm-up period and every 15 min throughout the 90-min simulation. METHODS: Passive hamstring tension of 15 amateur male soccer players was measured using the instrumented straight-leg-raise test. Absolute torque (Nm) and slope (Nm/°) of the recorded torque-angular position curve were used for data analysis, in addition to total leg range of motion (ROM). Players performed a 15-min prematch warm-up, then performed the SAFT90 including a 15-min halftime rest period. RESULTS: Reductions in passive stiffness of 20-50° of passive hip flexion of 22.1-29.2% (P < .05) were observed after the warm-up period. During the SAFT90, passive tension increased in the latter 20% of the range of motion of 10.1-10.9% (P < .05) concomitant to a 4.5% increase in total hamstring ROM (P = .0009). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study imply that hamstring passive tension is reduced after an active warm-up that includes dynamic stretching but does not increase in a pattern suggestive of eccentric induced muscle damage during soccer-specific intermittent exercise. Hamstring ROM and passive tension increases are best explained by improved stretch tolerance.",2016,11,5,594-601,10.1123/ijspp.2015-0009,#2749,Marshall 2016,
94,29641232.0,Soleus muscle stability in wild hibernating black bears.,Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,"Based on studies of fast skeletal muscles, hibernating black and brown bears resist skeletal muscle atrophy during months of reduced physical activity and not feeding. The present study examined atrophy sparing in the slow soleus muscle, known to be highly prone to disuse atrophy in humans and other mammals. We demonstrated histochemically that the black bear soleus is rich in slow fibers, averaging 84.0 ± 6.6%. The percentages of slow fibers in fall (87.3 ± 4.9%) and during hibernation (87.1 ± 5.6%) did not differ ( P = 0.3152) from summer. The average fiber cross-sectional area to body mass ratio (48.6 ± 11.7 µm(2)/kg) in winter hibernating bears was not significantly different from that of summer (54.1 ± 11.8 µm(2)/kg, P = 0.4186) and fall (47.0 ± 9.7 µm(2)/kg, P = 0.9410) animals. The percentage of single hybrid fibers containing both slow and fast myosin heavy chains, detected biochemically, increased from 2.6 ± 3.8% in summer to 24.4 ± 24.4% ( P = 0.0244) during hibernation. The shortening velocities of individual hybrid fibers remained unchanged from that of pure slow and fast fibers, indicating low content of the minority myosins. Slow and fast fibers in winter bears exhibited elevated specific tension (kN/m(2); 22%, P = 0.0161 and 11%, P = 0.0404, respectively) and maintained normalized power. The relative stability of fiber type percentage and size, fiber size-to-body mass ratio, myosin heavy chain isoform content, shortening velocity, power output, and elevated specific tension during hibernation validates the ability of the black bear to preserve the biochemical and performance characteristics of the soleus muscle during prolonged hibernation.",2018,315,2,R369-R379,10.1152/ajpregu.00060.2018,#2750,Riley 2018,atrophy
95,19196916.0,Phenotypical transitions and Ca2+ activation properties in human muscle fibers: effects of a 60-day bed rest and countermeasures.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Muscle biopsies were taken from soleus and vastus lateralis before and after a 60-day bed rest (BR) to examine expression changes in the regulatory proteins of the thin filament and in contractile function. Twenty-four women separated in three groups were submitted to BR or a combined protocol of resistance and aerobic exercises during BR or received a supplementation of amino acids during BR. Ca(2+)-tension relationships were established in single skinned fibers identified by their myosin heavy chain and troponin C isoform expressions. Expression patterns of regulatory proteins were analyzed on muscle pieces. For both muscles, BR produced similar decreases in slow and fast fiber diameters but larger decreases in P(0) maximal forces in slow than in fast fibers. Specific forces were decreased in slow soleus and vastus fibers, which displayed a reduction in Ca(2+) affinity. These changes were accompanied by slow-to-fast transitions in regulatory proteins, with troponins C and T appearing as sensitive markers of unloading. Exercises prevented the changes in fiber diameters and forces and counteracted most of the slow-to-fast transitions. The nutrition program had a morphological beneficial effect on slow fibers. However, these fibers still presented decreases in specific P(0) after BR. Phenotypical transitions due to BR were not prevented by amino acids. Finally, in vastus lateralis muscle, BR induced a decrease in O-glycosylation level that was prevented by exercise and attenuated by nutrition. In conclusion, this study has addressed for the first time in women the respective efficiencies of two countermeasures associated with BR on muscle properties and regulatory protein expression.",2009,106,4,1086-99,10.1152/japplphysiol.90695.2008,#2751,Mounier 2009,

The V0 values and specific tensions of types I and IIa MHC fibers in the young control group were significantly higher than those in the old control and old physically active groups.

97,11139741.0,[Mechanisms of myofascial pain].,Rev Neurol (Paris),"The aim of this paper is to review available data and current hypotheses concerning myofascial pain syndrome pathophysiology and implications for clinical practice. A muscular hypothesis has been proposed for episodic and chronic tension headache as well as for myofascial syndrome and fibromyalgia. These different syndromes may be compared as, besides their frequent combination, they have common features characterized by spontaneous pain, painful points, and lack of objective findings. They must be distinguished because each has its own diagnostic criteria. Pressure algometry appears to be a reliable method for assessing pressure sensitivity in myofascial pain. Pressure pain is not specific to tension headache and can be observed in other chronic headaches. It has not been demonstrated that the trigger points of fibromyalgia are specific in idiopathic cases. It is difficult to find an electrophysiological investigation which is specific for myofascial pain. For daily practice, the clinical approach with interview and examination remain the advisable attitude. Pathophysiological hypotheses help in better understanding of referred pain by sensitization of nociceptive central pathways according to the Ruch convergence projection theory (1965), modified by Mense in 1994. These theories do not however provide an explanation of the primary muscular mechanisms.

98,2646672.0,Effects of inactivity and exercise on bone.,Sports Med,"Bone mass and muscular mass show a parallel evolution during growth, and parallel involution with age. However, the bone loss related to the withdrawal of oestrogens is independent of muscular waste. The extensive study of disuse osteoporosis shows that exercise without weightbearing cannot counteract the loss of bone mass provoked by bed rest or weightlessness. Physical training, even at low frequency (30 to 60 min/day, 2 or 3 days/week), can increase bone mass or reduce bone loss associated with age. This effect is even present when exercise is practised by very old people at a seemingly low level of muscular tension on bone. It is not known whether muscular exercise could be helpful in pathological osteopenia. Experiments in animals indicate a short-lived benefit of exercise practised during a definite growth period; the long term effect of physical training in humans, after cessation of such activity, has not been studied extensively. Equal distribution of tension on all parts of the skeleton is probably not mandatory to obtain a general effect of exercise on bone mass. It is assumed that muscular exercise acts through tension exerted on bone, but the exact mechanism is unknown, as are the specifications of effective exercise in terms of site of application, intensity, frequency and duration. Moreover, little is known about the expected synergy between exercise and occupational activity.",1989,7,2,71-81,10.2165/00007256-198907020-00001,#2754,Schoutens 1989,
99,7978365.0,Effects of distribution of muscle fiber length on active length-force characteristics of rat gastrocnemius medialis.,Anat Rec,"BACKGROUND: The length-force curve of mammalian skeletal muscle is often wider than expected on basis of the optimum length of the muscle fibers. Two important effects may explain this discrepancy: muscle pennation and distribution of fiber lengths in the muscle. In the present study the effects of a Gaussian distribution of fiber lengths on muscle length-force characteristics were investigated in rat gastrocnemius medialis. METHODS: Fiber length-force characteristics and parameter values of the Gaussian distribution were derived from literature data (Stephenson et al., 1989, J. Physiol., 410:351-366; Heslinga and Huijing, 1990, J. Morph. 206:119-132; Zuurbier and Huijing, 1993, J. Morphol., 218:167-180). Three different constructions of the distribution model were compared with experimental data. Pennation effects were incorporated in the model. RESULTS: Two constructions gave reasonably good results: 1) the model with a fiber optimum distribution, in which fibers acted at the same absolute length at a given muscle length; 2) the model in which fiber optimum length was uniform but absolute length at a given muscle length was distributed. CONCLUSIONS: In rat gastrocnemius medialis, the magnitude of the effects of these distributions is similar to pennation effects.

To elucidate the biochemical events that control erection by promoting or inhibiting contraction of cavernosal smooth muscle, tissue from a potent man was grown in cell culture. The cells grew as noncontractile cultures, but had the following smooth muscle cell properties: These cells expressed desmin, the muscle cell-specific intermediate filament protein. They accumulated 45Ca2+ from the medium, which was released by exposure to the ionophore A23187, to cyclic nucleotides (cyclic guanosine 5'-monophosphate [GMP] much greater than cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate [AMP]), and to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, papaverine; and; they accumulated Ca2+ in an ATP-dependent manner when the cultured cells were permeabilized by digitonin extraction. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake was inhibited approximately 80% by ruthenium red and simulated by cyclic GMP much greater than cyclic AMP. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which is thought to mediate the release of Ca2+ by the smooth muscle cell sarcoplasmic reticulum in vivo, released approximately 0.85 pmol Ca2+/million cells from the digitonin-extracted cells. IP3-dependent release occurred in the presence of ruthenium red and was not affected by cyclic GMP or cyclic AMP. These results indicate that smooth muscle from this human source can be grown successfully in cell culture and that the biochemical pathways that regulate tension in vivo may be perpetuated in vitro. Moreover, some of the clinical responses to drugs administered in situ for erectile dysfunction (e.g. papaverine) may be the result of altered cavernosal smooth muscle cell Ca2+ exchange and may be mediated by cyclic GMP.",1988,39,4,913-22,10.1095/biolreprod39.4.913,#2756,Krall 1988,

A three-dimensional static biomechanical model was used to estimate finger muscle tendon and pulley forces during the ""slope"" and the ""crimp"" grip. In the slope grip the finger joints are flexed, and in the crimp grip the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint is hyperextended while the other joints are flexed. The tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis (FDP and FDS), the extensor digitorum communis (EDC), the ulnar and radial interosseus (UI and RI), the lumbrical muscle (LU) and two annular pulleys (A2 and A4) were considered in the model. For the crimp grip in equilibrium conditions, a passive moment for the DIP joint was taken into account in the biomechanical model. This moment was quantified by relating the FDP intramuscular electromyogram (EMG) to the DIP joint external moment. Its intensity was estimated at a quarter of the external moment. The involvement of this parameter in the moment equilibrium equation for the DIP joint is thus essential. The FDP-to-FDS tendon-force ratio was 1.75:1 in the crimp grip and 0.88:1 in the slope grip. This result showed that the FDP was the prime finger flexor in the crimp grip, whereas the tendon tensions were equally distributed between the FDP and FDS tendons in the slope grip. The forces acting on the pulleys were 36 times lower for A2 in the slope grip than in the crimp grip, while the forces acting on A4 were 4 times lower. This current work provides both an experimental procedure and a biomechanical model that allows estimation of tendon tensions and pulley forces crucial for the knowledge about finger injuries in sport climbing.",2006,39,14,2583-92,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2005.08.027,#2758,Vigouroux 2006,

Wet muscle mass and maximum tetanic tension values for masseter exceed those for digastric and increase more rapidly with body mass (age). At any body mass, masseter exceeds digastric in the ratio of optimum length (that length at which maximum tetanic tension is produced) to in situ muscle length (that length which corresponds to the jaw in a closed position) and the proportion of passive tension comprising total (passive plus active) tension. Passive elastic tension begins to rise in masseter at lengths as short as 87% of optimum (in younger pigs). In digastric, passive tension is absent until the muscle is stretched to a length slightly longer than optimum in younger pigs but occurs at shorter lengths in older pigs. Contractile properties explain functional differences between masseter and digastric more clearly than they explain ontogenetic changes in either muscle. The behavioural transition from infant suckling to adult mastication of solid food is best characterized by a disproportionate increase in mass (and force) of the masseter, relative to digastric, and increased reliance upon active (rather than passive) tension.",1989,143,,16-Jan,10.1242/jeb.143.1.1,#2759,Anapol 1989,

Because skeletal muscle has high energy demands, diversity in fiber types is needed to maximize efficiency; greater diversity in fiber composition then indicates a more diverse functional repertoire. Together, the characteristics of small motor unit size, precise dependence of muscle force upon motor neuron discharge rate, high contractile speed but low tension development, and contractile protein heterogeneity contribute toward the high precision and diversity that is required for eye movements. Finally, the structural and functional characteristics and plasticity of the individual extraocular muscle fiber types play an important role in determining their response to disease or manipulation. The lack of uniform responses across the muscle allotypes in disease, or in response to pharmaceutical or surgical interventions, requires that we obtain a better understanding of the fundamental differences that exist between muscle groups.",1996,46,1,30-7,10.1212/wnl.46.1.30,#2760,Porter 1996,
105,28681979.0,TRPV(1) channels in human skeletal muscle feed arteries: implications for vascular function.,Exp Physiol,"What is the central question of this study? We sought to determine whether human skeletal muscle feed arteries (SFMAs) express TRPV(1) channels and what role they play in modulating vascular function. What is the main finding and its importance? Human SMFAs do express functional TRPV(1) channels that modulate vascular function, specifically opposing α-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasocontraction and potentiating vasorelaxation, in an endothelium-dependent manner, as evidenced by the α(1) -receptor-mediated responses. Thus, the vasodilatory role of TRPV(1) channels, and their ligand capsaicin, could be a potential therapeutic target for improving vascular function. Additionally, given the 'sympatholytic' effect of TRPV(1) activation and known endogenous activators (anandamide, reactive oxygen species, H(+) , etc.), TRPV(1) channels might contribute to functional sympatholysis during exercise. To examine the role of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV(1) ) ion channel in the vascular function of human skeletal muscle feed arteries (SMFAs) and whether activation of this heat-sensitive receptor could be involved in modulating vascular function, SMFAs from 16 humans (63 ± 5 years old, range 41-89 years) were studied using wire myography with capsaicin (TRPV(1) agonist) and without (control). Specifically, phenylephrine (α(1) -adrenergic receptor agonist), dexmedetomidine (α(2) -adrenergic receptor agonist), ACh and sodium nitroprusside concentration-response curves were established to assess the role of TRPV(1) channels in α-receptor-mediated vasocontraction as well as endothelium-dependent and -independent vasorelaxation, respectively. Compared with control conditions, capsaicin significantly attenuated maximal vasocontraction in response to phenylephrine [control, 52 ± 8% length-tension(max) (LT(max) ) and capsaicin, 21 ± 5%LT(max) ] and dexmedetomidine (control, 29 ± 12%LT(max) and capsaicin, 2 ± 3%LT(max) ), while robustly enhancing maximal vasorelaxation with ACh (control, 78 ± 8% vasorelaxation and capsaicin, 108 ± 13% vasorelaxation) and less clearly enhancing the sodium nitroprusside response. Denudation of the endothelium greatly attenuated the maximal ACh-induced vasorelaxation equally in the control and capsaicin conditions (∼17% vasorelaxation) and abolished the attenuating effect of capsaicin on the maximal phenylephrine response (denuded + capsaicin, 61 ± 20%LT(max) ). Immunohistochemistry identified a relatively high density of TRPV(1) channels in the endothelium compared with the smooth muscle of the SMFAs, but because of the far greater volume of smooth muscle, total TRPV(1) protein content was not significantly attenuated by denudation. Thus, SMFAs ubiquitously express functional TRPV(1) channels, which alter vascular function, in terms of α(1) -receptors, in a predominantly endothelium-dependent manner, conceivably contributing to the functional sympatholysis and unveiling a therapeutic target.",2017,102,9,1245-1258,10.1113/EP086223,#2761,Ives 2017,blood flow
106,17468585.0,Effects of eccentric exercise on passive mechanical properties of human gastrocnemius in vivo.,Med Sci Sports Exerc,"INTRODUCTION: In this study, we used a newly developed method for measuring passive length-tension relations of a single human muscle in vivo to quantify changes in the mechanical properties of the human gastrocnemius after eccentric exercise. METHODS: Twelve subjects performed eccentric exercise on the right leg for 1 h by walking backward downhill on a treadmill. Passive ankle torque was measured as the ankle was rotated within its available range, with the knee in eight different angles. Subjects were studied before exercise, 1 h after exercise, and 24 h later, with further measurements at 48 h and at 1 wk in a subset of six subjects. Subjects also rated the level of perceived muscle soreness on a 10-point scale during walking on flat ground. We examined passive tension in the gastrocnemius at a standard length before and at various times after exercise. RESULTS: Muscle tension increased significantly at this length 1 h after exercise (34.7 +/- 7.3%; mean +/-SEM), peaked at 24 h (88.4 +/- 12.6%), declined at 48 h (45.5 +/- 4.4%), and returned to the control level at 1 wk. Stiffness of the gastrocnemius in the sitting and standing postures (i.e., at short and long lengths) was derived from passive length-tension relations. Stiffness increased after exercise, and the relative changes in muscle stiffness were similar in both positions. There was no apparent correlation between stiffness and subjective reports of muscle soreness during walking. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first specific measurements of the increase in stiffness of the human gastrocnemius in vivo after a single bout of eccentric exercise. The increase peaks at 24 h and is nearly fully resolved within 1 wk.",2007,39,5,849-57,10.1249/MSS.0b013e318033499b,#2762,Hoang 2007,
107,1956262.0,Current concepts in lactate exchange.,Med Sci Sports Exerc,"There are several goals to this introductory paper in the symposium proceedings, ""Current Concepts in Lactate Exchange."" First, an attempt is made to set the historical context for the symposium and foreshadow how the paper of each participant contributes to our contemporary understanding of the field. As implied in the symposium title, an emphasis will be placed on the exchange of lactate for other metabolites and ions so that utilization can be temporally and spatially disassociated from formation. Thus, rather than a dead-end metabolite, which only accumulates during exercise, there appears to be great usefulness in the formation, exchange between cells, blood and organs, and utilization of lactic acid (lactate). Specific papers will deal with aspects of lactate release and uptake by skeletal muscle, hepatic lactate balance, the flux of dietary carbohydrate through various lactate pools in the synthesis of liver glycogen, lactate metabolism in the heart, properties of the sarcolemmal lactate transporter, and evolution of a model to predict lactate production from blood measurements. Second, in this review an attempt will be made to present and support a unifying hypothesis (the ""lactate shuttle"") in which the various aspects of lactate exchange may be integrated and understood. Emphasis will be placed on showing several corollaries between muscle and whole-body lactate metabolism. These are: temporal dependence on lactate uptake and release, the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on lactate formation and release, the effect of prior endurance training on lactate metabolism, the effect of lactate on glucose uptake and utilization, and the role of low oxygen tension (hypoxia) in loosening the control of glycolysis. The formation, exchange, and utilization of lactate represents a central means by which the coordination of intermediary metabolism in diverse tissues and different cells within tissues can be accomplished.",1991,23,8,895-906,,#2763,Brooks 1991,
108,12206940.0,Consequences of deltoid muscle elongation on deltoid muscle performance: a computerised study.,"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)","BACKGROUND: The deltoid muscle plays an important role in normal shoulder function. Knowledge of the position of the glenohumeral rotational centre and of the deltoid muscle length is essential to understand optimal placement of a total shoulder prosthesis. OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to analyse the effect of deltoid muscle elongation on shoulder joint function. DESIGN: A three-dimensional model of the glenohumeral joint with deltoid muscle analysis in the scapular plane. METHODS: A geometrical three-dimensional ball-and-socket model of the shoulder joint was developed. From dry bones, the position of the origins and insertions of the three parts of the deltoid muscle relative to the calculated centre of rotation of the humeral head was defined. The position and the direction of the muscle force working lines relative to this humeral centre were calculated using former measurements and CT-data of the deltoid. Muscle length-tension data were applied to obtain angle-force relationships. The model was used to calculate the angle-force relationships, the moment arm and the moment of the deltoid muscle components for successive arm elevation angles in the scapular plane. These data were compared to those of a theoretical situation assuming a 10% elongation of the muscle. RESULTS: Muscle angle-force curves show a more favourable slope after moderate (10%) deltoid muscle elongation. Elongating the muscle by changing the distance between the humeral rotation point and the deltoid insertion along the humeral axis does not affect moment arms. The moments of the deltoid muscle forces themselves, however, seem more adapted to elevation in the scapular plane. The deltoid maximal moment exceeds the arm-weight moment by about 40% instead of being approximately equal, and that the maximum is situated around 100 degrees of elevation. CONCLUSIONS: From a biomechanical point of view, stretching the deltoid muscle by 10% seems to result in a significantly more favourable position in case of shoulder elevation at 90 degrees of abduction in the scapular plane in a centred glenohumeral joint. RELEVANCE: This model suggests that a 10% elongation of the deltoid muscle, the most important shoulder abductor, improves its ability to elevate the arm. If properly implemented, this observation can be very important in the treatment and early rehabilitation of rotator-cuff-insufficient shoulders treated by a specific total shoulder replacement design.",2002,17,7,499-505,10.1016/s0268-0033(02)00065-7,#2764,DeWilde 2002,
109,33891673.0,Mavacamten has a differential impact on force generation in myofibrils from rabbit psoas and human cardiac muscle.,J Gen Physiol,"Mavacamten (MYK-461) is a small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of sarcomeric myosins being used in preclinical/clinical trials for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treatment. A better understanding of its impact on force generation in intact or skinned striated muscle preparations, especially for human cardiac muscle, has been hindered by diffusional barriers. These limitations have been overcome by mechanical experiments using myofibrils subject to perturbations of the contractile environment by sudden solution changes. Here, we characterize the action of mavacamten in human ventricular myofibrils compared with fast skeletal myofibrils from rabbit psoas. Mavacamten had a fast, fully reversible, and dose-dependent negative effect on maximal Ca2+-activated isometric force at 15°C, which can be explained by a sudden decrease in the number of heads functionally available for interaction with actin. It also decreased the kinetics of force development in fast skeletal myofibrils, while it had no effect in human ventricular myofibrils. For both myofibril types, the effects of mavacamten were independent from phosphate in the low-concentration range. Mavacamten did not alter force relaxation of fast skeletal myofibrils, but it significantly accelerated the relaxation of human ventricular myofibrils. Lastly, mavacamten had no effect on resting tension but inhibited the ADP-stimulated force in the absence of Ca2+. Altogether, these effects outline a motor isoform-specific dependence of the inhibitory effect of mavacamten on force generation, which is mediated by a reduction in the availability of strongly actin-binding heads. Mavacamten may thus alter the interplay between thick and thin filament regulation mechanisms of contraction in association with the widely documented drug effect of stabilizing myosin motor heads into autoinhibited states.",2021,153,7,,10.1085/jgp.202012789,#2765,Scellini 2021,
110,14621106.0,Structure and function of the respiratory muscles in patients with COPD: impairment or adaptation?,Eur Respir J Suppl,"Respiratory muscles are essential to alveolar ventilation. These muscles work against increased mechanical loads due to airflow limitation and geometrical changes of the thorax derived from pulmonary hyperinflation. Respiratory muscle fibres show several degrees of impairment in cellular and subcellular structures which, in many cases, are proportional to the severity of the disease and accompanying conditions (ageing, deconditioning, starvation, comorbidity). This structural impairment translates, from the functional point of view, to a loss of strength (capacity to generate tension) and an increased susceptibility to failure in the face of a particular load (early onset of fatigue). On the other hand, there is accumulating evidence that the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles are also able to express adaptive changes in response to the chronic mechanical load imposed by the disease. In most cases, impairment and adaptation of the respiratory muscles reaches a balance that permits enough ventilation for patients' survival. However, this balance can be altered for additional increments of the mechanical or metabolic load on the muscles (e.g. abdominal or thoracic surgeries, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, etc.). Moreover, loss of balance is not always associated with extreme situations. Many patients develop ventilatory failure and require hospital admission even if the cause of the exacerbation is less dramatic (bronchial infections, pain of any nature, electrolyte disturbances, etc.). Although the physiopathology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations is multifactorial, the above-mentioned fragility suggests the existence of a ""fragile balance"" between respiratory muscle overload and respiratory muscle adaptations. Assessment of respiratory muscle function through specific tests evaluating the strength and endurance could offer valuable information about this particular susceptibility to muscle imbalance. Identification of patients possessing a fragile respiratory muscle balance could have important implications for the application of specific strategies such as respiratory muscle training, nutrition, or anabolic treatment.",2003,46,,41s-51s,10.1183/09031936.03.00004607,#2766,Orozco-Levi 2003,
111,25483294.0,Shear wave elastography of passive skeletal muscle stiffness: influences of sex and age throughout adulthood.,"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)","BACKGROUND: Numerous structural and compositional changes - related not only to age, but also activity level and sex - may affect skeletal muscle stiffness across the adult age-span. Measurement techniques available thus far have largely limited passive stiffness evaluations to those of entire joints and muscle-tendon units. Shear wave elastography is an increasingly popular ultrasound technique for evaluating the mechanical properties of skeletal muscle tissue. The purpose of this study was to quantify the passive stiffness, or shear modulus, of the biceps brachii throughout adulthood in flexed and extended elbow positions. We hypothesized that shear modulus would be higher in males relative to females, and with advanced age in both sexes. METHODS: Shear wave elastography quantified biceps brachii stiffness at 90° elbow flexion and full extension in a large sample of adults between 21 and 94 years old (n=133; 47 males). FINDINGS: Regression analysis found sex and age were significant parameters for older adults (>60 years) in full extension. As expected, shear modulus values increased with advancing age; however, shear modulus values for females tended to be higher than those for males. INTERPRETATION: This study begins to establish normative trends for skeletal muscle shear modulus throughout adulthood. Specifically, this work establishes for the first time that the higher passive joint torque often found in males relative to females likely relates to parameters other than muscle shear modulus. Indeed, perhaps increases in skeletal muscle passive stiffness, though potentially altering the length-tension curve, serve a protective role - maintaining the tendon-muscle-tendon length-tension curve within a functional range.",2015,30,1,22-7,10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2014.11.011,#2767,Eby 2015,Age

Human intestinal organoid (HIO)-derived tissue-engineered intestine is a potential cure for IF. Research to date has demonstrated successful HIO transplantation (tHIO) into mice with significant in vivo maturation. An area lacking in the literature is exploration of murine host sex as a biological variable (SABV) in tHIO function. In this study, we investigate murine host SABV in tHIO epithelial barrier function and muscle contractility. HIOs were generated in vitro and transplanted into nonobese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficiency gamma chain deficient male and female mice. tHIOs were harvested after 8-12 weeks in vivo. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were conducted to compare tight junctions and contractility-related markers in tHIOs. An Ussing chamber and contractility apparatus were used to evaluate tHIO epithelial barrier and muscle contractile function, respectively. The expression and morphology of tight junction and contractility-related markers from tHIOs in male and female murine hosts is not significantly different. Epithelial barrier function as measured by transepithelial resistance, short circuit current, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeability is no different in tHIOs from male and female hosts, although these results may be limited by HIO epithelial immaturity and a short flux time. Muscle contractility as measured by total contractile activity, amplitude, frequency, and tension is not significantly different in tHIOs from male and female hosts. The data suggest that murine host sex may not be a significant biological variable influencing tHIO function, specifically epithelial barrier maintenance and muscle contractility, though limitations exist in our model.",2022,36,11,e22613,10.1096/fj.202101740RR,#2768,Beanland 2022,human intestinal organoid

However, its unclear if this change occurs during eccentric exercise. Therefore, 70 eccentric actions of the knee extensors of one leg (with superimposed electrical stimulation) were performed at 100°/s, from full extension to full flexion. Angle-specific eccentric force was recorded throughout. Force decreased at all angles although this was non-uniform. At 70°, force decreased by 25%, whereas at 130°, force decreased by 41%. Initial peak force was recorded at 100° (590 ± 232 N); the exercise bout induced a 21% decrease in peak force and a 10° shift in the position of peak force production to 90°. The rightward shift in the muscle length-tension relation thus occurred during eccentric exercise, where greater force loss at short muscle lengths suggested an eccentric-induced over-stretching of sarcomeres.",2011,61,1,31-6,10.1007/s12576-010-0118-7,#2769,Brown 2011,

STUDY DESIGN: This was an experimental study employing excised human larynges. METHODS: Twenty freshly excised human larynges were evaluated during artificially produced vibration. Each larynx was assessed in three situations: bilateral cricothyroid muscle contraction, unilateral cricothyroid muscle contraction, and no contraction of either cricothyroid muscle. The following parameters were evaluated by high-speed videoendoscopy: fundamental frequency, periodicity, amplitude of vocal fold vibration, and phase symmetry between the vocal folds. RESULTS: Although neither unilateral nor bilateral cricothyroid muscle contraction altered the periodicity of vibration or the occurrence of phase asymmetry, there was a significant decrease in fundamental frequency in parallel with decreasing longitudinal tension. We also found an increase in vibration amplitude of right and left vocal folds, which were similar in terms of their behavior for this parameter in the various situations studied. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that differences in vibration amplitude and phase symmetry between vocal folds are not reliable indicators of unilateral cricothyroid muscle paralysis.",2017,31,3,300-306,10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.08.018,#2770,Ishikawa 2017,Cricothyroid muscle
115,8907127.0,Mechanisms of action of calcium-sensitizing drugs.,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,"This review compares the mechanisms of action of the calcium-sensitizing agents levosimendan, pimobendan, MCI-154, and EMD 53998. By using purified human recombinant troponin-C (cTnC), the role of cTnC as a target protein for these compounds was investigated. Accordingly, the calcium-dependent binding to cTnC in a cTnC-high-performance liquid affinity chromatography (HPLAC) column and the stabilizing effects of the compounds on the calcium-induced conformation of dansylated cTnC were studied. Only levosimendan showed calcium-dependent action on cTnC. Of the studied compounds, levosimendan was the most potent calcium sensitizer in skinned fiber experiments. Furthermore, EMD 53998 and MCI-154, but not levosimendan and pimobendan, increased myosin ATPase activity, indicating that they may enhance the cycling rate of myosin-actin crossbridges. By analyzing the velocity (dT/dt) of isometric tension development in paced papillary muscles, it was shown that levosimendan probably enhances the association rate but decreases the dissociation rate of myosin-actin crossbridges. These effects occurred before the peak twitch tension was achieved. Therefore, levosimendan does not seem to affect the actual relaxation phase. The other calcium sensitizers, however, appear to act mainly by decreasing the dissociation rate of crossbridges. The weak calcium-sensitizing effect of pimobendan may be based on indirectly mediated increase in affinity of cTnC for calcium. MCI-154 might act in a similar way but, like EMD 53998, MCI-154 also acts on myosin-actin crossbridges. We suggest that levosimendan binds in a calcium-dependent manner to the N-terminal domain of cTnC, which magnifies the extent of the contraction produced by cTnC when it is calcium-activated.",1995,26 Suppl 1,,S10-9,,#2771,Haikala 1995,
116,15679811.0,An evaluation of laparoscopic tissue harvesting for human adult urological smooth muscle physiological experimentation.,BJU Int,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the properties of laparoscopically harvested bladder neck and ureteric smooth muscle, compared with tissue obtained at open surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bladder neck was harvested from patients undergoing open (eight) or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (11). Ureter was obtained from patients undergoing nephrectomy (laparoscopic or open) and cystectomy (open only); obtained openly from 16 and laparoscopically from seven. Muscle strips dissected from these samples were perfused in a Brading-Sibley organ bath, and stimulated using standard agonists (100 micromol/L carbachol for bladder neck, 100 mmol/L KCl-enriched Krebs' solution for ureteric muscle). Tensions produced were recorded using strain gauges and analysed using data-acquisition software. Results were compared by a two-tailed Fisher's exact test to determine significance. RESULTS: Openly harvested bladder neck muscle strips from six patients showed a measurable response to the standard agonist. Laparoscopically harvested bladder neck strips from only two patients showed any measurable response. Openly harvested ureteric muscle strips from 12 patients responded to K-enriched solution, while one patient's laparoscopically harvested strips responded to stimulation. This difference was significant in both tissue groups separately (P < 0.025). Histological evaluation identified no specific differences between openly and laparoscopically harvested tissue. CONCLUSION: The yield of smooth muscle available for research is significantly less when the resection is laparoscopic; this might be a result of diathermy damage at a subcellular level. With the increasing use of the laparoscopic approach in urological surgery, the effect on tissue availability for human smooth muscle physiological study is important to researchers in this field.",2005,95,3,442-4,10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05317.x,#2772,Bolton 2005,
117,15736582.0,Biology of the troponin complex in cardiac myocytes.,Prog Cardiovasc Dis,"Troponin is the regulatory complex of the myofibrillar thin filament that plays a critical role in regulating excitation-contraction coupling in the heart. Troponin is composed of three distinct gene products: troponin C (cTnC), the 18-kD Ca(2+)-binding subunit; troponin I (cTnI), the approximately 23-kD inhibitory subunit that prevents contraction in the absence of Ca2+ binding to cTnC; and troponin T (cTnT), the approximately 35-kD subunit that attaches troponin to tropomyosin (Tm) and to the myofibrillar thin filament. Over the past 45 years, extensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies have helped to elucidate the molecular basis of troponin function and thin filament activation in the heart. At the onset of systole, Ca2+ binds to the N-terminal Ca2+ binding site of cTnC initiating a conformational change in cTnC, which catalyzes protein-protein associations activating the myofibrillar thin filament. Thin filament activation in turn facilitates crossbridge cycling, myofibrillar activation, and contraction of the heart. The intrinsic length-tension properties of cardiac myocytes as well as the Frank-Starling properties of the intact heart are mediated primarily through Ca(2+)-responsive thin filament activation. cTnC, cTnI, and cTnT are encoded by distinct single-copy genes in the human genome, each of which is expressed in a unique cardiac-restricted developmentally regulated fashion. Elucidation of the transcriptional programs that regulate troponin transcription and gene expression has provided insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate and coordinate cardiac myocyte differentiation and provided unanticipated insights into the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Autosomal dominant mutations in cTnI and cTnT have been identified and are associated with familial hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies.",2004,47,3,159-76,10.1016/j.pcad.2004.07.003,#2773,Parmacek 2004,

However, even the physical performance of master athletes declines with age, and this decline accelerates from about the age of 70 years onwards. A progressive loss of muscle mass, declines in force- and power-generating capacity, decreased flexibility, and the concomitant decline in specific tension characterize the muscular changes underlying performance declines. In the cardiovascular system, declines in stroke volume and cardiac output, and cardiac and vascular stiffness contribute to decreasing performance. Recent studies have shown that long-term endurance exercise in master athletes does not only have positive effects, but is associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation, atherosclerotic plaques, and aortic dilation, and even more so in men than in women. Recently, larger longitudinal datasets were analysed and showed that the age-related decline in performance was similar in longitudinal and cross-sectional data.

Though a large effort has been devoted to macroscopic failure evaluation, these injuries suffer from a lack of knowledge of the underlying tissue-scale micro-mechanisms triggering such lesions. More specifically, there is a strong need for experimental data to better understand and quantify damage initiation and propagation on MTUs. The present study presents original experimental data on muscle tissue extracted from the hamstring muscle group of rabbits under relevant mechanical solicitations up to rupture, revealing elementary micro-mechanisms and providing quantified values of elastic properties as well as initiation stress and energy release rate. More specifically, tensile, peeling and shear lap tests were performed to explore cohesion of muscle tissue along the fibre direction or across fibres (mode I) and in shear (mode II), as well as at the muscle/tendon interface. We show that muscle tissue is weaker in shear than tension (p-value < 0.01) and that the Biceps Femoris had the lowest energy release rate as calculated from mode I peeling tests (G = 0.23 ± 0.16 N/mm) compared to the Semi-Membranous (G = 0.53 ± 0.08 N/mm) and the Semi-Tendinous (0.45 ± 0.20 N/mm), and that this energy is the lowest at the musculotendinous junction. Our study suggests a preferred damage initiation mechanism based on fibre decohesion in mode I or II and provides quantitative data to model these phenomena. Results also suggest that the Biceps Femoris and more precisely its musculotendinous junction could be the weakest point of the hamstring group. These findings could be used as a basis to develop mechanical models (e.g. finite element) to better understand and predict the onset of hamstring lesions and help in preventing such events.",2021,116,,104324,10.1016/j.jmbbm.2021.104324,#2775,Pillet 2021,Energy release rate

Myofascial disease can present in the form of trigger points, fibromyositis, myositis, muscle spasm, and muscle weakness. The purpose of this study is to research for quantifiable physiological differences between groups of normal subjects and myofascial pain dysfunction (MPD) patients. The first specific aim was to determine the opening of the jaw at which maximal isometric tension can be produced by the jaw closing muscles, with the hypothesis that this opening of maximal tension would be less for a group of MPD patients than for a group of normal subjects being tested. The second aim was to test the hypothesis that the maximal isometric bite forces for the two groups would differ. Patients with mandibular dysfunction are reported to have a lower maximal bite than normal subjects. Bite force was measured with the T-Scan system. An 80 micron horseshoe-shaped sensor connected to a dedicated IBM XT computer recorded the data. A self-contained printer produced the hard copy for later analysis. Vertical dimension or jaw opening was increased in 0.5-mm increments using double flat plane appliances standardized by the Relator. A MANOVA was used for statistical analysis of the data.

121,9421582.0,Differential activation of sympathetic discharge to skin and skeletal muscle in humans.,Acta Physiol Scand Suppl,"The present work provides insight into the relative contribution of different mechanisms in regulating sympathetic discharge to skin and skeletal muscle in humans. Activation of sympathetic nerve activity during common behaviours such as orthostasis and exercise was shown to be highly selective, depending on the specific sympathetic outflow under study. Regarding orthostasis, data from experiments in this thesis revoked the concept that cardiopulmonary afferents only regulate muscle vascular resistance in the forearm, not in the leg. Also the concept that the cutaneous circulation is under baroreceptor control has been challenged. Unloading cardiopulmonary afferents with lower body negative pressure elicited intensity dependent increases in peroneal sympathetic discharge to skeletal muscle, and increases in forearm and calf vascular resistances. Therefore, it was concluded that cardiopulmonary afferents regulate vascular resistance in skeletal muscle of both forearm and calf, suggesting an important role for these afferents in the reflex adjustments to upright posture. In contrast to muscle sympathetic nerve activity, baroreceptor deactivation with lower body negative pressure had no effect on skin sympathetic nerve activity or skin vascular resistance. However, assumption of upright posture increased skin vascular resistance, this increase was abolished when increased vascular transmural pressure was avoided by elevating the arm. Local cutaneous nerve blockade, but not blockade of efferent sympathetic nerve traffic, abolished the vasoconstrictor response to upright posture. Based on these experiments, it was concluded that baroreceptor afferents do not regulate sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow to the cutaneous circulation. During upright posture at normothermia cutaneous vasoconstriction is mainly driven by a local reflex. To explain activation of sympathetic outflow during exercise two theories have been proposed. One is that a ""central motor command"" signal emanates from the rostral brain. The other is that a contraction induced reflex arises in chemically and mechanically sensitive muscle afferents. Although animal studies have provided experimental support for both theories, studies in humans with direct recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity have only provided convincing evidence for the muscle afferent theory. The present experiments are the first in humans to provide direct evidence in support of the ""central motor command"" theory. In addition, these experiments demonstrated a highly dissociated pattern of sympathetic activation to skin and skeletal muscle. Thus, during static handgrip exercise sympathetic outflow to skin of the resting limb showed an initial burst of activity preceding the onset of tension development. This was followed by an increase in sympathetic activity that continued throughout the exercise period. Sympathetic outflow to resting muscle showed a slow pattern of response with a latent period between the onset of exercise and the onset of sympathetic activation. Stimulation of central command during neuromuscular blockade evoked large increases in skin sympathetic discharge with only minor increases in muscle sympathetic discharge. During stimulation of metaboreceptor afferents with post-handgrip muscle ischaemia, muscle sympathetic nerve activity was maintained while skin sympathetic nerve activity showed an immediate return to pre-exercise levels. These data provide evidence that during moderate levels of static exercise sympathetic activation of skin is predominantly influenced by central motor command. In contrast, sympathetic activation of muscle is to a large extent driven by feedback from metaboreceptor afferents in the working muscle.",1997,639,,Jan-32,,#2777,Vissing 1997,
122,21097837.0,Prediction of extubation outcome in infants using the tension time index.,Arch Dis Child Fetal Neonatal Ed,"OBJECTIVE: Approximately one-third of ventilated infants fail extubation. The objective of this study was to determine whether assessment of the load relative to the capacity of respiratory muscles by measurement of the tension time index (TTI) successfully predicted extubation outcome in infants. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Twenty ventilated infants, with a median gestational age of 31 (range 24-39) weeks, were studied at a median postnatal age of 2.5 (range 1-37) days. INTERVENTIONS: The diaphragm tension time index (TTdi) was derived from measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressure using a dual-pressure transducer tipped catheter. The respiratory muscle tension time index (TTmus) was derived from non-invasive airway pressure measurements. Measurements were made within the 6 h prior to extubation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extubation failure was defined as the need for reintubation within 48 h of extubation. RESULTS: Five infants failed extubation; their median TTdi (p=0.001) and TTmus (p=0.001) were significantly higher than those of the successfully extubated infants. A TTdi of >0.15 and a TTmus of >0.18 were 100% sensitive and 100% specific in predicting extubation failure CONCLUSION: In ventilated infants, invasive and non-invasive measurements of the TTI could provide an accurate prediction of extubation outcome.",2011,96,4,F265-9,10.1136/adc.2010.191015,#2778,Currie 2011,
123,31087324.0,Simultaneous assessment of central and peripheral chemoreflex regulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity and ventilation in healthy young men.,J Physiol,"KEY POINTS: Central chemoreceptor stimulation, by hypercapnia (acidosis), and peripheral, by hypoxia plus hypercapnia, evoke reflex increases in ventilation and sympathetic outflow. The assumption that central or peripheral chemoreceptor-mediated sympathetic activation elicited when PCO2 increases parallels concurrent ventilatory responses is unproven. Applying a modified rebreathing protocol that equilibrates central and peripheral chemoreceptor PCO2 whilst clamping O(2) tension at either hypoxic or hyperoxic concentrations, the independent ventilatory and muscle sympathetic stimulus-response properties of the central and peripheral chemoreflexes were quantified and compared in young men. The novel findings were that ventilatory and sympathetic responses to central and peripheral chemoreflex stimulation are initiated at similar PCO2 recruitment thresholds but individual specific sympathetic responsiveness cannot be predicted from the ventilatory sensitivities of either chemoreceptor reflex. Such findings in young men, if replicated in heart failure or hypertension, should temper present enthusiasm for trials targeting the peripheral chemoreflex based solely on ventilatory responsiveness to non-specific chemoreceptor stimulation. ABSTRACT: In humans, stimulation of peripheral or central chemoreceptor reflexes is assumed to evoke equivalent ventilatory and sympathetic responses. We evaluated whether central or peripheral chemoreceptor-mediated sympathetic activation elicited by increases in CO(2) tension ( PCO2 ) parallels concurrent ventilatory responses. Twelve healthy young men performed a modified rebreathing protocol designed to equilibrate central and peripheral chemoreceptor PCO2 tensions with end-tidal PCO2 ( PETCO2 ) at two isoxic end-tidal PO2 ( PETO2 ) such that central responses can be segregated, by hyperoxia, from the net response (hypoxia minus hyperoxia). Ventilation and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were recorded continuously during rebreathing at isoxic PETO2 of 150 and 50 mmHg. During rebreathing, the PETCO2 values at which ventilation (L min(-1) ) and total MSNA (units) began to rise were identified ( PETCO2 recruitment thresholds) and their slopes above the recruitment threshold were determined (sensitivity). The central chemoreflex recruitment threshold for ventilation (46 ± 3 mmHg) and MSNA (45 ± 4 mmHg) did not differ (P = 0.55) and slopes were 2.3 ± 0.9 L min(-1)  mmHg(-1) and 2.1 ± 1.5 units mmHg(-1) , respectively. The peripheral chemoreflex recruitment thresholds, at 41 ± 3 mmHg for both ventilation and MSNA were lower (P < 0.05) compared to the central chemoreflex recruitment thresholds. Peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity was 1.7 ± 0.1 L min(-1)  mmHg(-1) for ventilation and 2.9 ± 2.6 units mmHg(-1) for MSNA. There was no relationship between the ventilatory and MSNA sensitivity for either the central (r(2 ) = 0.01, P = 0.76) or peripheral (r(2 ) = 0.01, P = 0.73) chemoreflex. In healthy young men, ventilatory and sympathetic responses to central and peripheral chemoreceptor reflex stimulation are initiated at similar PETCO2 recruitment thresholds but individual ventilatory responsiveness does not predict sympathetic sensitivities of either chemoreflex.",2019,597,13,3281-3296,10.1113/JP277691,#2779,Keir 2019,Carotid body
124,9779396.0,Frequency response of spine extensors during rapid isometric contractions: effects of muscle length and tension.,J Electromyogr Kinesiol,"During muscle contraction, electrical activity necessarily precedes force output, yet models that utilize processed electromyograms sometimes predict force as preceding EMG under rapid ballistic loading conditions. The purpose of this study was to define the frequency response transfer function of the upper and lower erector spinae musculature, at different lengths and tensions, using rectified, low pass filtered EMG. This would enable accurate estimates of force from the processed electromyogram, specifically during impulsive contractions. Abdominal and erector spinae EMG were measured in synchrony with impulsive low back moments in five men. EMG signals were rectified and low pass filtered repeatedly with cut-off frequencies from 1 to 3 Hz at 0.5 Hz increments in order to quantify the frequency response. It was found that EMG signals processed through a simple, Butterworth low pass filter could not produce the measured force output without an additional time shift. These shifts were quantified by cross-correlating EMG and force with increments of 1 ms. In order to define the transfer function of EMG to force, optimal cut-off frequencies were selected two ways: quantitatively by searching for maximum cross correlations coefficients, and qualitatively. Results indicated that the frequency response of both the upper and lower erector spinae can be modelled with a cut-off frequency between 2 and 2.5 Hz and that these values are not significantly modulated by changes in muscle length or tension.",1998,8,4,227-32,10.1016/s1050-6411(98)00009-1,#2780,Brereton 1998,

126,20889604.0,Effects of submaximal activation on the determinants of power of chemically skinned rat soleus fibres.,Exp Physiol,"Reducing the activating calcium concentration with skinned fibres is known to decrease isometric force and maximal shortening velocity, both of which will reduce the peak power. However, power is also a function of the curvature of the force-velocity relationship, and there is limited information on how changes in activating calcium affect this important property of muscle fibres. Force-velocity relationships of permeabilized single type I fibres from rat soleus muscle were determined using isotonic contractions at 15°C with both maximal (pCa 4.5) and submaximal activation (pCa 5.6). The rate of tension redevelopment (k(tr)), which provides a measure of sum of the apparent rate constants for cross-bridge attachment and detachment (f(app) + g(app)) following a rapid release and restretch, was also measured. Compared with pCa 4.5, specific tension (P(o)) at pCa 5.6 declined by 22 ± 8% (mean ± s.d.) and the maximal velocity of shortening (V(max)) fell by 44 ± 7%, but curvature of the force-velocity relationship (a/P(o)) rose by 47 ± 31%, indicating a less concave relationship. The value of k(tr) declined by 23 ± 7%. The change in a/P(o) reduced the impact of changes in P(o) and V(max) on peak power by approximately 25%. Fitting the data to Huxley's model of cross-bridge action suggests that lower activating calcium decreased both the rate constant for cross-bridge attachment (f) and that for detachment of negatively strained cross-bridges (g(2)). The fact that V(max) (and thus g(2)) changed to a greater extent than k(tr) (f(app) + g(app)) is the reason that reduced activation results in a reduction in curvature of the force-velocity relationship.",2011,96,2,171-8,10.1113/expphysiol.2010.054239,#2782,Gilliver 2011,
127,8950661.0,An evaluation of optimization techniques for the prediction of muscle activation patterns during isometric tasks.,J Biomech Eng,"The purpose of this study was to critically evaluate the modeling potential of proposed optimization cost functions for predicting muscle forces during isometric loading. Models of the muscles about the elbow (eleven muscles) and wrist (five muscles) were constructed. The models accounted for muscle moment arms, physiological cross-sectional area, specific tension, and percent fiber type. Five nonlinear optimization cost functions, a representative sample of those proposed to date, were analyzed: minimizing the sums of muscle force2, stress2, stress3, (normalized force)2, and minimizing fatigue. Several different protocols were implemented, including elbow models which balanced combinations of flexion-extension, supination-pronation, and varus-valgus loads. Theoretical predictions were compared with EMG data of muscle activation changes as a function of load direction and muscle coactivation relationships. Results indicate a strong dependence of muscle coordination predictions on the number of degrees of freedom balanced. The choice of cost function had little influence on the results. The cost functions examined were not able to reliably estimate muscle activation as a function of load direction. Furthermore, specific synergic relationships between muscle pairs could not be accurately represented. An error analysis indicated that the discrepancies between predicted values and actual values could not be explained by errors in physiological measurements, as the differences between these two were relatively insensitive to changes in the anatomical parameters. In short, no particular cost function was found to adequately represent actual muscle activity at the elbow, although predictions at the wrist were more favorable due to differences in the degrees of freedom at the joints.",1996,118,4,565-74,10.1115/1.2796044,#2783,Buchanan 1996,
128,33058713.0,The effect of regional quadriceps anatomical parameters on angle-specific isometric torque expression.,Appl Physiol Nutr Metab,"The length-tension relationship affects knee extension performance; however, whether anatomical variations in different quadriceps regions affect this relationship is unknown. Regional (proximal, middle, distal) quadriceps thickness (MT), pennation angle, and fascicle length of 24 males (48 limbs) were assessed via ultrasonography. Participants also performed maximal voluntary isometric torque (MVIT) assessments at 40°, 70°, and 100° of knee flexion. Measures were recorded on 3 separate occasions. Linear regression models predicting angle-specific torque from regional anatomy provided adjusted simple and multiple correlations (√adjR(2)) with bootstrapped compatibility limits to assess magnitude. Middle vastus lateralis MT and MVIT at 100° (√adjR(2) = 0.64) was the largest single correlation, with distal vastus lateralis MT having the greatest mean correlations regardless of angle (√adjR(2) = 0.61 ± 0.05, mean ± SD). Lateral distal MT and architecture had larger (Δ√adjR(2) = 0.01 to 0.43) single and multiple correlations with MVIT than the lateral proximal (√adjR(2) = 0.15 to 0.69 vs -0.08 to 0.65). Conversely, middle anterior MT had greater (Δ√adjR(2) = 0.08 to 0.38) single and multiple correlations than proximal MT (√adjR(2) = 0.09 to 0.49 vs -0.21 to 0.14). The length-tension relationship was trivially affected by regional quadriceps architecture. The middle and distal quadriceps were the strongest predictors of MVIT at all joint angles. Therefore, researchers may wish to focus on middle and distal lateral quadriceps anatomy when performing ultrasonographic evaluations. Novelty: The length-tension relationship is minimally affected by regional quadriceps anatomical parameters. Middle and distal vastus lateralis and lateral vastus intermedius anatomy were consistently the best predictors of torque. Practitioners may focus their assessments on the middle and distal regions of the lateral quadriceps' musculature.",2021,46,4,368-378,10.1139/apnm-2020-0565,#2784,Oranchuk 2021,angle de pennation
129,16172892.0,"Visual accommodation in vertebrates: mechanisms, physiological response and stimuli.",J Comp Physiol A Neuroethol Sens Neural Behav Physiol,"The mechanism and stimulation of the accommodative reflex in vertebrate eyes are reviewed. Except for lampreys, accommodation is brought about by intraocular muscles that mediate either a displacement or deformation of the lens, a change of the corneal radius of curvature or a combination of these mechanisms. Elasmobranchs have little accommodation and are emmetropic in water rather than hyperopic as commonly stated. Accommodation in teleosts and amphibians is well understood and achieved by lens displacement. The accommodative mechanism of amniotes is of considerable diversity and reflects different lifestyles rather than phylogenetical relationships. In all amniotes, the ciliary muscle never has a direct impact on the lens. It relaxes the tension applied to the lens by zonular fibers and/or ligaments. In birds and reptiles the ciliary muscle is usually split into two parts, of which the anterior portion changes the corneal radius of curvature. The deformation of the lens is generally achieved either by its own elasticity (humans, probably other mammals and sauropsids) or by the force of circular muscle fibers in the iris (reptiles, birds, aquatic mammals). In the second part of the paper, some of the current hypotheses about the accommodative stimulus are reviewed together with physiological response characteristics.",2006,192,2,97-111,10.1007/s00359-005-0049-6,#2785,Ott 2006,
130,2054740.0,Role of exercise-induced potassium fluxes underlying muscle fatigue: a brief review.,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,"The site of exercise-induced muscle fatigue is suggested to be the muscle membrane, which includes the sarcolemma and T-tubule membrane; the excitability of the membrane is dependent on the membrane potential. Significant potassium flux from the intracellular space of contracting muscle may decrease the membrane potential to half its resting value. This is true for isolated muscle preparations as well as for the whole body exercise in humans. Specific K+ channels have been identified, that may account for the intracellular K+ loss. Calcium-sensitive K+ channels open when intracellular Ca2+ concentrations increase, as during excitation. ATP-sensitive K+ channels may be involved but may open only at ATP concentrations well below those attained at exhaustion. However, ATP may be compartmentalized and only the membrane-bound ATP concentration may be of significance. Ca2+ accumulation and ATP depletion cause cell destruction; these changes induce an increased K+ conductance, which may inactivate the membrane and consequently prevent tension development. It is hypothesized that such a safety mechanism is identical to the fatigue mechanism.",1991,69,2,238-45,10.1139/y91-037,#2786,SjÃ¸gaard 1991,

132,30845047.0,Testosterone and Resistance Training Improve Muscle Quality in Spinal Cord Injury.,Med Sci Sports Exerc,"PURPOSE: Spinal cord injury (SCI) negatively impacts muscle quality and testosterone levels. Resistance training (RT) has been shown to increase muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) after SCI, whereas testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has been shown to improve muscle quality in other populations. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine if the combined effects of these interventions, TRT + RT, may maximize the beneficial effects on muscle quality after SCI. METHODS: Twenty-two SCI subjects randomized into either a TRT + RT (n = 11) or TRT (n = 11) intervention for 16 wk. Muscle quality measured by peak torque (PT) at speeds of 0°·s (PT-0°), 60°·s (PT-60°), 90°·s (PT-90°), and 180°·s (PT-180°), knee extensor CSA, specific tension, and contractile speed (rise time [RTi], and half-time to relaxation [½TiR]) was assessed for each limb at baseline and postintervention using 2 × 2 mixed models. RESULTS: After 16 wk, subjects in the TRT + RT group increased PT-0° (48.4%, P = 0.017), knee extensor CSA (30.8%, P < 0.0001), and RTi (17.7%, P = 0.012); with no significant changes observed in the TRT group. Regardless of the intervention, changes to PT-60° (28.4%, P = 0.020), PT-90° (26.1%, P = 0.055), and PT-180° (20.6%, P = 0.09) for each group were similar. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of mechanical stress via RT to TRT maximizes improvements to muscle quality after complete SCI when compared with TRT administered alone.

133,10219378.0,Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in humans: a review.,Acta Otolaryngol,"The human vestibule has preserved an ancestral sound sensitivity and it has been suggested that a reflex could originate from this property, thus inducing cervical muscle microcontractions secondary to strong acoustic stimulations. This reflex is assumed to originate in the saccule, the afferent pathways being either the vestibulocochlear nerve or the inferior vestibular nerve, and the efferent pathways the vestibulospinal tract. Averaging these muscular responses allows vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) to be obtained. The responses consist of two alternatively positive and negative successive waves (p13-n23, p33-n43). The characteristics of this reflex are defined in the literature as follows: it has been established that VEMP amplitude depends on muscular tension. All studies give concording evidence that in healthy subjects the first component of VEMP is more consistent than the second. Binaural stimulation is always responsible for responses of greater amplitude than those obtained from monaural stimulation. Following monaural stimulation, however, VEMPs are either of greater amplitude on the muscle ipsilateral to the stimulation or of the same amplitude on both muscles. There is consensus in the literature demonstrating that VEMP amplitude depends on stimulus intensity: the threshold of VEMP occurrence is clearly above auditory level but varies from one individual to the next. In the 1970s, recordings performed in cases of specific audiovestibular defects suggested that the reflex receptor could be the saccule. More recent studies suggest that the cochlea too could be involved in the response. Likewise, while a number of studies tend to demonstrate that VEMPs depend on vestibular integrity, others suggest that afferent pathways could be of both cohlear and vestibular origin. Finally, while it has been suggested that VEMP efferent pathways travel through the vestibulospinal tract, whether it is the lateral or the medial vestibulospinal tract that is concerned remains to be clarified. A few points regarding VEMP receptors and afferent and efferent pathways call for further investigation. They are inaccurate for use in routine vestibular examination. Once precise receptor localization and pathways are clarified, VEMP recording will provide both a straightforward non-invasive exploration of each vestibule independently and an attractive method by which to explore otolithic receptors and vestibulospinal pathways.",1999,119,1,15-Jun,10.1080/00016489950181864,#2790,Ferber-Viart 1999,

The hand is highly redundant, and shows different functional role of extensors according to its configuration for a same functional task of finger flexion. Through intermuscular coherence analysis combined with hand musculoskeletal modelling during maximal isometric hand contractions, our aim was to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying the control of muscle force coordination and agonist-antagonist co-contraction. METHODS: Thirteen participants performed maximal isometric flexions of the fingers in two configurations: power grip (Power) and finger-pressing on a surface (Press). Hand kinematics and force/moment measurements were used as inputs in a musculoskeletal model of the hand to determine muscular tensions and co-contraction. EMG-EMG coherence analysis was performed between wrist and finger flexors and extensor muscle pairs in alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. RESULTS: Concomitantly with tailored muscle force coordination and increased co-contraction between Press and Power (mean difference: 48.08%; p < 0.05), our results showed muscle-pair-specific modulation of intermuscular coupling, characterized by pair-specific modulation of EMG-EMG coherence between Power and Press (p < 0.05), and a negative linear association between co-contraction and intermuscular coupling for the ECR/FCR agonist-antagonist muscle pair (r = - 0.65; p < 0.05).

In an attempt to develop an animal model which mimics human progressive resistance exercise, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to climb a 1.1-m vertical (80 degree incline) ladder with weights secured to their tail. The rats were trained once every 3 days for 8 weeks. Each training session consisted of 4-9 (6.02 +/- 0.23) climbs requiring 8-12 dynamic movements per climb. Based on performance, the weight carried during each session was progressively increased. Over the course of 8 weeks, the maximal amount of weight the rats could carry increased 287%, p </= 0.001. The improved training performance was associated with a 23% absolute increase in the weight of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), with a concomitant 24% increase in both total and myofibrillar protein, p</= 0.001. Peak tetanic tension (Po) of the FHL increased 20%, p </= 0.001, while specific tetanic tension (SPo) was not altered.

However, previous studies have focused on the biomechanical properties of only the transferred muscle. We developed simulations of the tetraplegic upper limb following transfer of the brachioradialis (BR) to the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) to examine the influence of residual upper limb strength on predictions of post-operative transferred muscle function. Our simulations included the transfer, ECRB, ECRL, the three heads of the triceps, brachialis, and both heads of the biceps. Simulations were integrated with experimental data, including EMG and joint posture data collected from five individuals with tetraplegia and BR-FPL tendon transfers during maximal lateral pinch force exertions. Given a measured co-activation pattern for the non-paralyzed muscles in the tetraplegic upper limb, we computed the highest activation for the transferred BR for which neither the elbow nor the wrist flexor moment was larger than the respective joint extensor moment. In this context, the effects of surgical tensioning were evaluated by comparing the resulting pinch force produced at different muscle strength levels, including patient-specific scaling. Our simulations suggest that extensor muscle weakness in the tetraplegic limb limits the potential to augment total pinch force through surgical tensioning. Incorporating patient-specific muscle volume, EMG activity, joint posture, and strength measurements generated simulation results that were comparable to experimental results. Our study suggests that scaling models to the population of interest facilitates accurate simulation of post-operative outcomes, and carries utility for guiding and developing rehabilitation training protocols.",2011,44,4,669-75,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.11.004,#2794,Mogk 2011,

We were able to find only a few descriptions of this specific fascia in the extant medical literature. To elucidate further the anatomy of this structure, forty adult human cadavers were dissected. Both quantitation and anatomical observations were made of the vertebral aponeurosis. The vertebral aponeurosis was identified in 100% of specimens. This fascia was identified as a thin fibrous layer consisting of longitudinal and transverse connective tissue fibers blended together deep to the latissimus dorsi muscle. It attached medially to the spinous processes of the of the thoracic vertebrae; laterally to the angles of ribs; inferiorly to the fascia covering the serratus posterior inferior muscle (superficial lamina of the posterior layer of thoracolumbar fascia); superiorly it ran deep to the serratus posterior superior and splenius capitis muscles to blend with the deep fascia of the neck. At the level of the serratus posterior inferior muscle, the vertebral aponeurosis fused to form a continuous layer descending toward the sacrotuberous ligament covering the erector spinae muscle. Morphometrically, the mean length of the vertebral aponeurosis was 38 cm and the mean width was 24 cm. The mean thickness was three mm. There was no significant difference between left and right sides, gender or age with regard to vertebral aponeurosis length, width, or thickness (P > 0.05). During manual tension of the vertebral aponeurosis, the tensile force necessary for failure had a mean of 38.7 N. In all specimens, the vertebral aponeurosis was capable of holding sutures placed through its substance. We hope that these data will be of use for descriptive purposes and may potentially add to our understanding of the biomechanics involved in movements of the back. As back pain is perhaps the most common reason patients visit their physicians, additional knowledge of this anatomical region is important.",2008,30,2,125-9,10.1007/s00276-007-0291-4,#2795,Loukas 2008,
139,25808529.0,Muscle force cannot be directly inferred from muscle activation: illustrated by the proposed imbalance of force between the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis in people with patellofemoral pain.,J Orthop Sports Phys Ther,"Muscle force cannot be directly inferred from neural drive assessed using electromyography (EMG). Although the limitations associated with inferring force from EMG are well known, this has received little attention in the clinical literature. This commentary discusses these limitations within the context of the imbalance of force production between the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles, which has been speculated to contribute to the development and/or persistence of patellofemoral pain. The balance of neural drive between vasti muscles is most frequently measured with 2 approaches: (1) the onset of VM EMG relative to that of the VL, and (2) the ratio of the EMG signal amplitude of the VM and VL. Here, we demonstrate that this classical approach cannot determine whether an imbalance of force exists between the VM and VL. Considerations such as altered electromechanical delay (time between the onsets of muscle activation and patellar motion) in people with patellofemoral pain may lead to a reconsideration of the classical interpretation of the onset of VM EMG signal relative to that of the VL. Also, beyond the amplitude of the neural drive, muscle force depends on several biomechanical factors (eg, specific tension and physiological cross-sectional area). Therefore, the VL/VM activation ratio does not provide information about the VL/VM force ratio, which is ultimately the most important information from a clinical perspective. Although the literature includes defenses for both the existence and absence of this force imbalance in people with patellofemoral pain, a reconsideration of the methods used to assess this imbalance is needed.",2015,45,5,360-5,10.2519/jospt.2015.5905,#2796,Hug 2015,anterior knee pain
140,18818044.0,Rupture of the pectoralis major: a case report and review.,J Emerg Med,"BACKGROUND: Rupture of the pectoralis major muscle is a rare clinical entity that is becoming more common due to the increasing popularity of weightlifting and recreational sports. Due to the rarity of this condition, it may be missed at initial presentation and inappropriately treated, potentially leading to increased disability. OBJECTIVES: This case highlights the mechanism of injury, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of rupture of the pectoralis major. CASE REPORT: The patient was a 31-year-old male bodybuilder who presented to the Emergency Department with acute pain and swelling in the left axilla after performing a bench press with a 400-pound barbell. The diagnosis of pectoralis major rupture was suspected and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, and early surgical repair was performed. CONCLUSION: The most common mechanism of injury is excessive tension on a maximally contracted pectoralis major muscle. Weightlifting, specifically bench pressing, is a common cause. The diagnosis can usually be made based on a patient's history and physical examination, but shortly after injury, the diagnosis may be obscured by severe pain and swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice when the diagnosis remains unclear, and can avoid surgical delays. Early diagnosis and treatment within 3 to 8 weeks after the injury has the advantage of avoiding adhesions and muscle atrophy, and can prevent a delayed return to normal activities. Given the trend toward improved results with early surgical repair of complete rupture, it is important to raise awareness about pectoralis major muscle injury among Emergency Physicians to prevent missed or delayed diagnosis and repair.",2010,38,2,196-200,10.1016/j.jemermed.2008.01.025,#2797,Hasegawa 2010,
141,30322821.0,A Novel Laryngeal Palpatory Scale (LPS) in Patients with Muscle Tension Dysphonia.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: Laryngeal palpation is a routine clinical method for evaluation of patients with muscle tension dysphonia (MTD). The aim of this study was to develop a new comprehensive valid and reliable ""laryngeal palpatory scale"" (LPS), based on psychometric criteria. METHODS: The scale items were selected based on an in-depth analysis of the literature and an expert focus group. Scale item generation and item reduction were followed by a psychometric assessment. Qualitative and quantitative content validity (the content validity ratio (CVR), content validity index (CVI)), the qualitative face validity, and the inter-rater reliability were determined. For this purpose, 531 patients were assessed and finally 55 patients with primary MTD (26 women, mean age: 40.8 years, SD: 12.5; 29 male, mean age: 41.6 years, SD: 11.8) participated in the study. A weighted kappa (k*) statistic was used to examine the inter-rater reliability for each single item. RESULTS: Based on the CVR, three items were omitted because they had a score of less than 0.62. The CVI for all remaining items was greater than 0.79 and the scale CVI was equal to 0.96. The final 45 items were a result of the study. The inter-rater reliability for each single item ranged from 0.41 to 1, indicating moderate to almost perfect agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The LPS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing patients with MTD. However, future studies are needed to provide adequate data on sensitivity, specificity, concurrent validity, and cutoff scores.",2020,34,3,488.e9-488.e27,10.1016/j.jvoice.2018.09.003,#2798,Jafari 2020,Assessment
142,36011944.0,Muscle Contraction Adaptations in Top-Level Karate Athletes Assessed by Tensiomyography.,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"BACKGROUND: This paper aimed to compare the involuntary stimulated neuromuscular response of thigh muscles in top-level karate athletes and recreational groups. METHODS: The study included 13 male karate athletes (KAs) and 14 non-athlete male individuals (NAs). Tensiomyographic (TMG) measurements were obtained from the rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (ST). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed between KAs and NAs in knee extensor/flexor delay time (Td), contraction time (Tc), total contraction time (Tct), maximal radial displacement of the muscle belly (Dm) and rate of muscle tension development (RMTD). On a group level, KA dominant-leg extensors and flexors and also non-dominant-leg knee flexors had significant differences when compared to NA. Tct is a TMG parameter in which the KAs and NAs differ the most in the case of the knee extensors, while flexor muscles differ the most in the RMTD parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The lower Tct values indicate an improved ability of top-level karateka to make fast contractions of the agonist muscles. KAs' higher RMTD values suggest on strength characteristics needed in breaking actions of the antagonist muscles. Existence of contraction-relaxation-contraction neuromuscular pattern in the RF muscle suggests on implementation of training strategies that involves both rapid muscle contractions and relaxations.",2022,19,16,,10.3390/ijerph191610309,#2799,JekniÄ 2022,TMG
143,30362889.0,Relationship between pre-exercise muscle stiffness and muscle damage induced by eccentric exercise.,Eur J Sport Sci,"This study aimed to determine whether pre-exercise muscle stiffness is related to the amount of muscle damage induced by an eccentric exercise and to determine whether the post-exercise increase in stiffness is homogenously distributed between the synergist muscles. Fifty healthy participants were randomly assigned to an eccentric exercise group or a control group. The shear modulus (an index of stiffness) of rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis oblique (VMO) was measured before, immediately after and at 48 h after eccentric exercise. The maximal isometric voluntary knee extension (MVC) torque was also measured. Significant reduction in MVC torque was observed in the eccentric group both at post and 48 H when compared with pre-exercise (both p < .001). RF shear modulus increased significantly when assessed at 90° of knee flexion at post and 48 H after the eccentric exercise (p = .004 and .005, respectively). Slight but significant decrease in VL shear modulus was observed at post-exercise for the eccentric group (p = .002). No change was observed in VMO. The decrease in MVC at 48 H was negatively correlated with the RF shear modulus measured at 90° of knee flexion before the exercise. Eccentric exercise induced a wide range of peak torque reduction and muscle-head specific modulation on muscle stiffness. Participants with stiffer RF muscles exhibited greater decrease in force generating capacity at 48 H after eccentric exercise.",2019,19,4,508-516,10.1080/17461391.2018.1535625,#2800,Xu 2019,Elastography
144,26027974.0,Development and Validation of the Total HUman Model for Safety (THUMS) Toward Further Understanding of Occupant Injury Mechanisms in Precrash and During Crash.,Traffic Inj Prev,"OBJECTIVE: Active safety devices such as automatic emergency brake (AEB) and precrash seat belt have the potential to accomplish further reduction in the number of the fatalities due to automotive accidents. However, their effectiveness should be investigated by more accurate estimations of their interaction with human bodies. Computational human body models are suitable for investigation, especially considering muscular tone effects on occupant motions and injury outcomes. However, the conventional modeling approaches such as multibody models and detailed finite element (FE) models have advantages and disadvantages in computational costs and injury predictions considering muscular tone effects. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a human body FE model with whole body muscles, which can be used for the detailed investigation of interaction between human bodies and vehicular structures including some safety devices precrash and during a crash with relatively low computational costs. METHODS: In this study, we developed a human body FE model called THUMS (Total HUman Model for Safety) with a body size of 50th percentile adult male (AM50) and a sitting posture. The model has anatomical structures of bones, ligaments, muscles, brain, and internal organs. The total number of elements is 281,260, which would realize relatively low computational costs. Deformable material models were assigned to all body parts. The muscle-tendon complexes were modeled by truss elements with Hill-type muscle material and seat belt elements with tension-only material. The THUMS was validated against 35 series of cadaver or volunteer test data on frontal, lateral, and rear impacts. Model validations for 15 series of cadaver test data associated with frontal impacts are presented in this article. The THUMS with a vehicle sled model was applied to investigate effects of muscle activations on occupant kinematics and injury outcomes in specific frontal impact situations with AEB. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In the validations using 5 series of cadaver test data, force-time curves predicted by the THUMS were quantitatively evaluated using correlation and analysis (CORA), which showed good or acceptable agreement with cadaver test data in most cases. The investigation of muscular effects showed that muscle activation levels and timing had significant effects on occupant kinematics and injury outcomes. Although further studies on accident injury reconstruction are needed, the THUMS has the potential for predictions of occupant kinematics and injury outcomes considering muscular tone effects with relatively low computational costs.",2015,16 Suppl 1,,S36-48,10.1080/15389588.2015.1015000,#2801,Iwamoto 2015,biofidelity
145,25160741.0,Phosphodiesterase isoenzymes in the human urethra: a molecular biology and functional study.,Eur J Pharmacol,"Experimental and clinical studies have suggested a role for phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes in the control of the human lower urinary tract. This study aimed to investigate the expression of PDE isoenzymes and the effects of PDE inhibitors (PDE-Is) in isolated human urethral smooth muscle (USM). The expression of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) specifically encoding for PDE isoenzymes and isoforms (1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 5A and 11A) was analyzed by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using a tissue bath technique, the effects of vinpocetine (PDE1-I), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride (EHNA-HCl=MEP1) (PDE2-I), rolipram (PDE4-I), sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil (PDE5-Is) (0.01-10µM) on the tension of USM induced by norepinephrine were investigated. The production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) was measured by means of radioimmunoassays. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE4A, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE5A and PDE11A. The tension induced by norepinephrine (NE) was reversed by the PDE inhibitors with the following rank order of efficacy: rolipram (mean: -39%)≥sildenafil (-35%)>vardenafil (-26%)>tadalafil (-20%)>vinpocetine (-16%)>MEP1 (-2%). The relaxing effects of the drugs were paralleled by an elevation in tissue levels of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. Selective inhibitors of PDE4 and PDE5 can antagonize the tension induced by alpha-adrenergic stimulation of USM. PDE inhibition might represent an interesting option to facilitate the relaxation of the human outflow region.",2014,741,,330-5,10.1016/j.ejphar.2014.08.005,#2802,Kedia 2014,Cyclic AMP
146,33242300.0,Human plantar fascial dimensions and shear wave velocity change in vivo as a function of ankle and metatarsophalangeal joint positions.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"The plantar fascia (PF), a primary contributor of the foot arch elasticity, may experience slack, taut, and stretched states depending on the ankle and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint positions. Since PF has proximodistal site difference in its dimensions and stiffness, the response to applied tension can also be site specific. Furthermore, PF can contribute to supporting the foot arch while being stretched beyond the slack length, but it has never been quantitatively evaluated in vivo. This study investigated the effects of the ankle and MTP joint positions on PF length and localized thickness and shear wave velocity (SWV) at three different sites from its proximal to distal end using magnetic resonance and supersonic shear imaging techniques. During passive ankle dorsiflexion, rise of SWV, an indication of slack length, was observed at the proximal site when the ankle was positioned by 10°-0° ankle plantar flexion with up to 3 mm (+1.5%) increase in PF length. On the other hand, SWV increased at the distal site when MTP joint dorsiflexed 40° with the ankle 30°-20° plantar flexion, and in this position, PF was lengthened up to 4 mm (+2.3%). Beyond the slack length, SWV curvilinearly increased at all measurement sites toward the maximal dorsiflexion angle whereas PF lengthened up to 9 mm (+7.6%) without measurable changes in its thickness. This study provides evidence that the dimensions and SWV of PF change in a site-specific manner depending on the ankle and MTP joint positions, which can diversify foot arch elasticity during human locomotion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Joint angle dependence and site specificity of the plantar fascial dimensions and SWV were examined by combining sagittal magnetic resonance and supersonic shear imaging techniques. We revealed that the site-specific changes in PF SWV were related to joint angle positions, i.e., PF slackness and elasticity changed in varying combinations of ankle and MTP angle. Our findings suggest that PF can elastically support the foot arch throughout the stance phase of human bipedal locomotion.",2021,130,2,390-399,10.1152/japplphysiol.00485.2020,#2803,Shiotani 2021,elasticity
147,15301664.0,Excisional biopsy of skin tumors.,J Long Term Eff Med Implants,"The most frequently encountered neoplasm in the US is skin cancer. More than 600,000 new cases of malignant skin tumors are diagnosed in the US each year. One standard method of treatment of skin tumors is excisional biopsy. There are seven technical considerations involved in the excisional biopsy of skin tumors: (1) aseptic technique, (2) examination and demarcation of skin lesion, (3) skin biomechanical properties, (4) anesthesia, (5) excisional biopsy, (6) wound closure, and (7) postoperative care. The physician must use aseptic techniques and wear a cap, mask, and powder-free gloves. Hair is a source of wound contamination, and removal of hair prevents it from becoming entangled in suture and the wound during closure. Because surgical electric clippers cut hair close to the skin surface without nicking the skin, we now use only electric clippers to remove hair. The physician's visualization of the wound can be enhanced by magnification (2.5x) loupes. The physician's plan for excisional biopsy is dictated by the suspected pathology of the skin lesion. The ultimate appearance and function of a scar after closure of excisional biopsy can be predicted by the static and dynamic skin tensions on the surrounding skin. Infiltration anesthesia is preferred over regional nerve block because it does not interfere with the muscle movement that causes dynamic tensions, which elongate the configuration of the defect. Most skin lesions are amenable to a circular excision. In these instances, it is worthwhile to use circular-shaped excisions. The reusable metal trephines have been replaced by disposable trephines that have ribbed plastic handles attached to 316 stainless steel circular cutting blades. Wound closure is accomplished in the same direction as the long axis of the elliptical defect by first approximating the midportion of the defect with a 4-0 synthetic CAPROSYN* monofila-ment absorbable suture attached to the swage of the laser-drilled, compound-curved reverse cutting edge needle. Additional interrupted dermal (subcuticular) sutures are placed in each wound quadrant to approximate further the divided edges of the dermis. Compound-curved reverse cutting edge needles have been specifically designed for dermal closure. Reinforced Steri-Strips are then applied transversly across the incision to facilitate further skin edge approximation. Rigorous follow-up examination is essential for any patient with a history of a skin cancer to detect recurrence and prevent further actinic damage. The use of wide diameter trephine biopsy instruments are still not widely used by physicians because most physicians do not have the technical skills to approximate the defect with dermal sutures. Consequently, this need for a rapid dermal skin closure technique that can be used by a primary care physician must be devised before the trephine excisional biopsy technique is widely used by the primary care physician. This goal can be achieved by developing a disposable stapler for subcuticular closure of the skin.",2004,14,3,201-14,10.1615/jlongtermeffmedimplants.v14.i3.50,#2804,Edlich 2004,
148,17685697.0,Core stability training: applications to sports conditioning programs.,J Strength Cond Res,"In recent years, fitness practitioners have increasingly recommended core stability exercises in sports conditioning programs. Greater core stability may benefit sports performance by providing a foundation for greater force production in the upper and lower extremities. Traditional resistance exercises have been modified to emphasize core stability. Such modifications have included performing exercises on unstable rather than stable surfaces, performing exercises while standing rather than seated, performing exercises with free weights rather than machines, and performing exercises unilaterally rather than bilaterally. Despite the popularity of core stability training, relatively little scientific research has been conducted to demonstrate the benefits for healthy athletes. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to critically examine core stability training and other issues related to this topic to determine useful applications for sports conditioning programs. Based on the current literature, prescription of core stability exercises should vary based on the phase of training and the health status of the athlete. During preseason and in-season mesocycles, free weight exercises performed while standing on a stable surface are recommended for increases in core strength and power. Free weight exercises performed in this manner are specific to the core stability requirements of sports-related skills due to moderate levels of instability and high levels of force production. Conversely, during postseason and off-season mesocycles, Swiss ball exercises involving isometric muscle actions, small loads, and long tension times are recommended for increases in core endurance. Furthermore, balance board and stability disc exercises, performed in conjunction with plyometric exercises, are recommended to improve proprioceptive and reactive capabilities, which may reduce the likelihood of lower extremity injuries.",2007,21,3,979-85,10.1519/R-20255.1,#2805,Willardson 2007,
149,6392811.0,Mechanisms of exercise-induced delayed onset muscular soreness: a brief review.,Med Sci Sports Exerc,"Delayed-onset muscular soreness (DOMS), the sensation of pain and stiffness in the muscles that occurs from 1 to 5 d following unaccustomed exercise, can adversely affect muscular performance, both from voluntary reduction of effort and from inherent loss of capacity of the muscles to produce force. This reduction in performance is temporary; permanent impairment does not occur. A number of clinical correlates are associated with DOMS, including elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure; exertional rhabdomyolysis appears to be the extreme form of DOMS. Presently, the best treatment for DOMS appears to be muscular activity, although the sensation again returns following the exercise. Training for the specific contractile activity that causes DOMS reduces the soreness response. The etiology and cellular mechanisms of DOMS are not known, but a number of hypotheses exist to explain the phenomenon. The following model may be proposed: 1) high tensions (particularly those associated with eccentric exercise) in the contractile/elastic system of the muscle result in structural damage; 2) cell membrane damage leads to disruption of Ca++ homeostasis in the injured fibers, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 2 d post-exercise; and 3) products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents accumulate in the interstitium, which in turn stimulate free nerve endings of group-IV sensory neurons in the muscles leading to the sensation of DOMS.",1984,16,6,529-38,,#2806,Armstrong 1984,
150,25182403.0,Development of low postural tone compensatory patterns in children - theoretical basis.,Dev Period Med,"Neurological literature indicates the existence of children with low postural tone without association with central nervous system damage. This fact induces to think about mechanisms, which allow these children to maintain upright posture. There is a suspicion that compensatory mechanism included in this process, enables to achieve upright posture, but at expense of body posture quality. Observations of children's developmental stages caused determination of some postural tone area, which comprise both children with normotonia and with low postural tone without characteristics of central nervous system (CNS) damage. Set of specific qualities allows determination of two types of low postural tone: spastoidal and atetoidal type. Spastoidal type is characterized by deep trunk muscles (local) low postural tone compensated by excessive tension of superficial muscles (global). Atetoidal type includes children with low postural tone in both deep and superficial muscles. At inefficient active subsystem, verticalization proceeds at excessive use of passive subsystem qualities, that is meniscus, ligament, bone shape, and muscles passive features. From neurodevelopmental point of view compensatory mechanisms can be used in children with low postural tone in order to achieve upright posture, but at expense of body posture quality.",2014,18,3,374-9,,#2807,Gogola 2014,
151,30447672.0,The effect of preload on electromyographic train-of-four ratio at the first dorsal interosseous muscle during spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular blockade.,Anaesth Intensive Care,"Accurate and reliable quantitative neuromuscular function monitoring is desirable for the optimal management of neuromuscular blockade, selection of the most appropriate reversal agent and dosage, and assessing the completeness of reversal to exclude residual neuromuscular blockade. Applying preload to the thumb may affect the precision of electromyography. This study compared the precision and agreement of electromyography with and without preload during recovery from non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade. After induction of anaesthesia and before neuromuscular blockade, the supramaximal current required at the first dorsal interosseous muscle with and without preload was determined. During recovery, train-of-four ratios were recorded using electromyography every 20 seconds. Alternating pairs of measurements (with and without preload) were obtained until spontaneous recovery was achieved. The preload device applied a resting tension of 75-150 g to the thumb. Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements was used to assess precision and agreement of electromyography responses with and without muscle preload. Two hundred and seventy-five sets of repeated measurements were collected from 35 participants. The repeatability coefficient for train-of-four ratios recorded by electromyography with a preload was 0.030 (95% confidence intervals, CI, 0.028 to 0.031) versus 0.068 (95% CI 0.064 to 0.072) without. Train-of-four ratios with preload demonstrated a bias of +0.038 (95% CI 0.037 to 0.042) compared to electromyography without, with 95% limits of agreement of 0.035-0.111. Preload significantly improved the precision of electromyographic train-of-four ratios, with 95% of consecutive measurements differing by less than 3%. Furthermore, electromyography with preload demonstrated a positive bias of 0.04 compared with electromyography alone, the clinical significance of which requires further research.",2018,46,6,614-619,10.1177/0310057X1804600613,#2808,Bansal 2018,electromyography
152,22655489.0,"The effects on cordal and leaflet stiffness of severe apical, posterior, and outward papillary displacement in advanced ventricular mechanism heart failure and mitral insufficiency.",J Heart Valve Dis,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: During the normal opening and closing of the mitral valve there is a finely tuned interaction between the changing ventricular dimensions and fluid pressures, the movement of papillary muscles apically, posteriorly and apart during diastole and in the opposite direction during systole, interactions between leaflets and their controlling cords, and the fluid dynamic forces being exerted on them. The main rough zone cords and the smooth zone of the anterior leaflet are under maximum tension in systole, but retain some tension throughout the cycle. The free edge cords and the rough zone of the leaflets can have no or minimal tension during diastole, and much less tension than the main rough zone cords and the smooth zone in systole. The variability of the form and distribution of rough zone cords influences the flexibility of the rough zone. The net effect of this interaction is a valve that opens rapidly for unobstructed forward flow, and closes at the end of the cycle with minimal leakage. The apical displacement of, usually, the right inferior papillary muscle as a result of ischemic ventricular disease pulls the leaflets into separation because the origins of cords supporting the anterior and posterior leaflets arise specifically from the anterior and posterior sides of each papillary muscle. Myocardial ischemia producing apical papillary displacement can be associated with heart failure and mitral insufficiency. Annuloplasty reducing the annulus to less than the normal systolic dimension can be effective in eliminating both insufficiency and heart failure when the papillary displacement is dominantly apical. In more severe cases of heart failure and mitral insufficiency, the mid-ventricular dimensions increase to a more severe degree, and both papillary muscles are displaced outwards and posteriorly. METHODS AND RESULTS: Static in vitro experiments performed on three human and nine pig hearts showed that the outward papillary displacements increased the tension on first-order cords, rendering the anterior leaflet and the central scallop of the posterior leaflet stiff. The addition of posterior displacement caused the anterior leaflet to become directed at an angle to the displaced papillary muscles, and the scallops of the posterior leaflet to be perpendicularly splayed around the posterior left ventricular wall, such that the valve no longer opened or closed correctly. CONCLUSION: The valve no longer opens or closes properly, and annuloplasty is no longer of use in restoring valve function.",2011,20,6,608-18,,#2809,Frater 2011,

This phenomenon they termed ""symptom specificity."" Patients with cardiovascular symptoms exhibited greater heart rate, heart rate varia bility, and respiratory variability than individuals without such symptoms. In comparison, those with head and neck complaints were characterized by abnormally high muscle action potentials in the corresponding areas. Unanswered by this study was the question whether the heightened reactivity might not be a consequence of the state of abnormality.

154,19448713.0,Tuning of mitochondrial pathways by muscle work: from triggers to sensors and expression signatures.,Appl Physiol Nutr Metab,"Performance of striated muscle relies on the nerve-driven activation of the sarcomeric motor and coupled energy supply lines. This biological engine is unique; its mechanical and metabolic characteristics are not fixed, but are tailored by functional demand with exercise. This remodelling is specific for the imposed muscle stimulus. This is illustrated by the increase in local oxidative capacity with highly repetitive endurance training vs. the preferential initiation of sarcomerogenesis with strength training regimes, where high-loading increments are imposed. The application of molecular biology has provided unprecedented insight into the pathways that govern muscle plasticity. Time-course analysis indicates that the adjustments to muscle work involve a broad regulation of transcript expression during the recovery phase from a single bout of exercise. Highly resolving microarray analysis demonstrates that the specificity of an endurance-exercise stimulus is reflected by the signature of the transcriptome response after muscle work. A quantitative match in mitochondrial transcript adjustments and mitochondrial volume density after endurance training suggests that the gradual accumulation of expressional microadaptations underlies the promotion of fatigue resistance with training. This regulation is distinguished from control of muscle growth via the load-dependent activation of sarcomerogenesis. Discrete biochemical signalling systems have evolved that sense metabolic perturbations during exercise and trigger a specific expression program, which instructs the remodelling of muscle makeup. A drop in muscle oxygen tension and metabolite perturbations with exercise are recognized as important signals in the genome-mediated remodelling of the metabolic muscle phenotype in humans.",2009,34,3,447-53,10.1139/H09-034,#2811,Flueck 2009,
155,14620785.0,"Eccentric muscle contractions: their contribution to injury, prevention, rehabilitation, and sport.",J Orthop Sports Phys Ther,"Muscles operate eccentrically to either dissipate energy for decelerating the body or to store elastic recoil energy in preparation for a shortening (concentric) contraction. The muscle forces produced during this lengthening behavior can be extremely high, despite the requisite low energetic cost. Traditionally, these high-force eccentric contractions have been associated with a muscle damage response. This clinical commentary explores the ability of the muscle-tendon system to adapt to progressively increasing eccentric muscle forces and the resultant structural and functional outcomes. Damage to the muscle-tendon is not an obligatory response. Rather, the muscle can hypertrophy and a change in the spring characteristics of muscle can enhance power; the tendon also adapts so as to tolerate higher tensions.

156,26746381.0,Reliability of Abdominal Muscle Stiffness Measured Using Elastography during Trunk Rehabilitation Exercises.,Ultrasound Med Biol,"The aim of this study was to assess the intra-session and inter-rater reliability of shear modulus measured in abdominal muscles during two commonly used trunk stability exercises. Thirty healthy volunteers performed a series of abdominal hollow and abdominal brace tasks. Supersonic shear imaging was used to measure the shear modulus (considered an index of muscle tension) of the four anterior trunk muscles: obliquus externus abdominis, obliquus internus abdominis, transversus abdominis and rectus abdominis. Because of measurement artifacts, internus abdominis and transversus abdominis data were not analyzed for 36.7% and 26.7% of the participants, respectively. These participants exhibited thicker superficial fat layers than the others. For the remaining participants, fair to excellent intra-session and inter-rater reliability was observed with moderate to high intra-class coefficients (0.45-0.97) and low to moderate standard error of measurement values (0.38-3.53 kPa). Reliability values were consistently greater for superficial than for deeper muscles.",2016,42,4,1018-25,10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2015.12.002,#2813,MacDonald 2016,Electromyography
157,23989009.0,Influence of obestatin on the gastric longitudinal smooth muscle from mice: mechanical and electrophysiological studies.,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,"Obestatin is a hormone released from the stomach deriving from the same peptide precursor as ghrelin. It is known to act as an anorectic hormone decreasing food intake, but contrasting results have been reported about the effects of obestatin on gastrointestinal motility. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this peptide may act on the gastric longitudinal smooth muscle by using a combined mechanical and electrophysiological approach. When fundal strips from mice were mounted in organ baths for isometric recording of the mechanical activity, obestatin caused a tetrodotoxin-insensitive decrease of the basal tension and a reduction in amplitude of the neurally induced cholinergic contractile responses, even in the presence of the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor N(G)-nitro-l-arginine. Obestatin reduced the amplitude of the response to the ganglionic stimulating agent dimethylphenyl piperazinium iodide but did not influence that to methacholine. In nonadrenergic, noncholinergic conditions, obestatin still decreased the basal tension of the preparations without influencing the neurally induced relaxant responses. For comparison, in circular fundal strips, obestatin had no effects. Notably, in the longitudinal antral ones, obestatin only caused a decrease of the basal tension. Electrophysiological experiments, performed by a single microelectrode inserted in a gastric longitudinal smooth muscle cell, showed that obestatin had similar effects in fundal and antral preparations: it decreased the resting specific membrane conductance, inhibited Ca(2+) currents, and positively shifted their voltage threshold of activation. In conclusion, the present results indicate that obestatin influences gastric smooth muscle exerting site-specific effects.",2013,305,9,G628-37,10.1152/ajpgi.00059.2013,#2814,Squecco 2013,calcium ion current
158,7149445.0,The sensation of respiratory muscle force.,Am Rev Respir Dis,"The sensation of respiratory muscle force was examined in 8 normal subjects using the direct scaling method of magnitude production. At the end of a normal expiration, at functional residual capacity (FRC), subjects generated an inspiratory effort against a closed airway to produce a force that correspond to specific numerical values for sensation magnitude. Thereafter, at lung volumes of 2 L above FRC and 1 L below FRC, subjects attempted to reproduce the same force as that previously generated at FRC. Diaphragm electromyographic activity, recorded with an esophageal electrode, was used as a measure of central respiratory motor output. The difference between the mouth pressure during relaxation against a closed shutter and the peak airway pressure during the static inspiratory maneuver (Pmus) was employed as an index of muscle tension. The exponent for the magnitude production of force during maneuvers at FRC, i.e., the slope of the line relating log airway pressure and log sensation magnitude was 1.60 +/- SE 0.15. The exponent for force scaling was 1.47 +/- SE 0.17 after correcting for differences in inspiratory duration during maneuvers of different force. During inspiratory maneuvers at FRC plus 2 L, diaphragm EMG was 441 +/- SE 70%, but Pmus was 111 +/- SE 11% of the respective values during subjectively equal efforts at FRC. During inspiratory maneuvers at FRC minus 1 L, diaphragm EMG was 54 +/- SE 5%, but Pmus was 94 +/- SE 4% of the respective values during efforts at FRC perceived to be of equal force. These results suggest that the sensation of respiratory muscle force depends primarily on signals related to the tension generated by the contracting muscles rather than on the sensation of innervation associated with the central nervous system motor command.",1982,126,5,807-11,10.1164/arrd.1982.126.5.807,#2815,Altose 1982,
159,26486627.0,Intrinsic muscle clock is necessary for musculoskeletal health.,J Physiol,"KEY POINTS: The endogenous molecular clock in skeletal muscle is necessary for maintenance of phenotype and function. Loss of Bmal1 solely from adult skeletal muscle (iMSBmal1(-/-) ) results in reductions in specific tension, increased oxidative fibre type and increased muscle fibrosis with no change in feeding or activity. Disruption of the molecular clock in adult skeletal muscle is sufficient to induce changes in skeletal muscle similar to those seen in the Bmal1 knockout mouse (Bmal1(-/-) ), a model of advanced ageing. iMSBmal1(-/-) mice develop increased bone calcification and decreased joint collagen, which in combination with the functional changes in skeletal muscle results in altered gait. This study uncovers a fundamental role for the skeletal muscle clock in musculoskeletal homeostasis with potential implications for ageing. ABSTRACT: Disruption of circadian rhythms in humans and rodents has implicated a fundamental role for circadian rhythms in ageing and the development of many chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression and cancer. The molecular clock mechanism underlies circadian rhythms and is defined by a transcription-translation feedback loop with Bmal1 encoding a core molecular clock transcription factor. Germline Bmal1 knockout (Bmal1 KO) mice have a shortened lifespan, show features of advanced ageing and exhibit significant weakness with decreased maximum specific tension at the whole muscle and single fibre levels. We tested the role of the molecular clock in adult skeletal muscle by generating mice that allow for the inducible skeletal muscle-specific deletion of Bmal1 (iMSBmal1). Here we show that disruption of the molecular clock, specifically in adult skeletal muscle, is associated with a muscle phenotype including reductions in specific tension, increased oxidative fibre type, and increased muscle fibrosis similar to that seen in the Bmal1 KO mouse. Remarkably, the phenotype observed in the iMSBmal1(-/-) mice was not limited to changes in muscle. Similar to the germline Bmal1 KO mice, we observed significant bone and cartilage changes throughout the body suggesting a role for the skeletal muscle molecular clock in both the skeletal muscle niche and the systemic milieu. This emerging area of circadian rhythms and the molecular clock in skeletal muscle holds the potential to provide significant insight into intrinsic mechanisms of the maintenance of muscle quality and function as well as identifying a novel crosstalk between skeletal muscle, cartilage and bone.",2015,593,24,5387-404,10.1113/JP271436,#2816,Schroder 2015,

Traditionally, osteochondroses have been identified by eponymic proper names. A generic classification is based upon the relationship of excessive or repetitive traction in occasional combination with direct pressure at discrete anatomical sites. The following are models of the several varieties: Osgood-Schlatter syndrome, typifying muscle/tendon stress on the tibial tuberosity; medial epicondylosis (Adams), resulting from forearm and elbow stress generated by muscles and creating traction through the ulnar collateral ligament attachment; and Sever's syndrome (calcaneal apophysis), associated with tension at either end of the calcaneal apophysis in combination with direct impact pressure.

161,10425972.0,Are jaw and facial reflexes modulated during clinical or experimental orofacial pain?,J Orofac Pain,"A variety of jaw and facial reflexes can be evoked by orofacial mechanical or electrical stimuli. Because of its possible diagnostic utility in the management of pain and dysfunction of the masticatory system, the exteroceptive suppression that can be evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles has been particularly investigated. A review of the different studies emphasizes the crucial importance of the area stimulated and the type of stimulation used to evoke the reflex. More recent studies have applied the necessary standardization of stimulus intensity, clenching levels, recording procedures, and unbiased interpretation of the reflex components in muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity. Controversial results have been reported regarding the differences in these inhibitory (and excitatory) reflex responses between temporomandibular disorder or headache patients and controls. Even if the absence of a second inhibitory phase in the masseteric EMG activity of the patients is a frequent finding, its sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic tool for myogenous pain or bruxism remain to be tested. Controlled studies on the duration of the second exteroceptive suppression period in tension-type headache patients could not confirm the initially reported difference between patients and asymptomatic subjects. Studies that involve experimentally induced muscle pain could provide better insight into the characteristics of the afferent fibers and synaptic circuitry that are involved in the jaw and facial reflexes.",1998,12,4,260-71,,#2818,DeLaat 1998,
162,22236523.0,The minimum required muscle force for a sit-to-stand task.,J Biomech,"The purpose of this study was to reveal the minimum required muscle force for a sit-to-stand task. Combining experimental procedures and computational processing, movements of various sit-to-stand patterns were obtained. Muscle forces and activations during a movement were calculated with an inverse dynamics method and a static numerical optimization method. The required muscle force for each movement was calculated with peak muscle activation, muscle physiological cross sectional area and specific tension. The robustness of the results was quantitatively evaluated with sensitivity analyses. From the results, a distinct threshold was found for the total required muscle force of the hip and knee extensors. Specifically, two findings were revealed: (1) the total force of hip and knee extensors is appropriate as the index of minimum required muscle force for a sit-to-stand task and (2) the minimum required total force is within the range of 35.3-49.2 N/kg. A muscle is not mechanically independent from other muscles, since each muscle has some synergetic or antagonistic muscles. This means that the mechanical threshold of one muscle varies with the force exertion abilities of other muscles and cannot be evaluated independently. At the same time, some kinds of mechanical threshold necessarily exist in the sit-to-stand task, since a muscle force is an only force to drive the body and people cannot stand up from a chair without muscles. These indicate that the existence of the distinct threshold in the result of the total required muscle force is reasonable.",2012,45,4,699-705,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2011.11.054,#2819,Yoshioka 2012,
163,18400280.0,Effects of exogenous glutamate and kainate on electric field-stimulated contractions of isolated human ureter.,Urology,"OBJECTIVES: A neurotransmitter role for glutamate in the autonomous nervous system was recently demonstrated in the gastrointestinal tract, and its stimulatory effect on spontaneous motility of human ureter was shown. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of glutamate on the release of neurotransmitters from intramural nerves of the human ureter. METHODS: The effects of exogenous glutamate were tested on electric field-stimulated contractions of isolated human ureter, taken from 16 adult patients after nephrectomy. The longitudinal tension and intraluminal pressure of the isolated ureter were recorded simultaneously. The electric field stimulation was done with square wave pulses (20 V through electrodes, 400 mA, duration 1 ms, frequency 16 Hz). The pulse trains lasted for 30 s, a with 30-s pause. RESULTS: Glutamate (7.9 x 10(-6) M/L to 10.6 x 10(-3) M/L) and kainic acid (6.3 x 10(-8) M/L to 2.2 x 10(-5) M/L) produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the electric field-stimulated activity of the isolated preparations. However, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (9.1 x 10(-8) M/L to 3.1 x 10(-5) M/L), (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (7.2 x 10(-8) M/L to 3.2 x 10(-6) M/L) and (+/-)-1-Aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (7.7 x 10(-8) M/L to 6.5 x 10(-5) M/L) were ineffective. The electric field-stimulated contractions of isolated ureter were also inhibited by lidocaine (3.70 x 10(-4)M/L) and atropine (1.00 x 10(-6)M/L). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that glutamate inhibits electric field-stimulated release of acetylcholine in the human ureter through activation of kainate ionotropic receptors, located on the intramural nerve fibers.",2009,73,5,1136-9,10.1016/j.urology.2008.02.057,#2822,Jankovic 2009,
164,15994135.0,Effects of nicotine on rat sternohyoid muscle contractile properties.,Respir Physiol Neurobiol,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a major clinical disorder characterised by recurring episodes of pharyngeal collapse during sleep. At present, there remains no satisfactory treatment for OSA. Pharmacological therapies as a potential treatment for the disorder are an attractive option and include agents that increase the contractility of the pharyngeal muscles. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of nicotine on upper airway muscle contractile properties. In vitro isometric contractile properties were determined using strips of rat sternohyoid muscle in physiological salt solution containing nicotine (0-100 microg/ml) at 25 degrees C. Isometric twitch and tetanic tension, contraction time, half-relaxation time and tension-frequency relationship were determined by electrical field stimulation with platinum electrodes. Fatigue was induced by stimulation at 40 Hz with 300 ms trains at a frequency of 0.5 Hz for 5 min. Nicotine at a concentration of 1 microg/ml was associated with a significant increase in sternohyoid muscle specific tension compared to control data. Dose-dependent increases in contractile tension were not observed. Nicotine had effects on tension-frequency relationship and endurance properties of the sternohyoid muscle at some but not all doses. A leftward shift in the tension-frequency relationship was observed at low stimulus frequencies (20-30 Hz) for nicotine at a concentration of 1 and 5 microg/ml and a significant increase in fatigue resistance was observed with nicotine at a concentration of 10 microg/ml. As fatigue of the upper airway muscles has been implicated in obstructive airway conditions, a pharmacological agent that improves muscle endurance may prove useful as a potential treatment for such disorders. Therefore, further studies of the effects of nicotinic agonists on upper airway function are warranted.",2006,150,3-Feb,200-10,10.1016/j.resp.2005.05.018,#2823,O'Halloran 2006,
165,32796464.0,Scanning Electron Microscopic Observation of Myodural Bridge in the Human Suboccipital Region.,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),"STUDY DESIGN: A scanning electron microscopic study performed on three cadaveric specimens focused on the human suboccipital region, specifically, myodural bridge (MDB). OBJECTIVE: This study showed the connection form of the MDB among the suboccipital muscles, the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane (PAOM) and the spinal dura mater (SDM), and provided an ultrastructural morphological basis for the functional studies of the MDB. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Since the myodural bridge was first discovered by Hack, researches on its morphology and functions had been progressing continuously. However, at present, research results about MDB were still limited to the gross anatomical and histological level. There was no research report showing the MDB's ultrastructural morphology and its ultrastructural connection forms between PAOM and SDM. METHODS: A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the connection of myodural bridge fibers with PAOM and SDM in atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial interspaces, and the connection forms were analyzed. RESULTS: Under the SEM, it was observed that there were clear direct connections between the suboccipital muscles and the PAOM and SDM in the atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial spaces. These connections were myodural bridge. The fibers of the myodural bridge merged into the spinal dura mater and gradually became a superficial layer of the spinal dura mater. CONCLUSION: MDB fibers merged into the SDM and became part of the SDM in the atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial space. MDB could transfer tension and pulling force to the SDM effectively, during the contraction or relaxation of the suboccipital muscles.

Shear wave elastography can be used to quantify the shear modulus (i.e. an index of stiffness) of a specific muscle. This study assessed the passive behavior of lower leg muscles during passive dorsiflexion performed with the knee fully extended (experiment 1, n = 22) or with the knee flexed at 90° (experiment 2, n = 20). The shear modulus measurements were repeated twice during experiment 1 to assess the inter-day reliability. During both experiments, the shear modulus of the following plantar flexors was randomly measured: gastrocnemii medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL), soleus (SOL), peroneus longus (PL), and the deep muscles flexor digitorum longus (FDL), flexor hallucis longus (FHL), tibialis posterior (TP). Two antagonist muscles tibialis anterior (TA), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were also recorded. Measurements were performed in different proximo-distal regions for GM, GL and SOL. Inter-day reliability was adequate for all muscles (coefficient of variation < 15%), except for TP. In experiment 1, GM exhibited the highest shear modulus at 80% of the maximal range of motion (128.5 ± 27.3 kPa) and was followed by GL (67.1 ± 24.1 kPa). In experiment 2, SOL exhibited the highest shear modulus (55.1 ± 18.0 kPa). The highest values of shear modulus were found for the distal locations of both the GM (80% of participants in experiment 1) and the SOL (100% of participants in experiment 2). For both experiments, deep muscles and PL exhibited low levels of stiffness during the stretch in young asymptomatic adults, which was unknown until now. These results provide a deeper understanding of passive mechanical properties and the distribution of stiffness between and within the plantar flexor muscles during stretching between them and thus could be relevant to study the effects of aging, disease progression, and rehabilitation on stiffness.",2017,230,5,639-650,10.1111/joa.12589,#2826,LeSant 2017,ankle joint
167,2674708.0,Altered mechanisms of muscular force generation in lower motor neuron disease.,Muscle Nerve,"Recruitment and firing rate modulation (FRM) of single motor units (MUs) were evaluated in the first dorsal interosseus muscle in patients with chronic lower motor neuron disorders of primarily neuroaxonal or demyelinating pathology. Residual muscle function was estimated by maximal voluntary force, twitch tension, and compound muscle action potential. The recruitment range of MUs was expanded toward higher relative force levels in all patients. Changes in firing rates per unit force increment were larger in patients with more pronounced muscle atrophy. When this effect was accounted for by calculating FRM for increments of 10% of residual maximal force, patients with subnormal motor nerve conduction velocities showed selective impairment of rate modulation. This was not due to intermittent conduction failure. We conclude that the two force-generating mechanisms, recruitment and FRM, show unspecific compensatory changes related to the loss of MUs and also alterations that are specifically related to the neuroaxonal or demyelinating nature of the neuropathy.",1989,12,8,647-59,10.1002/mus.880120806,#2827,Reiners 1989,
168,16870841.0,High stiffness of human digital flexor tendons is suited for precise finger positional control.,J Neurophysiol,"The objective of this study was to define the biomechanical properties of the human digital flexor tendons and to compare these biomechanical properties to other muscle-tendon units in the forearm. Mechanical measurements were performed on fresh-frozen tendons under physiological load and temperature conditions. Loads were determined by first measuring the physiological cross-sectional area of each digital belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and estimating maximum tension (P(o)) of that specific muscle head. Loading each tendon to the appropriate P(o) resulted in no significant difference in tendon strain among any of the tendons within each muscle (P > 0.05; digits 2-5) or between muscle types (FDP vs. FDS). The one exception to this finding was that a significantly higher strain at Po was observed in the FDP tendon to the small finger (P < 0.05). Average absolute strains observed for the FDP and FDS tendons (1.20 +/- 0.38%, mean +/- SD; n = 39) were significantly lower than those observed previously in a study of the prime movers of the wrist. The measured strain of approximately 1.5% was less than half of that predicted to occur in muscles of this architectural design. Modeling sarcomere shortening magnitudes during FDP or FDS contraction yielded a value of only 0.10 microm, which would have a negligible effect on the force generating capacity of these muscles. Thus the high stiffness of the digital flexor tendons suits them well for fine positional control and would render their muscle spindles quite sensitive to length perturbations at the fingertips.",2006,96,5,2815-8,10.1152/jn.00284.2006,#2828,Ward 2006,
169,25503460.0,Independent active contraction of extraocular muscle compartments.,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,"PURPOSE: Intramuscular innervation of horizontal rectus extraocular muscle (EOMs) is segregated into superior and inferior (transverse) compartments, whereas all EOMs are also divided into global (GL) and orbital (OL) layers with scleral and pulley insertions, respectively. Mechanical independence between both types of compartments has been demonstrated during passive tensile loading. We examined coupling between EOM compartments during active, ex vivo contraction. METHODS: Fresh bovine EOMs were removed, and one compartment of each was coated with hydrophobic petrolatum. Contraction of the uncoated compartment was induced by immersion in a solution of 50 mM CaCl2 at 38°C labeled with sodium fluorescein dye, whereas tensions in both compartments were monitored by strain gauges. Control experiments omitted petrolatum so that the entire EOM contracted. After physiological experiments, EOMs were sectioned transversely to demonstrate specificity of CaCl2 permeation by yellow fluorescence dye excited by blue light. RESULTS: In control experiments without petrolatum, both transverse and GL and OL compartments contracted similarly. Selective compartmental omission of petrolatum caused markedly independent compartmental contraction whether measured at the GL or the OL insertions or for transverse compartments at the scleral insertion. Although some CaCl2 spread occurred, mean (±SD) tension in the coated compartments averaged only 10.5 ± 3.3% and 6.0 ± 1.5% in GL/OL and transverse compartments, respectively relative to uncoated compartments. Fluorescein penetration confirmed selective CaCl2 permeation. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm passive tensile findings of mechanical independence of EOM compartments and extend results to active contraction. EOMs behave actively as if composed of mechanically independent parallel fiber bundles having different insertional targets, consistent with the active pulley and transverse compartmental hypotheses.",2014,56,1,199-206,10.1167/iovs.14-15968,#2829,Shin 2014,active pulley hypothesis
170,35585106.0,Preliminary study of reliability of transcutaneous sensors in measuring intraabdominal pressure.,Sci Rep,"Early recognition of elevated intraabdominal pressure (IAP) in critically ill patients is essential, since it can result in abdominal compartment syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition. The measurement of intravesical pressure is currently considered the gold standard for IAP assessment. Alternative methods have been proposed, where IAP assessment is based on measuring abdominal wall tension, which reflects the pressure in the abdominal cavity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using patch-like transcutaneous sensors to estimate changes in IAP, which could facilitate the monitoring of IAP in clinical practice. This study was performed with 30 patients during early postoperative care. All patients still had an indwelling urinary catheter postoperatively. Four wearable sensors were attached to the outer surface of the abdominal region to detect the changes in abdominal wall tension. Additionally, surface EMG was used to monitor the activity of the abdominal muscles. The thickness of the subcutaneous tissue was measured with ultrasound. Patients performed 4 cycles of the Valsalva manoeuvre, with a resting period in between (the minimal resting period was 30 s, with a prolongation as necessary to ensure that the fluid level in the measuring system had equilibrated). The IAP was estimated with intravesical pressure measurements during all resting periods and all Valsalva manoeuvres, while the sensors continuously measured changes in abdominal wall tension. The association between the subcutaneous thickness and tension changes on the surface and the intraabdominal pressure was statistically significant, but a large part of the variability was explained by individual patient factors. As a consequence, the predictions of IAP using transcutaneous sensors were not biased, but they were quite variable. The specificity of detecting intraabdominal pressure of 20 mmHg and above is 88%, with an NPV of 96%, while its sensitivity and PPV are currently far lower. There are inherent limitations of the chosen preliminary study design that directly caused the low sensitivity of our method as well as the poor agreement with the gold standard method; in spite of that, we have shown that these sensors have the potential to be used to monitor intraabdominal pressure. We are planning a study that would more closely resemble the intended clinical use and expect it to show more consistent results with a far smaller error.",2022,12,1,8268,10.1038/s41598-022-12388-x,#2830,KuÅ¡ar 2022,

The influence of movement tempo on acute neuromuscular, hormonal, and mechanical responses to resistance exercise-a mini review. J Strength Cond Res 34(8): 2369-2383, 2020-Resistance training studies mainly analyze variables such as the type and order of exercise, intensity, number of sets, number of repetitions, and duration and frequency of rest periods. However, one variable that is often overlooked in resistance training research, as well as in practice, is premeditated movement tempo, which can influence a myriad of mechanical and physiological factors associated with training and adaptation. Specifically, this article provides an overview of the available scientific literature and describes how slower tempos negatively affect the 1-repetition maximum, the possible load to be used, and the number of repetitions performed with a given load, while also increasing the total time under tension, which can mediate acute cardiovascular and hormonal responses. As a result, coaches should consider testing maximal strength and the maximal number of repetitions that can be performed with each movement tempo that is to be used during training. Otherwise, programming resistance training using various movement tempos is more of a trial-and-error approach, rather than being evidence or practice based. Furthermore, practical applications are provided to show how movement tempo can be adjusted for a variety of case study-type scenarios.",2020,34,8,2369-2383,10.1519/JSC.0000000000003636,#2831,Wilk 2020,

A systematic critical literature review.,J Manipulative Physiol Ther,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the peer-reviewed literature about the reliability and validity of chiropractic tests used to determine the need for spinal manipulative therapy of the lumbo-pelvic spine, taking into account the quality of the studies. DATA SOURCES: The CHIROLARS database was searched for the years 1976 to 1995 with the following index terms: ""chiropractic tests,"" ""chiropractic adjusting technique,"" ""motion palpation,"" ""movement palpation,"" ""leg length,"" ""applied kinesiology,"" and ""sacrooccipital technique."" In addition, a manual search was performed at the libraries of the Nordic Institute of Chiropractic and Clinical Biomechanics, Odense, Denmark, and the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic, Bournemouth, United Kingdom. STUDY SELECTION: Studies pertaining to intraexaminer reliability, interexaminer reliability, and/or validity of chiropractic evaluation of the lumbo-pelvic spine were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data quality were assessed independently by the two reviewers, with a quality score based on predefined methodologic criteria. Results of the studies were then evaluated in relation to quality. DATA SYNTHESIS: None of the tests studied had been sufficiently evaluated in relation to reliability and validity. Only tests for palpation for pain had consistently acceptable results. Motion palpation of the lumbar spine might be valid but showed poor reliability, whereas motion palpation of the sacroiliac joints seemed to be slightly reliable but was not shown to be valid. Measures of leg-length inequality seemed to correlate with radiographic measurements but consensus on method and interpretation is lacking. For the sacrooccipital technique, some evidence favors the validity of the arm-fossa test but the rest of the test regimen remains poorly documented. Documentation of applied kinesiology was not available. Palpation for muscle tension, palpation for misalignment, and visual inspection were either undocumented, unreliable, or not valid. CONCLUSION: The detection of the manipulative lesion in the lumbo-pelvic spine depends on valid and reliable tests.

Nineteen subjects were randomly divided into a trained group and a control group. Active and passive components of the SEC stiffness were determined using a fast stretch during submaximal voluntary isometric plantarflexor activity. Geometrical parameters of the triceps surae muscles and the Achilles tendon were determined using ultrasonography. A significant increase in the passive component of the SEC stiffness was found (p < 0.05). In contrast, a significant decrease in the active part of the SEC stiffness was observed (p < 0.05). No significant changes in plantarflexor muscles CSA, architecture and Achilles tendon CSA were seen (p > 0.05). Thus, plyometric training led to specific adaptations within each part of the SEC. Theses adaptations could increase both the efficiency of the energy storage-recoil process and muscular tension transmission leading to an increase in jump performances.",2011,111,3,539-48,10.1007/s00421-010-1667-4,#2835,FourÃ© 2011,
175,32032054.0,"New Paradigms in the Throwing Shoulder: Labral Injury, Surgery, and Rehabilitation.",Instr Course Lect,"Knowledge regarding the importance of the superior labrum in shoulder function is evolving as biomechanical and clinical studies define the roles of the labrum in shoulder function and dysfunction. The diagnosis of the clinically significant labral injury, the alteration in labral anatomy that is associated with the production of clinical symptoms and dysfunction and requires management, is based on specific history and clinical examination findings that point to the loss of labral roles. Surgical management should address all aspects of the altered labral anatomy and repair the labral structure to allow normal labral roles without excessive biceps tension. It may be that the superior labral injury may be a normal variant in throwers, allowing the thrower to achieve optimum cocking in external rotation. Specific guidelines for intraoperative assessment of the labral injury and criteria for determining the adequacy of the repair may be followed. Emerging data suggest that approximately 50% of patients with a clinically significant labral injury can become asymptomatic with guided rehabilitation. Rehabilitation has specific goals to restore the demonstrated deficits, should be organized into specific phases based on the patient's injury and functional capability, and should have specific criteria to allow return to play.",2019,68,,499-512,,#2836,Kibler 2019,
176,28211795.0,A murine model of a novel surgical architecture for proprioceptive muscle feedback and its potential application to control of advanced limb prostheses.,J Neural Eng,"OBJECTIVE: Proprioceptive mechanisms play a critical role in both reflexive and volitional lower extremity control. Significant strides have been made in the development of bionic limbs that are capable of bi-directional communication with the peripheral nervous system, but none of these systems have been capable of providing physiologically-relevant muscle-based proprioceptive feedback through natural neural pathways. In this study, we present the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI), a surgical approach with the capacity to provide graded kinesthetic feedback from a prosthesis through mechanical activation of native mechanoreceptors within residual agonist-antagonist muscle pairs. APPROACH: (1) Sonomicrometery and electroneurography measurement systems were validated using a servo-based muscle tensioning system. (2) A heuristic controller was implemented to modulate functional electrical stimulation of an agonist muscle, using sonomicrometric measurements of stretch from a mechanically-coupled antagonist muscle as feedback. (3) One AMI was surgically constructed in the hindlimb of each rat. (4) The gastrocnemius-soleus complex of the rat was cycled through a series of ramp-and-hold stretches in two different muscle architectures: native (physiologically-intact) and AMI (modified). Integrated electroneurography from the tibial nerve was compared across the two architectures. MAIN RESULTS: Correlation between stretch and afferent signal demonstrated that the AMI is capable of provoking graded afferent signals in response to ramp-and-hold stretches, in a manner similar to the native muscle architecture. The response magnitude in the AMI was reduced when compared to the native architecture, likely due to lower stretch amplitudes. The closed-loop control system showed robustness at high stretch magnitudes, with some oscillation at low stretch magnitudes. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that the AMI has the potential to communicate meaningful kinesthetic feedback from a prosthetic limb by replicating the agonist-antagonist relationships that are fundamental to physiological proprioception.",2017,14,3,36002,10.1088/1741-2552/aa614b,#2838,Clites 2017,

Moreover, we tested if changes in muscle quality were associated with functional capacity. Twenty-four older women (66.3 ± 5.8 years; 69.0 ± 3.0 kg; 25.3 ± 1.4 kg·m(-2)) were recruited to the study. After completion of the baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to either the resistance training (RET, n = 12) or an active control group (CTR, n = 12). Muscle quality was evaluated through muscle echo intensity (MQ(EI)) and specific tension (MQ(ST)). Muscle thickness, unilateral plantar flexor muscle strength and functional tests were evaluated at baseline and after the training period. After 8 weeks, both MQ(EI) and MQ(ST) did not respond to the intervention. Furthermore, significant changes in stair climb performance (P < 0.05) were not associated with plantar flexor-derived muscle quality (P > 0.05). Finally, significant gains in muscle hypertrophy were observed in the RET group (P < 0.01), while muscle strength failed to change significantly (P > 0.05). In conclusion, a resistance training program provided significant benefits in the stair climb test, unrelated to plantar flexor-derived muscle quality measures as previously demonstrated in quadriceps femoris.",2020,138,,111003,10.1016/j.exger.2020.111003,#2839,Lopez 2020,Aging

Muscle biopsies were obtained from the gastrocnemius of eight competitive runners (Run) and eight recreationally active individuals (Rec). Slow-twitch [myosin heavy chain (MHC) I] and fast-twitch (MHC IIa) myofibers were isolated and analyzed for diameter (microm), peak force (Po; mN), unloaded contraction velocity (Vo; fiber lengths/s), and power. Maximum oxygen uptake was higher (P<0.05) in Run (71+/-1 vs. 47+/-2 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)). Diameter of MHC I and MHC IIa fibers from Run subjects was approximately 20% greater (P<0.05) than Rec. Peak force of the MHC IIa fibers was 31% higher (P<0.05) in Run, whereas Po of MHC I fibers was not different between groups. No differences for specific tension (Po/cross-sectional area) were present between groups for either fiber type. Vo was higher (P<0.05) in MHC I (+70%) and MHC IIa (+18%) fibers from Run subjects. In vitro peak absolute power (microN.s(-1)) of both fiber types was greater (P<0.05) in Run (131 and 85% for MHC I and MHC IIa, respectively). Additionally, normalized power (W/l) of the MHC I fibers was 64% higher in Run, whereas no differences were noted for normalized power of MHC IIa fibers. These data indicate that highly trained endurance runners have elevated contraction velocity in both slow- and fast-twitch myofibers. These characteristics of the fast-twitch muscle fibers have not been previously reported in competitive endurance athletes and may contribute to the high level of running performance in these athletes.",2008,105,2,629-36,10.1152/japplphysiol.00995.2007,#2840,Harber 2008,

Here we used UT shear modulus measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography as an index of muscle stiffness/tension. The aims of this study were twofold: 1) to determine whether the UT muscle shear modulus is altered in athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy compared to asymptomatic athletes, and 2) to detect optimal cut-off points of UT shear modulus in identifying athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy. Forty-three male volleyball players (17 asymptomatic and 26 with rotator cuff tendinopathy, mean age = 22.9±3.5 years) participated in the study. UT shear modulus was quantified during active arm holding at 30° and 60° of shoulder abduction and passive arm positioning at 0°, 30° and 60° of shoulder abduction. During the active tasks, the UT shear modulus was higher in athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy than the asymptomatic athletes (p = 0.002), regardless the arm position. During the passive tasks, athletes with rotator cuff tendinopathy exhibited a higher UT shear modulus than asymptomatic athletes only at 0° of shoulder abduction (13.0±2.5 kPa vs 10.2±1.8 kPa, p = 0.001). When considering the active task, an optimal cut-off shear modulus of 12.0 kPa at 30° of shoulder abduction (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 0.57, AUC = 0.757, p = 0.008) and 9.5 kPa at 60° of shoulder abduction (sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.67, AUC = 0.816, p = 0.002) was detected. When considering the passive task at 0° of shoulder abduction, a cut-off of 12.2 kPa was found (sensitivity = 0.73, AUC = 0.817, p = 0.001). Findings from the present study show that monitoring passive and active UT muscle shear modulus may provide important information for the prevention/rehabilitation of rotator cuff tendinopathy.",2016,11,5,e0155187,10.1371/journal.pone.0155187,#2841,Leong 2016,
180,20541763.0,Individual-specific muscle maximum force estimation using ultrasound for ankle joint torque prediction using an EMG-driven Hill-type model.,J Biomech,"EMG-driven models can be used to estimate muscle force in biomechanical systems. Collected and processed EMG readings are used as the input of a dynamic system, which is integrated numerically. This approach requires the definition of a reasonably large set of parameters. Some of these vary widely among subjects, and slight inaccuracies in such parameters can lead to large model output errors. One of these parameters is the maximum voluntary contraction force (F(om)). This paper proposes an approach to find F(om) by estimating muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) using ultrasound (US), which is multiplied by a realistic value of maximum muscle specific tension. Ultrasound is used to measure muscle thickness, which allows for the determination of muscle volume through regression equations. Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis PCSAs are estimated using published volume proportions among leg muscles, which also requires measurements of muscle fiber length and pennation angle by US. F(om) obtained by this approach and from data widely cited in the literature was used to comparatively test a Hill-type EMG-driven model of the ankle joint. The model uses 3 EMGs (Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis) as inputs with joint torque as the output. The EMG signals were obtained in a series of experiments carried out with 8 adult male subjects, who performed an isometric contraction protocol consisting of 10s step contractions at 20% and 60% of the maximum voluntary contraction level. Isometric torque was simultaneously collected using a dynamometer. A statistically significant reduction in the root mean square error was observed when US-obtained F(om) was used, as compared to F(om) from the literature.",2010,43,14,2816-21,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.05.035,#2842,deOliveira 2010,
181,25390896.0,Are subject-specific musculoskeletal models robust to the uncertainties in parameter identification?,PLoS One,"Subject-specific musculoskeletal modeling can be applied to study musculoskeletal disorders, allowing inclusion of personalized anatomy and properties. Independent of the tools used for model creation, there are unavoidable uncertainties associated with parameter identification, whose effect on model predictions is still not fully understood. The aim of the present study was to analyze the sensitivity of subject-specific model predictions (i.e., joint angles, joint moments, muscle and joint contact forces) during walking to the uncertainties in the identification of body landmark positions, maximum muscle tension and musculotendon geometry. To this aim, we created an MRI-based musculoskeletal model of the lower limbs, defined as a 7-segment, 10-degree-of-freedom articulated linkage, actuated by 84 musculotendon units. We then performed a Monte-Carlo probabilistic analysis perturbing model parameters according to their uncertainty, and solving a typical inverse dynamics and static optimization problem using 500 models that included the different sets of perturbed variable values. Model creation and gait simulations were performed by using freely available software that we developed to standardize the process of model creation, integrate with OpenSim and create probabilistic simulations of movement. The uncertainties in input variables had a moderate effect on model predictions, as muscle and joint contact forces showed maximum standard deviation of 0.3 times body-weight and maximum range of 2.1 times body-weight. In addition, the output variables significantly correlated with few input variables (up to 7 out of 312) across the gait cycle, including the geometry definition of larger muscles and the maximum muscle tension in limited gait portions. Although we found subject-specific models not markedly sensitive to parameter identification, researchers should be aware of the model precision in relation to the intended application. In fact, force predictions could be affected by an uncertainty in the same order of magnitude of its value, although this condition has low probability to occur.",2014,9,11,e112625,10.1371/journal.pone.0112625,#2843,Valente 2014,

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stiffness and lengths of gastrocnemius muscle-tendon units, lengths of muscle fascicles, and tendons at specific tensions. RESULTS: At a tension of 100N, the gastrocnemius muscle-tendon unit was significantly shorter in participants with stroke (mean, 436mm) than in able-bodied control participants (mean, 444mm; difference, 8mm; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2-15mm; P=.04). Muscle fascicles were also shorter in the stroke group (mean, 44mm) than in the control group (mean, 50mm; difference, 6mm; 95% CI, 1-12mm; P=.03). There were no significant differences between groups in the mean stiffness or length of the muscle-tendon units and fascicles at low tension, or in the mean length of the tendons at any tension.

Additionally, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of each method using a binary classifier in confusion matrix and convenience of discrimination, based on the time required for interpretation. Method One normophonic male, 12 patients with diplophonia, and 12 dysphonia patients without diplophonia were enrolled. A multimodal simultaneous evaluation was used to analyze the vibration pattern of diplophonia. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the curve, and interpretation time were used to compare the various diagnostic methods. Discrimination was determined by 3 raters. Results There are 3 types of asymmetric vibratory patterns in diplophonia. The types are based on the oscillators vibrating at different frequencies: asymmetry of the left and right cords (6 subjects with unilateral palsy and 1 subject with vocal polyps), asymmetry of anterior and posterior cords (2 subjects with vocal polyps), and asymmetry of true and false cords (3 subjects with muscle tension dysphonia). All evaluation methods were useful as diagnostic tools, with all areas under the curve > .70. The diagnostic accuracy was highest with DKG (95.83%), followed by 2D DKG (83.33%), EGG (81.94%), auditory-perceptual evaluation (80.56%), and sound waveform (77.78%). The interpretation time was the shortest for auditory-perceptual evaluation (6.07 ± 1.34 s), followed by 2D DKG (10.04 ± 3.00 s), EGG (12.49 ± 2.76 s), and DKG (13.53 ± 2.60 s). Conclusions Auditory-perceptual judgment was the easiest and fastest method for experienced raters, but its diagnostic accuracy was lower than that of DKG or 2D DKG. The diagnostic accuracy of DKG was the highest, but 2D DKG allowed rapid interpretation and showed relatively high diagnostic accuracy, except in cases with space-occupying lesions.

185,28488136.0,Bilateral differences in muscle fascicle architecture are not related to the preferred leg in jumping athletes.,Eur J Appl Physiol,"PURPOSE: In many sports, athletes have a preferred leg for sport-specific tasks, such as jumping, which leads to strength differences between both legs, yet the underlying changes in force-generating mechanical properties of the muscle remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the muscle architecture of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) is different between both legs in well-trained jumping athletes and untrained individuals. In addition, we investigated the effect of two ankle joint positions on ultrasound muscle architecture measurements. METHODS: Muscle architecture of both legs was measured in 16 athletes and 11 untrained individuals at two ankle joint angles: one with the ankle joint in a tendon slack length (TSL) angle and one in a 90° angle. RESULTS: Fascicle lengths and pennation angles at TSL were not different between the preferred and non-preferred legs in either group. The comparison between groups showed no difference in fascicle length, but greater pennation angles were found in the athletes (21.7° ± 0.5°) compared to the untrained individuals (19.8° ± 0.6°). Analyses of the muscle architecture at a 90° angle yielded different results, mainly in the comparison between groups. CONCLUSION: These results provide only partial support for the notion of training-induced changes in muscle architecture as only differences in pennation angles were found between athletes and untrained individuals. Furthermore, our results provide support to the recommendation to take into account the tension-length relationship and to measure muscle architecture at individually determined tendon slack joint angles.",2017,117,7,1453-1461,10.1007/s00421-017-3638-5,#2848,Aeles 2017,Athletes
186,16768033.0,[Clinical consequences of muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].,Nutr Hosp,"The function of respiratory muscles, and mainly inspiratory muscles, is impaired in COPD patients. Most of these impairments are essentially due to pulmonary hyperinflation that puts these muscles in a disadvantageous situation. The main consequence of this dysfunction is respiratory muscle fatigue that may cause shortness of breath, exertion intolerance, and hypoventilation with onset of hypercapnic respiratory failure. This function may be measured at the pulmonary function laboratory by means of unspecific (spirometry, pulmonary volumes) or specific tests (maxim respiratory pressures [MIP - M], transdiaphragmatic pressure, tension-time index of the diaphragm, electromyography, or endura tests). Therapy should aim at improving hyperinflation with bronchodilator therapy, improving muscular strength with rehabilitation, and in severe cases muscle rest with mechanical ventilation. Peripheral muscle dysfunction is a common complication in moderate-severe COPD, and it may be the result of chronic inactivity, hypoxemia, electrolytic impairments, under nutrition, steroids, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation. Besides, it may contribute to patients' quality of life worsening, disability, and even an increase in morbimortality. It may tested by impedanciometry, muscle strength tests (dynamometry), imaging tests, and even muscle biopsy in research studies. Peripheral muscle dysfunction is potentially manageable with rehabilitation, nutritional supplementation, and anabolic drugs.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. METHODS: We measured the average muscle stiffness over multiple neck extensor muscles and in regions corresponding approximately to the trapezius, splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, and multifidus muscles using ultrasound shear wave elastography in 20 women with chronic nonspecific neck pain and 18 asymptomatic women during multiple tasks. The measurements were automatically quality controlled and computer processed over the complete visible neck region or a large muscle-specific region. RESULTS: Pooled over all tasks, neck muscle stiffness was not significantly different between those with neck pain and asymptomatic controls (neck pain median, 11.6 kPa; interquartile range, 8.9 kPa and control median, 13.3 kPa; interquartile range, 8.6 kPa; P = .175). The measure of neck muscle stiffness was not correlated with the intensity of neck pain or perceived disability. CONCLUSION: Shear wave elastography revealed similar muscle stiffness in people with and without chronic neck pain, despite the sensation of increased neck stiffness in those with chronic neck pain. Therapeutic interventions aiming to reduce neck muscle tone are often based on the assumption that perceived neck stiffness corresponds to objective muscle stiffness.

188,7657677.0,Tendon biomechanical properties enhance human wrist muscle specialization.,J Biomech,"Biomechanical properties of human wrist tendons were measured under loads predicted to be experienced by those tendons under physiological conditions. This was accomplished by measuring the architectural properties of the five prime wrist movers--extensors carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), flexor carpi radials (FCR), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU)--and predicting their maximum tension (P0) using a specific tension value (22.5 N cm-2. Loading the corresponding tendons to P0 resulted in significantly different strain among tendons (p < 0.01) with the largest strain observed in the FCU (3.68 +/- 0.31%) and the smallest strain observed in the ECRL (1.78 +/- 0.14%). Further, strain magnitude was significantly positively correlated with the tendon length-to-fiber length ratio of the muscle-tendon unit, a measure of the intrinsic compliance of the muscle-tendon unit. Theoretical modeling of the magnitude of muscle sarcomere shortening expected based on the measured biomechanical properties revealed a maximum sarcomere length decrease of about 0.6 micron for the FCU to a minimum of about 0.2 micron for the ECRB at P0. Thus, tendon compliance may, but does not necessarily, result in significant modification of muscle force generation. The significant variation in tendon biomechanical properties was not observed using traditional elongation-to-failure methods on the same specimens. Thus, the use of elongation-to-failure experiments for determination of tendon properties may not be reasonable when the purpose of such studies is to infer physiological function. These data indicate that muscle-tendon units show remarkable specialization and that tendon intrinsic properties accentuate the muscle architectural specialization already present.",1995,28,7,791-9,10.1016/0021-9290(94)00137-s,#2851,Loren 1995,
189,3759774.0,Breathlessness during exercise with and without resistive loading.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"The purpose of this study was to quantify the intensity of breathlessness associated with exercise and respiratory resistive loading, with the specific purpose of isolating the quantitative contributions of inspiratory pressure, length, velocity, and frequency of inspiratory muscle shortening and duty cycle to breathlessness. The intensity of inspiratory pressure was quantified by measurement of estimated esophageal pressure (Pes = pressure at the mouth plus lung pressure), the extent of shortening by tidal volume (VT), and the velocity of shortening by inspiratory flow rate (VI). Six normal subjects underwent five incremental (100 kpm X min-1 X min-1) exercise tests on a cycle ergometer to maximum capacity. The first and last test were unloaded and the intervening tests were performed with external added resistances of 33, 57, and 73 cm H2O X l-1 X s in random order. The resistances were selected to provide a range of pressures, tidal volumes, flow rates, and patterns of breathing. At rest and at the end of each minute during exercise the subjects estimated the intensity of breathlessness (psi) by selecting a number ranging from 0 to 10 (Borg rating scale, 0 indicating no appreciable breathlessness and 10 the maximum tolerable sensation). Breathlessness was significantly and independently related to Pes (P less than 0.0001), VI (P less than 0.0001), frequency of breathing (fb) (P less than 0.01), and duty cycle [ratio of inspiratory duration to total breath duration (TI/TT)] (P less than 0.01): psi = 0.11 Pes + 0.61 VI + 1.99 TI/TT + 0.04 fb - 2.60 (r = 0.83). The results suggest that peak pressure (tension), VI (velocity of inspiratory muscle shortening), TI/TT, and fb contribute independently and collectively to breathlessness. The perception of respiratory muscle effort is ideally suited to subserve this sensation. The neurophysiological mechanism purported is a conscious awareness of the intensity of the outgoing motor command by means of corollary discharge within the central nervous system.",1986,61,3,896-905,10.1152/jappl.1986.61.3.896,#2852,el-Manshawi 1986,
190,25480801.0,Quantifying inter-species differences in contractile function through biophysical modelling.,J Physiol,"Animal models and measurements are frequently used to guide and evaluate clinical interventions. In this context, knowledge of inter-species differences in physiology is crucial for understanding the limitations and relevance of animal experimental assays for informing clinical applications. Extensive effort has been put into studying the structure and function of cardiac contractile proteins and how differences in these translate into the functional properties of muscles. However, integrating this knowledge into a quantitative description, formalising and highlighting inter-species differences both in the kinetics and in the regulation of physiological mechanisms, remains challenging. In this study we propose and apply a novel approach for the quantification of inter-species differences between mouse, rat and human. Assuming conservation of the fundamental physiological mechanisms underpinning contraction, biophysically based computational models are fitted to simulate experimentally recorded phenotypes from multiple species. The phenotypic differences between species are then succinctly quantified as differences in the biophysical model parameter values. This provides the potential of quantitatively establishing the human relevance of both animal-based experimental and computational models for application in a clinical context. Our results indicate that the parameters related to the sensitivity and cooperativity of calcium binding to troponin C and the activation and relaxation rates of tropomyosin/crossbridge binding kinetics differ most significantly between mouse, rat and human, while for example the reference tension, as expected, shows only minor differences between the species. Hence, while confirming expected inter-species differences in calcium sensitivity due to large differences in the observed calcium transients, our results also indicate more unexpected differences in the cooperativity mechanism. Specifically, the decrease in the unbinding rate of calcium to troponin C with increasing active tension was much lower for mouse than for rat and human. Our results also predicted crossbridge binding to be slowest in human and fastest in mouse.",2015,593,5,1083-111,10.1113/jphysiol.2014.279232,#2854,TÃ¸ndel 2015,
191,8744258.0,Muscle mechanics: adaptations with exercise-training.,Exerc Sport Sci Rev,"Based on the MHC isoform pattern, adult mammalian limb skeletal muscles contain two and, in some species, three types of fast fibers (Type IIa, IIx, and IIb), and one slow fiber (Type I). Slow muscles, such as the soleus, contain primarily the slow Type I fiber, whereas fast-twitch muscles are composed primarily of a mixture of the fast myosin isozymes. Force generation involves cross-bridge interaction and transition from a weakly bound, low-force state (AM-ADP-P(i)) to the strongly bound, high-force state (AM-ADP). This transition is thought to be rate limiting in terms of dP/dt, and the high-force state is the dominant cross-bridge form during a peak isometric contraction. Intact fast and slow skeletal muscles generate approximately the same amount of peak force (Po) of between 200 and 250 kN.m-2. However, the rate of transition from the low- to high-force state shows Ca2+ sensitivity and is 7-fold higher in fast-twitch, as compared to slow-twitch, skeletal muscle fibers. Fiber Vo or the maximal cross-bridge cycle rate is highly correlated with and thought to be dependent on the specific activity of the myosin or myofibrillar ATPase. The hierarchy for Vo is the Type IIb > IIx > IIa > I. This functional difference for the fast fiber types explains the higher Vo observed in the predominantly Type IIb SVL vs. the mixed fast Type IIa and IIb EDL muscle. A plot of Vo vs. species size demonstrates that an inverse relationship exists between Vo and body mass. From the standpoint of work capacity, the important property is power output. An analysis of individual muscles indicates that peak power is obtained at loads considerably below 50% of Po. Individuals with a high percentage of fast-twitch fibers generate a greater torque and higher power at a given velocity than those with predominantly slow-twitch fibers. In humans, mean peak power occurred in a ratio of 10:5:1 for the Type IIb, IIa, and I fibers. The in vivo measurement of the torque-velocity relationship and Vmax in human muscle is difficult because of limitations inherent in the equipment used and the inability to study the large limb muscles independently. Nevertheless, the in vivo torque-velocity relationships are similar to those measured in vitro in animals. This observation suggests that little central nervous system inhibition exists and that healthy subjects are able to achieve maximal activation of their muscles. Although peak isometric tension is not dependent on fiber type distribution, a positive correlation exists between the percentage of fast fibers and peak torque output at moderate-to-high angular isokinetic velocities. Consequently, peak power output is substantially greater in subjects possessing a predominance of fast fibers. The mechanical properties of slow and fast muscles do adapt to programs of regular exercise. Endurance exercise training has been shown to increase the Vo of the slow soleus by 20%. This increase could have been caused by either a small increase in all, or most, of the fibers, or to a conversion of a few fibers from slow to fast. Recently, the increase was shown to be caused by the former, as the individual slow Type I fibers of the soleus showed a 20% increase in Vo, but there was little or no change in the percentage of fast fibers. The increased Vo was correlated with, and likely caused by, an increased fiber ATPase. We hypothesize that the increased ATPase and cross-bridge cycling speed might be attributable to an increased expression of fast MLCs in the slow Type I fibers (Fig. 14.10). This hypothesis is based on the fact that light chains have been shown to be involved in the power stroke, and removal of light chains depresses force and velocity. Regular endurance exercise training had no effect on fiber size, but with prolonged durations of daily training it depressed Po and peak power. When the training is maintained over prolonged periods, it may even induce atrophy of the slow Type I and fast Type IIa fibers. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",1996,24,,427-73,,#2855,Fitts 1996,
192,16209907.0,Passive muscle stiffness may be influenced by active contractility of intramuscular connective tissue.,Med Hypotheses,"The article introduces the hypothesis that intramuscular connective tissue, in particular the fascial layer known as the perimysium, may be capable of active contraction and consequently influence passive muscle stiffness, especially in tonic muscles. Passive muscle stiffness is also referred to as passive elasticity, passive muscular compliance, passive extensibility, resting tension, or passive muscle tone. Evidence for the hypothesis is based on five indications: (1) tonic muscles contain more perimysium and are therefore stiffer than phasic muscles; (2) the specific collagen arrangement of the perimysium is designed to fit a load-bearing function; (3) morphological considerations as well as histological observations in our laboratory suggest that the perimysium is characterized by a high density of myofibroblasts, a class of fibroblasts with smooth muscle-like contractile kinetics; (4) in vitro contraction tests with fascia have demonstrated that fascia, due to the presence of myofibroblasts, is able to actively contract, and that the resulting contraction forces may be strong enough to influence musculoskeletal dynamics; (5) the pronounced increase of the perimysium in muscle immobilization and in the surgical treatment of distraction osteogenesis indicates that perimysial stiffness adapts to mechanical stimulation and hence influences passive muscle stiffness. In conclusion, the perimysium seems capable of response to mechanostimulation with a myofibroblast facilitated active tissue contraction, thereby adapting passive muscle stiffness to increased tensional demands, especially in tonic musculature. If verified, this new concept may lead to novel pharmaceutical or mechanical approaches to complement existing treatments of pathologies which are accompanied by an increase or decrease of passive muscle stiffness (e.g., muscle fibroses such as torticollis, peri-partum pelvic pain due to pelvic instability, and many others). Methods for testing this new concept are suggested, including histological examinations and specific in vitro contraction tests.",2006,66,1,66-71,10.1016/j.mehy.2005.08.025,#2856,Schleip 2006,
193,30508296.0,A new propeller trapezius muscle flap for reconstruction of posterior trunk defects: An anatomic study and report of three cases.,Microsurgery,"BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of complex back defects, especially after corrective spine surgery, is a challenging problem. In these patients hardware issues predominate and flap failure has serious consequences. Certain subunits of the back pose even greater problems, specifically the central region between T9 and T12. The purpose of this article is to present a novel technique for reconstruction of such spinal defects using a newly described trapezius muscle propeller flap based on the dorsal scapular vessels. METHODS: Four cadaveric trapezius muscle propeller flaps were raised to ensure appropriate rotation into central region of the posterior trunk between T9 and T12. Three patients all had similar presentations with a history of scoliosis, previous failed spinal instrumentation, prominent hardware, impending exposure, worsening kyphosis, and back pain. The patients underwent planned extension fusions from the upper thoracic to lumbar vertebrae by orthopedic surgery. All three patients lacked local reconstructive options and propeller trapezius muscle flaps were dissected. RESULTS: All cadaveric dissections demonstrated adequate rotation of the muscle flap without tension or kinking of the vascular pedicle. For the case studies, two patients had right sided trapezius flaps utilized, one patient had injury to the right dorsal scapular vessels during dissection, thus a left sided trapezius was rotated. One patient had complications including a seroma requiring aspiration and superficial wound breakdown. All had complete healing with no postoperative shoulder dysfunction noted. CONCLUSION: As a result, the trapezius muscle propeller flap is found to be a novel flap that provides a simple, yet robust solution to an otherwise difficult reconstructive problem.",2019,39,5,428-433,10.1002/micr.30395,#2857,Meyerson 2019,
194,20188736.0,Mechanical stress-induced sarcomere assembly for cardiac muscle growth in length and width.,J Mol Cell Cardiol,"A ventricular myocyte experiences changes in length and load during every beat of the heart and has the ability to remodel cell shape to maintain cardiac performance. Specifically, myocytes elongate in response to increased diastolic strain by adding sarcomeres in series, and they thicken in response to continued systolic stress by adding filaments in parallel. Myocytes do this while still keeping the resting sarcomere length close to its optimal value at the peak of the length-tension curve. This review focuses on the little understood mechanisms by which direction of growth is matched in a physiologically appropriate direction. We propose that the direction of strain is detected by differential phosphorylation of proteins in the costamere, which then transmit signaling to the Z-disc for parallel or series addition of thin filaments regulated via the actin capping processes. In this review, we link mechanotransduction to the molecular mechanisms for regulation of myocyte length and width.",2010,48,5,817-23,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2010.02.016,#2858,Russell 2010,
195,19724891.0,"Effects of local vibrations on skeletal muscle trophism in elderly people: mechanical, cellular, and molecular events.",Int J Mol Med,"Several studies have examined the effects of vibrations on muscle mass and performance in young healthy people. We studied the effects of vibrations on muscles of elderly male and female volunteers (65-85 years of age) diagnosed with sarcopenia. We applied mechanical vibrations locally (local vibrational training) to the thigh muscles at 300 Hz for a period of 12 weeks, starting with a session of 15 min stimulation once a week and increasing to three sessions of 15 min per week. Treated muscles displayed enhanced maximal isometric strength and increased content of fast MyHC-2X myosin. Single muscle fiber analysis did not show any change in cross-sectional area or in specific tension. Analysis of transcriptional profiles by microarray revealed changes in gene expression after 12 weeks of local vibrational training. In particular, pathways related with energy metabolism, sarcomeric protein balance and oxidative stress response were affected. We conclude that vibration treatment is effective in counteracting the loss of muscular strength associated with sarcopenia and the mode of action of vibration is based on cellular and molecular changes which do not include increase in fiber or muscle size.",2009,24,4,503-12,10.3892/ijmm_00000259,#2859,Pietrangelo 2009,

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a noninvasive assessment of TTI, the respiratory muscle tension time index (TTmus), by comparison to that of the diaphragm tension time index (TTdi) and other predictors of extubation outcome in ventilated children. METHODS: Eighty children (median [range] age 2.1 yr [0.15-16]) admitted to pediatric intensive care units at King's College and St Mary's Hospitals who required mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours were studied. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: TTmus, maximal inspiratory pressure, respiratory drive, respiratory system mechanics, and functional residual capacity using a helium dilution technique, the rapid shallow breathing and CROP indices (compliance, rate, oxygenation, and pressure) indexed for body weight were measured and standard clinical data recorded in all patients. TTdi was measured in 28 of the 80 children using balloon catheters. Eight children (three in the TTdi group) failed extubation. TTmus (0.199 vs. 0.09) and TTdi (0.157 vs. 0.07) were significantly higher in children who failed extubation. TTmus greater than 0.18 (n = 80) and TTdi greater than 0.15 (n = 28) had sensitivities and specificities of 100% in predicting extubation failure. The other predictors performed less well. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive and noninvasive measurements of TTI may provide accurate prediction of extubation outcome in mechanically ventilated children.",2009,180,10,982-8,10.1164/rccm.200811-1725OC,#2860,Harikumar 2009,

Functionally, most leg muscles work eccentrically for some part of a normal gait cycle, to support the weight of the body against gravity and to absorb shock. During downhill running the role of eccentric work of the 'anti-gravity' muscles--knee extensors, muscles of the anterior and posterior tibial compartments and hip extensors--is accentuated.

198,14986072.0,Stabilization of the sacroiliac joint in vivo: verification of muscular contribution to force closure of the pelvis.,Eur Spine J,"A model of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) function postulates that SIJ shear is prevented by friction, dynamically influenced by muscle force and ligament tension. Thus, SIJ stability can be accommodated to specific loading situations. The purpose of this study was to examine, in vivo, whether muscles contribute to force closure of the SIJ. SIJ stiffness was measured using a verified method combining color Doppler imaging with induced oscillation of the ilium relative to the sacrum in six healthy women. SIJ stiffness was measured both in a relaxed situation and during isometric voluntary contractions (electromyographically recorded). The biceps femoris, gluteus maximus, erector spinae, and contralateral latissimus dorsi were included in this study. Results were statistically analyzed. The study showed that SIJ stiffness significantly increased when the individual muscles were activated. This held especially true for activation of the erector spinae, the biceps femoris and the gluteus maximus muscles. During some tests significant co-contraction of other muscles occurred. The finding that SIJ stiffness increased even with slight muscle activity supports the notion that effectiveness of load transfer from spine to legs is improved when muscle forces actively compress the SIJ, preventing shear. When joints are manually tested, the influence of muscle activation patterns must be considered, since both inter- and intra-tester reliability of the test can be affected by muscle activity. In this respect, the relation between emotional states, muscle activity and joint stiffness deserves further exploration.",2004,13,3,199-205,10.1007/s00586-003-0575-2,#2862,vanWingerden 2004,

Although the response to phenylephrine (PE) is dependent on the quality of smooth muscle (SM) within the prostate, it is not clear whether the response to ET-1 is also influenced by SM density. We evaluate the relationship between contractile responsiveness to ET-1 and the area density of SM of the human prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens were obtained from 17 patients with prostatic hyperplasia that underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. Specimens were used for isometric tension study (PE, KCl and ET) and also for quantitative morphometric analysis. RESULTS: PE and ET-1 induced dose-dependent contractile responses. There were no significant differences in the average maximum response (E(max)) to these two agents. E(max) to KCl and PE showed direct positive correlations with the area density of SM. E(max) to ET-1 also showed a positive correlation with the SM density, although this relationship was weaker than those for the other two agents. Moreover, there was a strong positive relationship between E(max) to PE, KCl and that to ET-1. CONCLUSIONS: The area density of SM appeared to significantly influence the contractile response to ET-1 as well as the response to PE and KCl.",2000,37,4,494-8,10.1159/000020174,#2863,Ishigooka 2000,
200,31290036.0,EMG-Informed Musculoskeletal Modeling to Estimate Realistic Knee Anterior Shear Force During Drop Vertical Jump in Female Athletes.,Ann Biomed Eng,"The anterior cruciate ligament is the primary structural restraint to tibial anterior shear force. The anterior force occurring at the knee during landing contributes to anterior cruciate ligament injury risk, but it cannot be directly measured experimentally. The objective of this study was to develop electromyography-informed musculoskeletal simulations of the drop vertical jump motor task and assess the contribution of knee muscle forces to tibial anterior shear force. In this cross-sectional study, musculoskeletal simulations were used to estimate the muscle forces of thirteen female athletes performing a drop vertical jump using an electromyography-informed method. Muscle activation and knee loads that resulted from these simulations were compared to the results obtained with the more common approach of minimization of muscle effort (optimization-based method). Quadriceps-hamstrings and quadriceps-gastrocnemius co-contractions were progressively increased and their contribution to anterior shear force was quantified. The electromyography-informed method produced co-contraction indexes more consistent with electromyography data than the optimization-based method. The muscles that presented the largest contribution to peak anterior shear force were the gastrocnemii, likely from their wrapping around the posterior aspect of the tibia. The quadriceps-hamstring co-contraction provided a protective effect on the ACL and reduced peak anterior shear force by 292 N with a co-contraction index increase of 25% from baseline (31%), whereas a quadriceps-gastrocnemius co-contraction index of 61% increased peak anterior shear force by 797 N compared to baseline (42%). An increase in gastrocnemius contraction, which might be required to protect the ankle from the impact with the ground, produced a large quadriceps-gastrocnemius co-activation, increasing peak anterior shear force. A better understanding of each muscle's contribution to anterior shear force and, consequently, anterior cruciate ligament tension may inform subject-specific injury prevention programs and rehabilitation protocols.",2019,47,12,2416-2430,10.1007/s10439-019-02318-w,#2864,Navacchia 2019,ACL
201,16002556.0,Deficiency of alpha-sarcoglycan differently affects fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscles.,Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,"Alpha-sarcoglycan (Sgca) is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the dystrophin complex located at skeletal and cardiac muscle sarcolemma. Defects in the alpha-sarcoglycan gene (Sgca) cause the severe human-type 2D limb girdle muscular dystrophy. Because Sgca-null mice develop progressive muscular dystrophy similar to human disorder they are a valuable animal model for investigating the physiopathology of the disorder. In this study, biochemical and functional properties of fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and slow-twitch soleus muscles of the Sgca-null mice were analyzed. EDL muscle of Sgca-null mice showed twitch and tetanic kinetics comparable with those of wild-type controls. In contrast, soleus muscle showed reduction of twitch half-relaxation time, prolongation of tetanic half-relaxation time, and increase of maximal rate of rise of tetanus. EDL muscle of Sgca-null mice demonstrated a marked reduction of specific twitch and tetanic tensions and a higher resistance to fatigue compared with controls, changes that were not evident in dystrophic soleus. Contrary to EDL fibers, soleus muscle fibers of Sgca-null mice distinctively showed right shift of the pCa-tension (pCa is the negative log of Ca2+ concentration) relationships and reduced sensitivity to caffeine of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Both EDL and soleus muscles showed striking changes in myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoform composition, whereas EDL showed a larger number of hybrid fibers than soleus. In contrast to the EDL, soleus muscle of Sgca-null mice contained a higher number of regenerating fibers and thus higher levels of embryonic MHC. In conclusion, this study revealed profound distinctive biochemical and physiological modifications in fast- and slow-twitch muscles resulting from alpha-sarcoglycan deficiency.",2005,289,5,R1328-37,10.1152/ajpregu.00673.2004,#2866,Danieli-Betto 2005,

The data indicated: (a) both subjects obtained an ability to control BVP during BVP feedback and EMG during EMG feedback; (b) there were decreases in frequency of migraine headaches during BVP feedback and decreases in muscle contraction headaches during EMG feedback. The results of this study supported the theoretical explanation of two pain mechanisms involved in combined muscle contraction-migraine headaches as well as the effectiveness of bio-feedback procedures that target directly the specific pain mechanism in the elimination of the two types of head pain.,1978,11,2,215-23,10.1901/jaba.1978.11-215,#2867,Sturgis 1978,
203,15025631.0,The influence of amphotericin B and neomycin on the effect of human relaxin-2 on foetal membranes and isolated myometrium.,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,"In vitro studies have documented effects of relaxin on utero-placental tissues. Previously unpublished experiments indicate that neomycin and amphotericin B in vitro influences the effect of human relaxin-2 on the strength of human foetal membranes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the interaction between neomycin and amphotericin B and human relaxin-2 using human foetal membranes, human myometrium and rat myometrium. Chloramphenicol, erythromycin and penicillin were also examined. Human foetal membranes were stretched until rupture in a materials-testing machine while the contractility of rat and human myometrium were examined by myography. Human relaxin-2 (hrlx-2, 10(-9) M) induced a decreased strength in human foetal membranes, although this effect of hrlx-2 was inhibited after co-incubation with neomycin and amphotericin B. Hrlx-2 (10(-9) M) in combination with chloramphenicol induced a decreased strength of human foetal membranes. Hrlx-2 (10(-9) M) decreased myometrial contractility on amplitude and frequency in the rat myometrium, but had no effect on baseline tension. After exposure to amphotericin B, hrlx-2 induced a more pronounced decrease in amplitude, increased baseline tension and increased the frequency of contractions of the rat myometrium. Hrlx-2 (10(-9) M) had no effect on the human myometrium. However, after exposure to amphotericin B or neomycin+amphotericin B, hrlx-2 induced an increase in baseline tension and a decrease in amplitude. Amphotericin B and neomycin+amphotericin B increased the frequency of contractions and this effect was further enhanced by the addition of hrlx-2. We therefore conclude that amphotericin B and neomycin + amphotericin B may have an influence on relaxin's effect on isolated foetal membranes and myometrium.",2004,94,3,144-50,10.1111/j.1742-7843.2004.pto940308.x,#2868,Vogel 2004,
204,8729683.0,"Na+, K(+)-pump activity and skeletal muscle contractile deficits in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.",Acta Physiol Scand,"Skeletal muscles in an animal model of genetic hypertension (the spontaneously hypertensive rat. SHR) exhibit significant deficits in contractile performance. These deficits appear to be unrelated to the rise in blood pressure. Slow-twitch soleus muscles show a decrease in specific muscle tension and a reduced resistance to muscle fatigue during prolonged contractile activity. We tested the hypothesis that the reduced fatigue resistance occurs as a consequence of an impaired ability to maintain or restore Na+ and K+ balance across the sarcolemma during repeated contractions. This may result from a genetically based increase in the Na+ permeability of SHR muscles, coupled with a reduction Na+, K+ pump capacity as the animals mature. Soleus muscles in adult SHR exhibit a significant increase in intracellular Na+ content and a significant decrease in intracellular K+ content at rest. B6RB+ uptake in Na(+)-loaded hypertensive muscles is 45% less than predicted from the number of ouabain-binding sites available. Activation of Na+, K+ pumps using adrenaline or insulin produces a significantly smaller hyperpolarization in hypertensive soleus than in control muscles. Control soleus muscles are hyperpolarized for at least 10 min after a 4 min period of high-frequency activity, but hypertensive soleus muscles remain at resting polarity. Nonetheless, the number of ouabain-binding sites in hypertensive muscle is significantly greater than in control soleus, and binding affinities are similar. This apparent deficit in pump capacity might lead to a greater and more prolonged increase in extracellular K+ during repetitive contractions,and an associated decline in tension. Recently, we have been able to prevent the abnormal decrease in hypertensive soleus fatigue resistance by long-term treatment (8 weeks) with the Ca2+ blocker amlodipine. The therapy prevented or reversed the contractile deficits, but did not restore the responsiveness of the Na+, K+ pump to hormonal stimulation. The current data suggest that both a reduction in Na+, K(+)-pump capacity and changes in Ca2+ distribution play a role in the development of contractile deficits in hypertensive muscles.",1996,156,3,237-45,10.1046/j.1365-201X.1996.195000.x,#2869,Carlsen 1996,
205,22375910.0,Rho kinase (ROK)-related proteins in human cavernous arteries: an immunohistochemical and functional approach.,J Sex Med,"INTRODUCTION: Rho kinases (ROKs) cause calcium-independent modulation of smooth muscle contraction. A significant role for the RhoA/ROK pathway in mediating the contraction of the penile erectile tissue has been suggested. Moreover, it has been postulated that ROK activity might represent a key factor in the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction. Up until today, little is known on the significance of ROK and related proteins in the control of blood flow in the corpus cavernosum. AIM: To investigate by means of immunohistochemistry and organ bath studies the significance of the Rho pathway in human cavernous arteries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The expression of ROK1, ROK2, RhoA, and RhoGDI in human cavernous arteries was investigated by means of immunohistochemistry; myographic studies were conducted in order to characterize the effects of the ROK inhibitor Y27632 on isolated cavernous arteries. METHODS: Specimens of human cavernous arteries were processed for immunohistochemistry for ROK1, ROK2, RhoA, and RhoGDI. Circular penile vascular segments were mounted in a tissue bath and the effects of increasing concentrations of the ROK inhibitor Y27632 on the tension induced by norepinephrine (NE, 1 µM) were investigated. RESULTS: Alpha-actin immunoreactive cavernous arterioles also presented abundant staining specific for ROK1, ROK2, RhoA, and RhoGDI in the smooth musculature of the vascular wall. Cumulative addition of Y27632 dose-dependently reversed the tension induced by NE of isolated arterial segments. Y27632 produced relaxant responses with a reversion of tension of 34.3 ± 11.8% at a concentration of 1 µM. CONCLUSION: The findings are in support for a role of the Rho/ROK-mediated signaling in the regulation of muscle tone of human cavernous arteries.",2012,9,5,1337-43,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02662.x,#2870,Waldkirch 2012,

In the pallid bat, Antrozous pallidus, there is an extensive plexus of large interconnected blood sinuses in the part of the annulus that borders the tympanic bone. The spaces between the sinuses are packed with smooth muscle cells. Most of the cells have a predominately radial orientation; they extend from the bony tympanic sulcus to a dense collagenous matrix (apical zone) where radially oriented fibers of the pars tensa are confluent with the annulus. The muscles and vessels constitute a myovascular zone. A structurally similar myovascular zone is also present in the European hedgehog. In rodents, the annulus lacks the large interconnected blood sinuses but many small vessels are present. Smooth muscle is concentrated in the broad area of attachment of the annulus to the tympanic bone. In the gerbil, smooth muscle seems to be concentrated in the central part of the width of the annulus where it is attached to bone and radiates toward the tympanic membrane. In humans collections of radially oriented smooth muscle cells were found in several locations. The smooth muscle in all species studied appears to form a rim of contractile elements for the pars tensa.

208,17161538.0,Increased muscle pain sensitivity in patients with tension-type headache.,Pain,"Nociceptive mechanisms in tension-type headache are poorly understood. The aim was to investigate the pain sensitivity of pericranial muscles and a limb muscle in patients with tension-type headache. Experimental muscle pain was induced by standardized infusions of 0.5 ml of 1 M hypertonic saline into two craniofacial muscles (anterior temporalis (TPA) and masseter (MAS)) and a limb muscle (anterior tibial (TA)) in 24 frequent episodic tension-type headache patients (FETTH), 22 chronic tension-type headache patients (CTTH) and 26 age and gender matched healthy subjects. Headache patients were examined twice, both on days with and on days without headache. The pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were determined before and after infusions. The subjects continuously reported intensity of saline-induced pain on an electronic visual analogue scale (VAS) and the perceived area of pain was drawn on anatomical maps. Headache patients demonstrated significantly lower PPTs, higher saline-evoked VAS pain scores and greater pain areas than healthy subjects at all the tested muscle sites (P<0.05). There was a significant gender difference for the PPTs in all three groups of participants (P<0.05) and for VAS pain scores in the CTTH patients (P<0.05). There was no difference in pain sensitivity between FETTH and CTTH or between patients with or without headache. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the presence of generalized pain hypersensitivity both in FETTH and CTTH compared to controls which is unrelated to actual headache status and extends to include responses to longer-lasting stimuli which are clinically highly relevant. Gender differences in deep pain sensitivity seem to be a consistent finding both in healthy controls and patients with tension-type headache.",2007,129,2-Jan,113-21,10.1016/j.pain.2006.09.037,#2873,Schmidt-Hansen 2007,

We investigated the effects of resistance training (RT) and protein supplementation on muscle mass, strength, and fiber characteristics of the LDM. Eighteen healthy young subjects were randomly assigned to a progressive eight-week RT program with a normal protein diet (NP) or high protein diet (HP) (NP 0.85 vs. HP 1.8 g of protein·kg(-1)·day(-1)). One repetition maximum tests, magnetic resonance imaging for cross-sectional muscle area (CSA), body composition, and single muscle fibers mechanical and phenotype characteristics were measured. RT induced a significant gain in strength (+17%, p < 0.0001), whole muscle CSA (p = 0.024), and single muscle fibers CSA (p < 0.05) of LDM in all subjects. Fiber isometric force increased in proportion to CSA (+22%, p < 0.005) and thus no change in specific tension occurred. A significant transition from 2X to 2A myosin expression was induced by training. The protein supplementation showed no significant effects on all measured outcomes except for a smaller reduction of 2X myosin expression. Our results suggest that in LDM protein supplementation does not further enhance RT-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy nor influence mechanic muscle fiber characteristics but partially counteracts the fast-to-slow fiber shift.",2016,8,6,,10.3390/nu8060331,#2874,Paoli 2016,myosin isoform
210,29198368.0,Trunk musculoskeletal response in maximum voluntary exertions: A combined measurement-modeling investigation.,J Biomech,"Maximum voluntary exertion (MVE) tasks quantify trunk strength and maximal muscle electromyography (EMG) activities with both clinical and biomechanical implications. The aims here are to evaluate the performance of an existing trunk musculoskeletal model, estimate maximum muscle stresses and spinal forces, and explore likely differences between males and females in maximum voluntary exertions. We, therefore, measured trunk strength and EMG activities of 19 healthy right-handed subjects (9 females and 10 males) in flexion, extension, lateral and axial directions. MVEs for all subjects were then simulated in a subject-specific trunk musculoskeletal model, and estimated muscle activities were compared with EMGs. Analysis of variance was used to compare measured moments and estimated spinal loads at the L5-S1 level between females and males. MVE moments in both sexes were greatest in extension (means of 236 Nm in males and 190 Nm in females) and least in left axial torque (97 Nm in males and 64 Nm in females). Being much greater in lateral and axial MVEs, coupled moments reached ∼50% of primary moments in average. Females exerted less moments in all directions reaching significance except in flexion. Muscle activity estimations were strongly correlated with measurements in flexion and extension (Pearson's r = 0.69 and 0.76), but the correlations were very weak in lateral and axial MVEs (Pearson's r = 0.27 and 0.13). Maximum muscle stress was in average 0.80 ± 0.42 MPa but varied among muscles from 0.40 ± 0.22  MPa in rectus abdominis to 0.99 ± 0.29 MPa in external oblique. To estimate maximum muscle stresses and evaluate validity of a musculoskeletal model, MVEs in all directions with all coupled moments should be considered.",2018,70,,124-133,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2017.11.007,#2875,Ghezelbash 2018,Dynamometer
211,21697543.0,Large-conductance voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ channels regulate human detrusor smooth muscle function.,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,"The large-conductance voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channel is expressed in many smooth muscle types, but its role in human detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) is unclear. With a multidisciplinary approach spanning channel molecules, single-channel activity, freshly isolated human DSM cells, intact DSM preparations, and the BK channel specific inhibitor iberiotoxin, we elucidated human DSM BK channel function and regulation. Native human DSM tissues were obtained during open surgeries from patients with no preoperative history of overactive bladder. RT-PCR experiments on single human DSM cells showed mRNA expression of BK channel α-, β(1)-, and β(4)-subunits. Western blot and immunocytochemistry confirmed BK channel α, β(1), and β(4) protein expression. Native human BK channel properties were described using the perforated whole cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. In freshly isolated human DSM cells, BK channel blockade with iberiotoxin inhibited a significant portion of the total voltage step-induced whole cell K(+) current. From single BK channel recordings, human BK channel conductance was calculated to be 136 pS. Voltage-dependent iberiotoxin- and ryanodine-sensitive transient BK currents were identified in human DSM cells. In current-clamp mode, iberiotoxin inhibited the hyperpolarizing membrane potential transients and depolarized the cell resting membrane potential. Isometric DSM tension recordings revealed that BK channels principally control the contractions of isolated human DSM strips. Collectively, our results indicate that BK channels are fundamental regulators of DSM excitability and contractility and may represent new targets for pharmacological or genetic control of urinary bladder function in humans.",2011,301,4,C903-12,10.1152/ajpcell.00495.2010,#2876,Hristov 2011,

This prospective study examined the neck muscle tension of 16 participants before and after a single session of voice therapy. Interrater reliability and relationships between palpation ratings and objective measures of sEMG (anterior neck) and the third formant for /a/ were assessed using Pearson's correlations (r). Interrater reliability was relatively low as measured by Pearson's correlations, although Wilcoxon signed-rank test results were similar as those in a previous study. Correlations between palpation ratings and sEMG and between ratings of laryngeal height and the third formant for /a/ were generally low. Correlations increased between anterior neck sEMG and ratings of suprahyoid muscle tension when examined in a reduced set of individuals with higher interrater reliability. Palpation rating scales do not reliably capture changes that may occur in neck muscle tension of typical voice therapy patients over one session. Consequently, little can be concluded from correlations between sEMG and palpation ratings.",2011,25,1,67-75,10.1016/j.jvoice.2009.08.001,#2877,Stepp 2011,
213,21401398.0,Vardenafil effect on ureteric smooth muscle: in vitro study in porcine model.,J Endourol,"INTRODUCTION: Phosphodiesrase type 5 inhibitors have been recently reported to induce a relaxing effect on ureteral smooth muscle. We conducted an in vitro study to elucidate the relaxing effect of various doses of vardenafil on the porcine ureter. Moreover, we propose a porcine ureter model for the evaluation of the effect of different substances on the ureter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total number of 24 ureters were obtained by domestic pigs. The obtained ureteral specimens were immediately placed in Krebs solution. All specimens were cut into 4- to 5-mm-long tubular segments, which were mounted in 10 mL vertical chambers of an organ bath system. The same specific conditions were set to the organ bath device for all specimens. The tubular segments were connected to a force/pressure transducer device. After automatic ureteral contractions with stable frequency were achieved, different doses of vardenafil (0.1, 1, and 10 μM) were added to the bath chambers. Isometric responses of the tissues throughout the experiment were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The administration of vardenafil resulted in reduction of both rate and tension of the ureteral contraction regardless of the dose of vardenafil. Nevertheless, statistical analysis revealed significantly reduced ureteral contraction rate and tension when vardenafil 1 or 10 μM was administered in comparison to the initial steady state. CONCLUSION: Vardenafil concentrations of 1 and 10 μM should be considered as appropriate for ureteral relaxation. The porcine model replicates human ureteral response in vitro at least in the case of phosphodiesrase type 5 inhibitors and probably would be useful for the evaluation of other pharmaceutical agents.",2011,25,3,505-9,10.1089/end.2010.0244,#2879,Al-Aown 2011,

Thirty-six females with fibromyalgia performed isokinetic maximal forward flexions of the shoulder combined with surface EMG recordings of the trapezius and infraspinatus muscles. Signal amplitude ratio and peak torque were calculated in the initial and endurance test phases. Pain intensity, perceived general and local shoulder muscle tension, and personality traits using the Karolinska Scales of Personality were assessed pre-test. Neither perceived muscle tension nor muscular tension personality trait correlated with EMG muscle hyperactivity. Perceived general muscle tension correlated with aspects of anxiety proneness (including muscle tension) of the Karolinska Scales of Personality. Pain intensity interacted with many of the variables. We propose that when patients with fibromyalgia report muscle tension that they may be expressing something other than physiological muscle tension.",2002,34,2,73-9,10.1080/165019702753557863,#2880,Kendall 2002,
215,23307183.0,How specific are risk factors for headache in adolescents? Results from a cross-sectional study in Germany.,Neuropediatrics,"BACKGROUND: The identified preventable risk factors for primary headache in adolescents are smoking; consumption of coffee or alcoholic mixed drinks; physical inactivity; muscle pain in the head, neck, or shoulder region; and chronic stress. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interrelation of headache with other health complaints and the specificity of the above-mentioned risk factors for headache in adolescents. METHODS: A total of 1,260 students (grades 10 and 11) filled in questionnaires on headache, dietary, and lifestyle factors. The type of headache and health complaints such as dizziness, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pains, symptoms of possible fatigue syndrome, and psychic complaints were assessed. RESULTS: Isolated headache was found in 18% of the headache sufferers; most frequently isolated tension-type headache (78.2%). Only among adolescents with a combination of headache (mainly migraine) and other health complaints, significant associations for almost all analyzed risk factors were found. The strength of the associations with the considered risk factors was very similar in all three analyzed strata except for considerably lower odds ratios for isolated headache. CONCLUSION: All analyzed risk factors are nonspecific for headache in adolescents because they also increase the risk for other health complaints. Interventions, therefore, should consider a holistic approach focusing not only on headache but also on a broader spectrum of health complaints.",2013,44,1,46-54,10.1055/s-0032-1333432,#2881,Lehmann 2013,
216,17359516.0,Myofascial trigger points and sensitization: an updated pain model for tension-type headache.,Cephalalgia,"Present pain models for tension-type headache suggest that nociceptive inputs from peripheral tender muscles can lead to central sensitization and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) conditions. Such models support that possible peripheral mechanisms leading to pericranial tenderness include activation or sensitization of nociceptive nerve endings by liberation of chemical mediators (bradikinin, serotonin, substance P). However, a study has found that non-specific tender points in CTTH subjects were not responsible for liberation of algogenic substances in the periphery. Assuming that liberation of algogenic substances is important, the question arising is: if tender muscle points are not the primary sites of on-going neurogenic inflammation, which structure can be responsible for liberation of chemical mediators in the periphery? A recent study has found higher levels of algogenic substances, and lower pH levels, in active myofascial trigger point (TrPs) compared with control tender points. Clinical studies have demonstrated that referred pain elicited by head and neck muscles contribute to head pain patterns in CTTH. Based on available data, an updated pain model for CTTH is proposed in which headache can at least partly be explained by referred pain from TrPs in the posterior cervical, head and shoulder muscles. In this updated pain model, TrPs would be the primary hyperalgesic zones responsible for the development of central sensitization in CTTH.",2007,27,5,383-93,10.1111/j.1468-2982.2007.01295.x,#2883,FernÃ¡ndez-de-las-PeÃ±as 2007,
217,21778095.0,Efficacy of the intraoperative relaxed muscle positioning technique in thyroid eye disease and analysis of cases requiring reoperation.,J AAPOS,"PURPOSE: In the relaxed muscle positioning technique of treating strabismus for thyroid eye disease (TED), the most restricted muscles, as determined by preoperative assessment of ductions and intraoperative forced ductions, are recessed to the positions where they rest freely on the globe without tension. The purpose of this technique is to identify preoperative characteristics that are predictive of reoperation and evaluate outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with TED who underwent strabismus surgery using the relaxed muscle positioning technique between 1999 and 2009. Preoperative characteristics; surgical outcomes at 2, 6, and 12 months; and the outcomes of reoperations were evaluated. Outcomes were categorized as excellent (no diplopia in primary and reading gazes without prisms), good (diplopia requiring ≤10(Δ) correction), and poor (persistent diplopia in primary or reading gazes despite prism or attempted prism correction). RESULTS: Of 63 TED patients treated during the study period, 58 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 45 patients (78%) underwent only one strabismus surgery; 10 (17%), 2 surgeries; and 3 (5%), 3. Excellent outcomes were achieved in 48 (83%), good in 4 (7%), and poor in 6 (10%). Mean follow-up was 12.1 months (range, 1.5 months to 11.5 years). There was an increased likelihood for reoperation in patients with multiple treatment modalities for Graves disease (P = 0.03) and larger horizontal deviations (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The intraoperative relaxed muscle positioning technique improved ocular alignment and relieved diplopia in most patients with dysthyroid strabismus. Patients with more severe disease were more likely to require reoperation.",2011,15,4,321-5,10.1016/j.jaapos.2011.03.014,#2884,Nicholson 2011,
218,33853835.0,A 4-year study of hamstring injury outcomes in elite track and field using the British Athletics rehabilitation approach.,Br J Sports Med,"OBJECTIVES: The British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification (BAMIC) correlates with return to play in muscle injury. The aim of this study was to examine hamstring injury diagnoses and outcomes within elite track and field athletes following implementation of the British Athletics hamstring rehabilitation approach. METHODS: All hamstring injuries sustained by elite track and field athletes on the British Athletics World Class Programme between December 2015 and November 2019 that underwent an MRI and had British Athletics medical team prescribed rehabilitation were included. Athlete demographics and specific injury details, including mechanism of injury, self-reported gait phase, MRI characteristics and time to return to full training (TRFT) were contemporaneously recorded. RESULTS: 70 hamstring injuries in 46 athletes (24 women and 22 men, 24.6±3.7 years) were included. BAMIC grade and the intratendon c classification correlated with increased TRFT. Mean TRFT was 18.6 days for the entire cohort. Mean TRFT for intratendon classifications was 34±7 days (2c) and 48±17 days (3c). The overall reinjury rate was 2.9% and no reinjuries were sustained in the intratendon classifications. MRI variables of length and cross-sectional (CSA) area of muscle oedema, CSA of tendon injury and loss of tendon tension were associated with TRFT. Longitudinal length of tendon injury, in the intratendon classes, was not associated with TRFT. CONCLUSION: The application of BAMIC to inform hamstring rehabilitation in British Athletics results in low reinjury rates and favourable TRFT following hamstring injury. The key MRI variables associated with longer recovery are length and CSA of muscle oedema, CSA of tendon injury and loss of tendon tension.",2022,56,5,257-263,10.1136/bjsports-2020-103791,#2885,Pollock 2022,elite performance
219,10903163.0,Early specialization of the superfast myosin in extraocular and laryngeal muscles.,J Exp Biol,"Extraocular muscle (EOM) exhibits high-velocity, low-tension contractions compared with other vertebrate striated muscles. These distinctive properties have been associated with a novel myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform, MyHC-EO. An atypical MyHC, MyHC IIL, has also been identified in laryngeal muscles that have similarly fast contractile properties. It co-migrates with MyHC-EO on high-resolution SDS gels, but appeared to be encoded by a different mRNA. We combined CNBr peptide maps and full-length cDNA sequences to show that rabbit muscle EO and IIL MyHCs are identical. Analysis of the 5; untranslated region (5;UTR) of the mRNAs identified three variants that result from a combination of alternative splicing and multiple transcription initiation sites. This complex pattern of 5;UTRs has not been reported previously for MyHC genes. We identified the human homologue of the MyHC-EO gene in GenBank, and analyzed the 5; upstream region, which revealed a paucity of muscle-specific transcription factor binding sites compared with the other MyHC genes. These features are likely to be critical to the unique regulation and tissue-specific expression of the MyHC-EO/IIL gene. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that MyHC-EO/IIL diverged from an ancestral MyHC gene to generate the first specialized fast myosin. The catalytic S1 head domain is more closely related to the fast MyHCs, while the rod is more closely related to the slow/cardiac MyHCs. The exon boundaries of the MyHC-EO are identical to those of the embryonic MyHC gene and virtually identical to those of the &agr; and (&bgr;) cardiac genes. This implies that most of the current exon boundaries were present in the ancestral gene, predating the duplications that generated the family of skeletal and cardiac myosin genes.",2000,203,Pt 16,2485-94,10.1242/jeb.203.16.2485,#2886,Briggs 2000,

Various massage systems have been developed, but their motions are not uniform throughout different body parts nor specifically targeted to the neck and shoulder areas. OBJECTIVE: Pressure pattern and finger movement trajectories of the circular friction hand massage on trapezius, levator scapulae, and deltoid muscles were determined to develop a massage system that can mimic the motion and the pressure of the circular friction massage. METHODS: During the massage, finger movement trajectories were measured using a 3D motion capture system, and finger pressures were simultaneously obtained using a grip pressure sensor. RESULTS: Results showed that each muscle had different finger movement trajectory and pressure pattern. The trapezius muscle experienced a higher pressure, longer massage time (duration of pressurization), and larger pressure-time integral than the other muscles.

Techniques for the clinical assessment of these reflexes are emerging and need to be examined for sensitivity and specificity in identifying laryngeal sensory disorders.

222,20827211.0,In-vitro contracture testing for susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia: can halothane be replaced?,Eur J Anaesthesiol,"BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia is a potentially lethal inherited hypermetabolic syndrome that develops in susceptible individuals following administration of depolarising neuromuscular relaxants or volatile anaesthetics. Genetic analysis can only confirm a diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia in about 70%, and in the remainder an in-vitro contracture test, with halothane and caffeine, on muscle obtained from open muscle biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis. As the licence for clinical use of halothane expired in 2005, its continuing availability is in doubt. More modern volatile anaesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane are less potent triggers of malignant hyperthermia in humans and pigs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these agents can be considered possible substitutes for halothane in a modified in-vitro contracture test. METHOD: With institutional review board approval and prior written consent, muscle bundles of 30 patients with a personal or family history of malignant hyperthermia were investigated. Of these, 13 were diagnosed malignant hyperthermia susceptible and 17 nonsusceptible. Surplus muscle was tested with increasing concentrations of enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane. RESULTS: There were no differences in weight, length or predrug tension of the muscle bundles. At increasing concentration, all volatile anaesthetics except sevoflurane induced significantly greater contractures in malignant hyperthermia susceptible compared to malignant hyperthermia nonsusceptible muscle. In malignant hyperthermia susceptible muscle bundles, halothane led to significantly higher contractures compared to the other investigated substances. CONCLUSION: Halothane was the strongest discriminator for malignant hyperthermia in the in-vitro contracture tests. It remains the ideal substance for diagnostic testing and cannot simply be replaced by other agents in this test.",2011,28,4,251-5,10.1097/EJA.0b013e32833ed06c,#2889,Metterlein 2011,
223,11005719.0,"Characterisation of human soft palate muscles with respect to fibre types, myosins and capillary supply.",J Anat,"Four human soft palate muscles, and palatopharyngeus, the uvula, the levator and tensor veli palatini were examined using enzyme-histochemical, immunohistochemical and biochemical methods and compared with human limb and facial muscles. Our results showed that each palate muscle had a distinct morphological identity and that they generally shared more similarities with facial than limb muscles. The palatopharyngeus and uvula muscles contained 2 of the highest proportions of type II fibres ever reported for human muscles. In contrast, the levator and tensor veli palatini muscles contained predominantly type I fibres. A fetal myosin heavy chain isoform (MyHC), not usually found in normal adult limb muscles, was present in a small number of fibres in all palate muscles. The mean muscle fibre diameter was smaller than in limb muscles and the individual and intramuscular variability in diameter and shape was considerable. All palate muscles had a high capillary density and an unusually high mitochondrial enzyme activity in the type II fibres, in comparison with limb muscles. No ordinary muscle spindles were observed. The fibre type and MyHC composition indicate that the palatopharyngeus and uvula muscles are functionally involved in quick movements whereas the levator and tensor veli palatini muscles perform slower and more continuous contractions. The high aerobic capacity and the rich capillarisation suggest that the palate muscles are relatively fatigue resistant. Absence of ordinary muscle spindles indicates a special proprioceptive control system. The special morphology of the palate muscles may be partly related to the unique anatomy with only one skeletal insertion, a feature consistent with muscle work at low load and tension and which may influence the cytoarchitecture of these muscles. Other important factors determining the special morphological characteristics might be specific functional requirements, distinct embryological origin and phylogenetic factors.",2000,197 ( Pt 2),Pt 2,275-90,10.1046/j.1469-7580.2000.19720275.x,#2891,StÃ¥l 2000,

Ratings of perceived tension, pain, and aversiveness as well as EMG, heart rate, and skin conductance levels were recorded. Signal detection and correlational methods revealed that the patients were deficient in muscle tension discrimination at high tension levels in both muscles. They generally overestimated low and underestimated high levels of muscle tension, especially in the CBP group. At low muscle tension levels, both healthy controls and patients showed deficient discrimination ability. Perceived muscle tension, aversiveness, and pain ratings during the tasks were higher in the patient groups. These data confirm and clarify previous reports of deficient tension perception and show concurrent overestimation of bodily symptoms in chronic musculoskeletal pain patients.",1999,24,1,55-66,10.1023/a:1022847131149,#2892,Flor 1999,

Numerous septa detach from its internal surface, creating an intimate connection between the fascia and the pectoralis major muscle. DISCUSSION: The pectoral fascia and the pectoralis major muscle should be considered together, given that the anatomical base is effectively a myofascial unit, term that defines the muscles and the fascia of a specific region that have a precise functional organization. The capacity of force transmission between the inferior and superior limbs needs to be attributed to this entire myofascial complex.

Twenty-nine consecutive patients with rectal cancer were included. The treatment simulation of the lateral beam in prone position was performed twice-with relaxed and next with maximally tense pelvic muscles. During the second simulation, the couch was moved so as to align the centre of the beam with the actual position of the skin mark tattooed during the first simulation. The bony landmarks on both images of corresponding lateral fields were matched. The beam's centre displacement and the rotation were measured using the beam image taken in relaxed position as a reference. The absolute values were used in calculation of the mean. For the anterior-posterior direction, the mean value of displacements was 15.3 mm, standard deviation (SD) 6.9 mm and the maximal value 37 mm. For the cranial-caudal direction, the mean value was 4.4 mm, SD 4 mm and the maximal value 17 mm. The mean rotation of the pelvis was 5.3 degrees, SD 2.4 degrees and maximal rotation 11 degrees. The majority of displacements were in the posterior (86%) and caudal (55%) directions. The majority of rotations were clockwise (76%). It was shown that pelvic muscle tension was the reason for anal verge displacements and mispositionings of the shielding block. This results in set-up inaccuracy, especially in the anterior-posterior direction, shielding block mispositioning and anal verge displacement.",2004,43,8,740-3,10.1080/02841860512331336635,#2894,Bujko 2004,

Analysis of the Visible Human data was utilised in order to obtain anatomical information unavailable from the literature and magnetic resonance imaging was used to generate subject-specific anatomical descriptions. The model was evaluated by comparisons with measured maximal voluntary static back-extension torques. Predicted maximal specific muscle tensions agreed well with in vitro measurements from the literature. When modelling the maximal static back-extension torque production, it was possible to come fairly close to simultaneous equilibrium about all the lumbar discs simply by a uniform muscle activation of all back-extensor muscles (the caudal part showed, however, less agreement). This indicates that equilibrium in the lumbar spine is mainly regulated by passive mechanical properties, e.g. muscle length changes due to postural changes, rather than due to complex muscle coordination, as earlier proposed. The model showed that IAP (measured during torque exertions) contributes about 10% of the total maximal voluntary back-extensor torque and that it can unload the spine from compression. The spinal unloading effect from the IAP was greatest with the spine held in a flexed position. This is in opposition to the effects of changed muscle lever arm lengths, which for a given load would give the largest spinal unloading in the extended position. These findings have implications for the evaluation of optimal lifting techniques.",2003,36,6,815-25,10.1016/s0021-9290(03)00015-0,#2895,Daggfeldt 2003,

To determine whether overexpression of SLN in the heart might impair cardiac function, transgenic (TG) mice were generated with cardiac-specific overexpression of NF-SLN (SLN tagged at its N terminus with the FLAG epitope). The level of NF-SLN expression (the NF-SLN/PLN expression ratio) was equivalent to that which induces profound superinhibition when coexpressed with PLN and SERCA2a in HEK-293 cells. In TG hearts, the apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca(2+) was decreased compared with non-TG littermate control hearts. Invasive hemodynamic and echocardiographic analyses revealed impaired cardiac contractility and ventricular hypertrophy in TG mice. Basal PLN phosphorylation was reduced. In isolated papillary muscle subjected to isometric tension, peak amplitudes of Ca(2+) transients and peak tensions were reduced, whereas decay times of Ca(2+) transients and relaxation times of tension were increased in TG mice. Isoproterenol largely restored contractility in papillary muscle and stimulated PLN phosphorylation to wild-type levels in intact hearts. No compensatory changes in expression of SERCA2a, PLN, ryanodine receptor, and calsequestrin were observed in TG hearts. Coimmunoprecipitation indicated that overexpressed NF-SLN was bound to both SERCA2a and PLN, forming a ternary complex. These data suggest that NF-SLN overexpression inhibits SERCA2a through stabilization of SERCA2a-PLN interaction in the absence of PLN phosphorylation and through the inhibition of PLN phosphorylation. Inhibition of SERCA2a impairs contractility and calcium cycling, but responsiveness to beta-adrenergic agonists may prevent progression to heart failure.",2004,101,25,9199-204,10.1073/pnas.0402596101,#2896,Asahi 2004,
229,29633518.0,Water deprivation decreases strength in fast twitch muscle in contrast to slow twitch muscle in rat.,Acta Physiol (Oxf),"AIM: The effects of dehydration on muscle performance in human are still contradictory, notably regarding muscle force. The effect of water deprivation (WD) on mechanical properties of skeletal muscle, and more precisely its impact on slow and fast muscles, remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine for the first time whether WD leads to changes in contractile properties of skeletal muscle and whether these changes were muscle-type-specific. METHODS: Sixteen-week-old male rats were assigned to either a control group (C) with water or a 96-hour WD group. At the end of the period, twitch and tetanus properties, as well as biochemical and structural analysis, were performed on soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles. RESULTS: Absolute twitch (Pt) and tetanic (P(0) ) tension were, respectively, 17% and 14% lower in EDL of WD rats as compared with C rats, whereas unexpected increases of 43% and 25% were observed in SOL. Tensions normalized with respect to muscle mass were not affected by WD in EDL, whereas they were increased by more than 40% in SOL. A 96-hour WD period leads to a decrease in fibre cross-sectional area and absolute myofibrillar content only in EDL. CONCLUSION: It is hypothesized that differences in the results between slow and fast muscles may come from (i) a muscle-type-specific effect of WD on protein balance, EDL showing a greater myofibrillar protein breakdown and (ii) a greater sensitivity to osmolality changes induced by WD in EDL than in SOL.",2018,224,1,e13072,10.1111/apha.13072,#2897,Farhat 2018,aquaporin-4
230,19118793.0,Anatomical study of myofascial continuity in the anterior region of the upper limb.,J Bodyw Mov Ther,"Fifteen unembalmed cadavers were dissected in order to study the ""anatomical continuity"" between the various muscles involved in the movement of flexion of the upper limb. This study demonstrated the existence of specific myofascial expansions, with a nearly constant pattern, which originate from the flexor muscles and extend to the overlying fascia. The clavicular part of the pectoralis major sends a myofascial expansion, with a mean length of 3.6cm, to the anterior region of the brachial fascia, and the costal part sends one to the medial region of the brachial fascia (mean length: 6.8cm). The biceps brachii presents two expansions: the lacertus fibrosus, oriented medially, with a mean height of 4.7cm and a base of 1.9cm, and a second, less evident, longitudinal expansion (mean length: 4.5cm, mean width: 0.7cm). Lastly, the palmaris longus sends an expansion to the fascia overlying the thenar muscles (mean length: 1.6cm, mean width: 0.5cm). During flexion, as these muscles contract, the anterior portion of the brachial and antebrachial fascia is subject to tension. As the fascia is rich in proprioceptive nerve endings, it is hypothesized that this tension activates a specific pattern of receptors, contributing to perception of motor direction. If the muscular fascia is in a non-physiological state, these mechanisms are altered, and the proprioceptors in the fascia may be incorrectly activated, thus giving rise to many types of extra-articular pain.",2009,13,1,53-62,10.1016/j.jbmt.2007.04.009,#2898,Stecco 2009,

The increase in maximal voluntary strength (+12%) was accompanied by neural (cross-education effect and increased muscle activation) and muscle adaptations (impairment of whole-muscle contractile properties). Significant changes in myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms relative content (+22% for MHC-2A and -28% for MHC-2X), single-fiber cross-sectional area (+27% for type 1 and +6% for type 2A muscle fibers), and specific tension of type 1 (+67%) but not type 2A fibers were also observed after training. Plastic changes in neural control confirm the possible involvement of both spinal and supraspinal structures to electrically evoked contractions. Changes at the single muscle fiber level induced by electrostimulation resistance training were significant and preferentially affected slow, type 1 fibers.",2006,85,2,167-75,10.1097/01.phm.0000197570.03343.18,#2900,Maffiuletti 2006,
232,21903445.0,"The relationships between measures of stature recovery, muscle activity and psychological factors in patients with chronic low back pain.",Man Ther,"Individuals with low back pain (LBP) often exhibit elevated paraspinal muscle activity compared to asymptomatic controls during static postures such as standing. This hyperactivity has been associated with a delayed rate of stature recovery in individuals with mild LBP. This study aimed to explore this association further in a more clinically relevant population of NHS patients with LBP and to investigate if relationships exist with a number of psychological factors. Forty seven patients were recruited from waiting lists for physiotherapist-led rehabilitation programmes. Paraspinal muscle activity while standing was assessed via surface electromyogram (EMG) and stature recovery over a 40-min unloading period was measured on a precision stadiometer. Self-report of pain, disability, anxiety, depression, pain-related anxiety, fear of movement, self-efficacy and catastrophising were recorded. Correlations were found between muscle activity and both pain (r=0.48) and disability (r=0.43). Muscle activity was also correlated with self-efficacy (r=-0.45), depression (r=0.33), anxiety (r=0.31), pain-related anxiety (r=0.29) and catastrophising (r=0.29) and was a mediator between self-efficacy and pain. Pain was a mediator in the relationship between muscle activity and disability. Stature recovery was not found to be related to pain, disability, muscle activity or any of the psychological factors. The findings confirm the importance of muscle activity within LBP, in particular as a pathway by which psychological factors may impact on clinical outcome. The mediating role of muscle activity between psychological factors and pain suggests that interventions that are able to reduce muscle tension may be of particular benefit to patients demonstrating such characteristics, which may help in the targeting of treatment for LBP.",2012,17,1,27-33,10.1016/j.math.2011.08.001,#2901,Lewis 2012,

A literature search identified 74 outcome studies, of which 53 were selected according to predefined inclusion criteria. Meta-analytic integration resulted in a significant medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.73; 95% confidence interval = 0.61, 0.84) that proved stable over an average follow-up phase of 15 months. Biofeedback was more effective than headache monitoring, placebo, and relaxation therapies. The strongest improvements resulted for frequency of headache episodes. Further significant effects were observed for muscle tension, self-efficacy, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and analgesic medication. Moderator analyses revealed biofeedback in combination with relaxation to be the most effective treatment modality; effects were particularly large in children and adolescents. In intention-to-treat and publication-bias analyses, the consistency of these findings was demonstrated. It is concluded that biofeedback constitutes an evidence-based treatment option for tension-type headache.",2008,76,3,379-96,10.1037/0022-006X.76.3.379,#2902,Nestoriuc 2008,
234,28854396.0,Effect of resistance training on headache symptoms in adults: Secondary analysis of a RCT.,Musculoskelet Sci Pract,"BACKGROUND: While strength training for the neck and shoulder muscles may be effective in reducing headache, the optimal combination of exercise frequency and duration is unknown. This study investigates the effect of different time-wise combinations of one weekly hour of strength training for the neck and shoulder muscles on headache frequency, intensity, and use of analgesics. METHODS: A total of 573 office workers were randomly allocated at the cluster-level to five groups; 3 × 20 min a week of minimally supervised (3MS), 1 × 60 (1WS), 3 × 20 (3WS) or 9 × 7 (9WS) min a week of supervised high-intensity strength training for 20 weeks, or to a reference group without training (REF). Headache frequency, intensity, and use of analgesics in relation to headache were determined by questionnaire at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis showed reduced headache frequency and intensity of approximately 50% in all training groups compared with REF at 20-week follow-up (P < 0.001). Use of analgesics was lower in the supervised training groups (1WS, 3WS and 9WS), but not in the group with minimal training supervision (3MS), compared with REF at follow-up. CONCLUSION: One hour of specific strength training - regardless of the distribution during the week - effectively reduced both headache frequency and intensity in office workers. Thus, a large time-wise flexibility exists when implementing specific strength training at the workplace. However, only supervised training led to a reduction in use of analgesics for headache.",2017,32,,38-43,10.1016/j.msksp.2017.08.003,#2903,Andersen 2017,Neck pain
235,9151937.0,Heterogeneity of the inhibitory influence of sulfonylureas on prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction.,Eur J Pharmacol,"In addition to their hypoglycemic influence, sulfonylureas have been reported to inhibit prostanoid-induced vasoconstriction. Using isometric tension measurements we investigated whether this inhibitory influence is exerted by different sulfonylureas in various types of blood vessels from different species and in other types of smooth muscle cells. It was found that in addition to glibenclamide and tolbutamide also gliclazide (1 mM) and tolazamide (1 mM) block contractions induced by prostaglandin F2alpha and the thromboxane A2 mimetic U-46619 in rat aorta, but not the contractions elicited by norepinephrine, serotonin or high potassium. Glibenclamide (10 microM) inhibits the prostaglandin F2alpha- and U-46619-induced contractions on rat tail, femoral and renal interlobar arteries and on bovine retinal and ciliary arteries, but not those on aorta and carotid artery from guinea pigs and on human subcutaneous arteries. Glibenclamide (10 microM), tolbutamide (1 mM), tolazamide (1 mM) and gliclazide (1 mM) all block contractions induced by U-46619, but not those induced by carbachol, on rat intrapulmonary bronchioles. However, prostanoid-induced contractions of guinea-pig trachea and main bronchi are not influenced by glibenclamide (10 microM). From these results it is concluded that the ability of sulfonylureas to block prostanoid-induced contractions is shared by all sulfonylureas tested, that this is not limited to vascular smooth muscle cells and that it shows a heterogeneity, that might be linked to interspecies differences.",1997,325,1,41-6,10.1016/s0014-2999(97)00097-6,#2904,Delaey 1997,

METHODS: Ten women with MTD and fifteen healthy women participated in this study. The fMRI experiment was carried out using a block design paradigm. Brain activation during phonation and exhalation was analyzed using BrainVoyager software. RESULTS: The statistical analysis of fMRI data has demonstrated that MTD patients control phonation by use of the auditory, motor, frontal, parietal, and subcortical areas similar to phonation control by healthy people. Comparison of phonation tasks in the two groups revealed higher brain activities in the precentral gyrus, inferior, middle and superior frontal gyrus, lingual gyrus, insula, cerebellum, midbrain, and brainstem as well as lower brain activities in the cingulate gyrus, superior and middle temporal gyrus, and inferior parietal lobe in the MTD group. No differences were found between the two groups regarding exhalation control. CONCLUSIONS: The findings in this study provide insight into phonation and exhalation control in patients with MTD. The imaging results demonstrated that in patients with MTD, altered (higher/lower) brain activities may result in laryngeal tension and vocal hyperfunction.",2017,31,6,675-690,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.03.010,#2905,Kryshtopava 2017,Exhalation control
237,20697736.0,Changes in contractile properties of skinned single rat soleus and diaphragm fibres after chronic hypoxia.,Pflugers Arch,"Hypoxia may be one of the factors underlying muscle dysfunction during ageing and chronic lung and heart failure. Here we tested the hypothesis that chronic hypoxia per se affects contractile properties of single fibres of the soleus and diaphragm muscle. To do this, the force-velocity relationship, rate of force redevelopment and calcium sensitivity of single skinned fibres from normoxic rats and rats exposed to 4 weeks of hypobaric hypoxia (410 mmHg) were investigated. The reduction in maximal force (P(0)) after hypoxia (p=0.031) was more pronounced in type IIa than type I fibres and was mainly attributable to a reduction in fibre cross-sectional area (p=0.044). In type IIa fibres this was aggravated by a reduction in specific tension (p=0.001). The maximal velocity of shortening (V (max)) and shape of the force velocity relation (a/P(0)), however, did not differ between normoxic and hypoxic muscle fibres and the reduction in maximal power of hypoxic fibres (p=0.012) was mainly due to a reduction in P(0). In conclusion, chronic hypoxia causes muscle fibre dysfunction which is not only due to a loss of muscle mass, but also to a diminished force generating capacity of the remaining contractile material. These effects are similar in the soleus and diaphragm muscle, but more pronounced in type IIa than I fibres.",2010,460,5,863-73,10.1007/s00424-010-0866-5,#2906,Degens 2010,
238,33601108.0,Wrapping technique and wrapping height interact to modify physical exposures during manual pallet wrapping.,Appl Ergon,"Occupational tasks often involve musculoskeletal demands that contribute to injury risk. In pallet wrapping tasks, 36% of workplace claims involve over exertion and repetitive exposures (Workplace Safety and Prevention Services, 2012). Tools that modify how the wrap is handled by workers have been introduced to help mitigate over exertion and extreme postures wherever possible. A novel device has been introduced that places the required tension on the roll to mitigate these factors. However, the effect of reducing the necessary tension on the roll during pallet wrapping in limiting muscular demand and extreme postures is unknown. Fourteen healthy university aged participants completed 12 wrapping trials on a simulated pallet (2 repetitions of 2 wrapping techniques (device, hand wrapping) at 3 wrapping heights (low, medium, high)). Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on 6 shoulder and 2 low back muscles; anterior and middle deltoids, biceps brachii, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, upper trapezius, and erector spinae (T8 & L3). Kinematic data were collected for the torso and upper extremity and global to torso, and torso to upper arm angles were computed. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for the following experimental factors: 1) technique used (device or hand wrapping) and 2) the wrapping height (low, medium, high) for each muscle (8), angle (5), rating of perceived discomfort (1) and rating of perceived exertion (1). Pallet wrapping without a device required greater trunk flexion at lower heights and thoracohumeral elevation at higher wrapping heights as compared to using the device. Muscular activation increased when using the device, specifically at the higher and lower heights. Posture and muscular demands during pallet wrapping tasks are sensitive to both wrapping technique and wrapping height. Ergonomics interventions such as this device may mitigate postural risks associated with manual material handling tasks.",2021,93,,103378,10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103378,#2907,Maciukiewicz 2021,Manual exertions
239,18158372.0,Muscular reactivity and specificity in chronic back pain patients.,Psychosom Med,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the muscular reactivity of patients with chronic back pain (CBP) to different psychological stressors with the reactions of healthy controls. We also investigated the specificity of muscular reaction near the site of pain in comparison to distal sites. The symptom-specificity model of chronic pain postulates that increased muscle tension in CBP patients may be responsible for the development and maintenance of chronic pain. METHOD: We studied a total of 54 CBP patients with musculoskeletal pain of the lower back, midback, or neck and 62 healthy controls, matched with CPB patients. Muscle tension and skin conductance level (SCL) were assessed. The four experimental conditions included back focusing, a personally relevant stressor, a cognitive stressor, and a social stressor. RESULTS: CBP patients showed patterns of higher muscular reactivity in the lower back region for chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients during the exposure to a personally relevant stressor, a cognitive stressor, and a social stressor. Additionally, CLBP patients showed specific muscular responses in the lower back. CONCLUSION: The results support the assumptions made by the symptom-specificity model of CBP, but only for lower back, not for midback and neck. Treatment programs of CLBP should include specific combined relaxation and stress management components.",2008,70,1,125-31,10.1097/PSY.0b013e31815c6db1,#2908,Glombiewski 2008,

We previously generated a R349P desmin knock-in mouse strain as a patient-mimicking model for the corresponding most frequent human desmin mutation R350P. Since nothing is known about the age-dependent changes in the biomechanics of affected muscles, we investigated the passive and active biomechanics of small fiber bundles from young (17-23 wks), adult (25-45 wks) and aged (>60 wks) heterozygous and homozygous R349P desmin knock-in mice in comparison to wild-type littermates. We used a novel automated biomechatronics platform, the MyoRobot, to perform coherent quantitative recordings of passive (resting length-tension curves, visco-elasticity) and active (caffeine-induced force transients, pCa-force, 'slack-tests') parameters to determine age-dependent effects of the R349P desmin mutation in slow-twitch soleus and fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus small fiber bundles. We demonstrate that active force properties are not affected by this mutation while passive steady-state elasticity is vastly altered in R349P desmin fiber bundles compatible with a pre-aged phenotype exhibiting stiffer muscle preparations. Visco-elasticity on the other hand, was not altered. Our study represents the first systematic age-related characterization of small muscle fiber bundle preparation biomechanics in conjunction with inherited desminopathy.",2019,9,1,10769,10.1038/s41598-019-46723-6,#2909,Haug 2019,

The purpose of this paper is to review the pertinent anatomy, kinesiology, and neurophysiology and to outline one possible cascade of events that may contribute to more diffuse upper extremity symptoms. Scapular instability and local myofascial trigger points resulting in possible secondary muscle imbalances are described. Their possible relationship to brachial plexus irritation in addition to the implications of the irritation are also discussed. The author postulates that proximal nerve irritation in the region of the thoracic outlet and shoulder may help to account for diffuse or unrelieved symptoms following conventional treatment of distal extremity problems in patients with occupational or cumulative trauma disorders.

Maximal voluntary contractions of plantar (PF) and dorsiflexors (DF) were determined at optimal angles in knee flexion and extension in both legs of 14 children with hemiplegia (7 males, 7 females) and 14 with diplegia (8 males, 6 females). Their results were compared to 14 age- and weight-matched control participants (5 males, 9 females). Muscle cross-sectional areas of soleus, posterior, and anterior compartment muscles were determined from MRIs in 14 children with CP (eight diplegia, six hemiplegia) and 18 control children. Specific tension (torque/unit area) of PF and DF was determined from torque and cross-sectional area results. Muscle volumes of PF and DF were also determined in both legs of five control children and five with hemiplegia. Muscle EMG was recorded from soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior during each maximal voluntary contraction. Mean amplitude was significantly reduced in PF and DF in both CP groups and significantly higher levels of coactivation of antagonists were found compared to control participants. Strength of PF and DF was significantly reduced in both CP groups, but more importantly the muscles were found to be weak based on significantly reduced specific tensions. The PF were most affected, particularly in the group with hemiplegia. It is believed that an inability to maximally activate their muscles contributed to this weakness. A combination of incomplete activation and high levels of PF coactivation are thought to have contributed to DF weakness.",2003,45,8,542-50,10.1017/s0012162203000999,#2911,Elder 2003,
243,25256740.0,Manual therapy and exercise to improve outcomes in patients with muscle tension dysphonia: a case series.,Phys Ther,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), a common voice disorder that is not commonly referred for physical therapy intervention, is characterized by excessive muscle recruitment, resulting in incorrect vibratory patterns of vocal folds and an alteration in voice production. This case series was conducted to determine whether physical therapy including manual therapy, exercise, and stress management education would be beneficial to this population by reducing excess muscle tension. CASE DESCRIPTION: Nine patients with MTD completed a minimum of 9 sessions of the intervention. Patient-reported outcomes of pain, function, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and the conclusion of treatment. The outcome measures were the numeric rating scale (NRS), Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and Voice Handicap Index (VHI). Cervical and jaw range of motion also were assessed at baseline and postintervention using standard goniometric measurements. OUTCOMES: Eight of the patients had no pain after treatment. All 9 of the patients demonstrated an improvement in PSFS score, with 7 patients exceeding a clinically meaningful improvement at the conclusion of the intervention. Three of the patients also had a clinically meaningful change in VHI scores. All 9 of the patients demonstrated improvement in cervical flexion and lateral flexion and jaw opening, whereas 8 patients improved in cervical extension and rotation postintervention. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that physical therapists can feasibly implement an intervention to improve outcomes in patients with MTD. However, a randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm the results of this case series and the efficacy of the intervention. A clinical implication is the expansion of physical therapy to include referrals from voice centers for the treatment of MTD.",2015,95,1,117-28,10.2522/ptj.20130547,#2912,Tomlinson 2015,
244,9817715.0,Human lung parenchyma responds to contractile stimulation.,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,"Tissue resistance increases after agonist challenge. Parenchymal contractile cells may be the responsible element. We investigated the viscoelastic properties of human parenchymal strips before and after challenge with acetylcholine (ACh) (10(-)3 M). Thirteen subpleural strips were oscillated in the organ bath, and measurements of resistance (R), elastance (E), and hysteresivity (eta) were obtained. After physiologic measurements, tissues were fixed for morphometric and immunohistochemical analysis. We quantitated the volume proportion of alveolar, airway, and blood vessel wall in individual strips. Smooth-muscle-specific actin was identified using a monoclonal antibody and the volume proportion of actin quantitated by point counting. After ACh, there was a significant increase in tension (2.6 +/- 0.6%), R (11.0 +/- 1.8%), E (4.3 +/- 0.7%), and eta (8.2 +/- 2.4%) (p < 0.002). Four strips contained no identifiable airways, yet in strips with and without airways there was no difference in the magnitude of the mechanical response or in the volume proportion of smooth-muscle-specific actin in the alveolar walls. We conclude that human lung parenchymal strips respond to ACh challenge with changes in dynamic mechanical behavior. Furthermore, small airways are not required for such a response to occur. This implicates a direct contractile response at the level of the alveolar wall and/or the alveolar duct.",1998,158,5 Pt 1,1607-12,10.1164/ajrccm.158.5.9801068,#2913,Dolhnikoff 1998,
245,12913765.0,Pharmacological characterization of isolated human prostate.,J Urol,"PURPOSE: Human prostate contains alpha-1 adrenergic, cholinergic and nonadrenergic noncholinergic neuroreceptors. Using agonistic and antagonistic agents at these neuroreceptors we studied the resultant contractile responses in isolated human prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human prostate tissue was obtained at prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia in 37 adult male patients. Tissues were suspended in tissue bath chambers connected to force displacement transducers. Specimens were subjected to agonist induced contractions, the first always being norepinephrine (NE). Specimens were pretreated with antagonist (adrenergic, cholinergic, nonadrenergic noncholinergic or none if control), followed by contraction with a second agonist (NE or other). Contractile tensions were recorded on a polygraph and then statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The order of highest to lowest agonist induced tensile forces was NE, dopamine, acetylcholine, bethanechol, histamine and serotonin. Excitatory concentration EC(50) values were determined for each agonist tested. Significant differences were found between specific alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blockers (terazosin, prazosin and the experimental drug LY253352). In addition, many other agents antagonized the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor. Inhibitory concentration IC(50) values were obtained and the order of alpha-1 adrenergic antagonistic strengths from strongest to weakest was LY253352, prazosin, terazosin, ketanserin, SCH23390, diphenhydramine, DO710, dopamine, serotonin and histamine. CONCLUSIONS: Human prostate neuroreceptors were determined to be alpha-1 adrenergic, dopaminergic, muscarinic cholinergic, 2A serotonergic and H1 histaminergic. Dopamine, serotonin, histamine and their antagonists blocked the adrenergic response, indicating possible receptor-receptor interaction.

A three dimensional computer graphics model was developed in order to estimate individual muscle contributions in each degree of freedom over the full range of motion generated by 17 muscles crossing the elbow and forearm. Optimal fiber length, tendon slack length, and muscle specific tension values were adjusted within the literature range from cadaver studies such that the net isometric joint moments of the model approximated experimental joint moments within one standard deviation. Analysis of the model revealed that the muscles operate on varying portions of the ascending limb, plateau region, and descending limb of the force-length curve. This model can be used to further understand isometric force and moment contributions of individual muscles to net joint moments of the arm and forearm and can serve as a comprehensive reference for the forces and moments generated by 17 major muscles crossing the elbow and wrist.",2011,44,4,650-6,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2010.11.009,#2915,Hale 2011,
247,29546510.0,The quadriceps active ratio: a dynamic MRI-based assessment of patellar height.,Eur J Orthop Surg Traumatol,"INTRODUCTION: Patella alta (PA) is one of the primary correctable risk factors for patellofemoral instability (PFI). Both an accurate diagnosis of PA and a clinically relevant target for correction are necessary for optimal treatment. An ideal test for PA should relate the position of the patella to the femur rather than tibia, should do so with the quadriceps contracted and the patellar tendon under tension and should have good sensitivity and specificity. None of the currently used radiographic tests PA meet these criteria, most of which are based on the position of the patella relative to the tibia with diagnostic cutoffs based on 2 standard deviations from the mean rather than optimal sensitivity and specificity. The authors describe the quadriceps active ratio (Q+R), an MRI-based assessment of PA based on patellofemoral contact under quadriceps activated with a cutoff based on optimal sensitivity a specificity for PFI. MATERIAL-METHODS: Ninety-four participants investigated for knee pain or instability with a clinically indicated MRI were recruited. Routine MRI sequences were obtained, with the addition of a quadriceps contracted sagittal T1-weighted sequence. Participants presenting with PFI were identified. Those with trochlear dysplasia were identified and excluded from analysis so that patellar height could be assessed against PFI without being confounded by trochlear dysplasia. Q+R and patellotrochlear index (PTI) were calculated from the remaining 78 scans by 3 consultant orthopaedic surgeons at three time points. In 54 of these cases, a lateral radiograph was available from which the Insall-Salvati, modified Insall-Salvati, Caton-Deschamps and Blackburn-Peel ratios were also calculated. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was assessed for the Q+R. A cutoff value for the Q+R based on optimal sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PFI was calculated from receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and compared to the PTI. The cutoff for the Q+R was compared for sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of PFI against the radiographic ratios. RESULTS: The Q+R had satisfactory or better ICC values across time points and surgeons. The Q+R was superior to the PTI on area under curve ROC analysis (0.76 vs 0.74). A cutoff value of 0.12 for the Q+R gave sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 55% for the diagnosis of PFI. The radiographic indices were generally insensitive for this diagnosis of PFI with sensitivities ranging from 0-66%. CONCLUSION: The Q+R is a reliable diagnostic test for patellar height assessment, showing good intra- and inter-rater consistency, and greater diagnostic accuracy than the PTI.

248,10667496.0,Acute quadriplegia and loss of muscle myosin in patients treated with nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids: mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels.,Crit Care Med,"OBJECTIVE: Long-term treatment with nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids in the intensive care unit is not benign, and an increasing number of patients with acute quadriplegic myopathy have been reported with increased use of these drugs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying acute quadriplegic myopathy. DESIGN: Percutaneous muscle biopsy samples were obtained, and electrophysiologic examinations were performed during the acute phase and during recovery in patients with acute quadriplegic myopathy. Regulation of muscle contraction and myofibrillar protein synthesis was studied using cell physiologic techniques, ultrasensitive electrophoresis, in situ hybridization, and histopathologic techniques. SETTING: All patients were seen in the intensive care unit of different university hospitals. PATIENTS: All patients were critically ill with sepsis. They had been given massive doses of corticosteroids in combination with variable doses of neuromuscular blocking agents. All patients developed paralysis of spinal nerve-innervated muscles. On the other hand, cranial nerve-innervated muscle and sensory and cognitive functions were well maintained after discontinuation of treatment with neuromuscular blocking agents. INTERVENTION: Muscle biopsy samples were obtained and electrophysiologic examinations were performed in all patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The major observations in patients with acute quadriplegic myopathy were, as follows: a) a general decrease in myofibrillar protein content; b) specific but highly variable partial or complete loss of myosin and myosin-associated proteins; c) very low thick-filament/thin-filament protein ratios; d) absence of myosin messenger RNA; and e) a dramatically impaired muscle cell force-generating capacity in the acute phase of acute quadriplegic myopathy. During clinical improvement, normal expression of myosin messenger RNAs, reexpression of thick-filament proteins, and increased specific tension were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Acute quadriplegic myopathy is associated with a specific decrease in thick-filament proteins related to an altered transcription rate. Although the decreased content of thick-filament proteins is important for prolonged muscle weakness, it is not the primary cause of muscle paralysis in the acute stage, during which impaired muscle membrane excitability probably plays a more significant role. Several factors contribute to this condition, but the action of corticosteroids seems to be the predominant one, along with potentiation by neuromuscular blocking agents, immobilization, and probably also concurrent sepsis.",2000,28,1,34-45,10.1097/00003246-200001000-00006,#2917,Larsson 2000,
249,23565582.0,An in vivo analysis of the effect and duration of treatment with botulinum toxin type A using digital image speckle correlation.,Skin Res Technol,"BACKGROUND: Use of Botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) for facial wrinkles is well-documented, but current methods of subjective evaluation by clinicians and patients fail to objectively quantify the magnitude and duration of facial muscle paralysis. OBJECTIVE: (a) Determine the locus of facial muscular tension; (b) Quantify and monitor muscular paralysis and subsequent return; (c) Continuously correlate the appearance of wrinkles and muscular tension using non-invasive digital image speckle correlation (DISC) to measure treatment efficacy; (d) Corroborate objective data with existing rating scales (subject global assessment and facial lines outcome-11). METHODS: Two sequential images of slight facial motion (frowning, raising eyebrows) are taken with a camera for n = 6 patients pre- and post-treatment at different time points up to 24 weeks. DISC processes the images to produce a vector map of muscular displacement to obtain spatially resolved information regarding facial tension. RESULTS: We observed maximum paralysis (≥70%) at 2 weeks, and the rate of recovery varied widely ranging from 2 to 5 months, with two patients continuing to exhibit reduced contraction at 24 weeks. Vector analysis of pre-treatment contraction correctly predicted injection site and illustrated lines of maximum tension. CONCLUSIONS: Digital image speckle correlation can precisely track the degree of contraction of different muscle groups following BTX-A injection. It can help predict injection site, quantify muscle paralysis, and monitor the recovery following BTX-A injection. Results were found to be reproducible across six patients.",2013,19,3,220-9,10.1111/srt.12010,#2918,Bhatnagar 2013,botulinum toxin type A
250,17484058.0,The face recurve concept: medical and surgical applications.,Aesthetic Plast Surg,"The application of the Face Recurve theory gives rise to new technical opportunities in the fields of both aesthetic medicine and aesthetic surgery to block the action of the age marker fascicules largely responsible for aging of the paramedian folds. With respect to aesthetic medicine, the combination of botulinum toxin and soft tissue fillers has proven effective. On the basis of the authors' theory, however, two new technical refinements become pertinent. First, the filler must be injected predominantly deep to the muscle to treat the skin depressions in a more natural manner, bringing restoration to the curve of the overlying muscle. Second, a very low number of botulinum toxin units (one-fourth to one unit) should be injected into specific muscles to diminish their resting tone without diminishing their maximal contraction strength. With respect to aesthetic surgery, the authors present new techniques for the treatment of early aging, specifically a combination of segmental muscular section, microliposuction, and retromuscular fat grafting, all of which can be performed readily with the patient under local anesthesia. For more advanced aging, surgery offers new treatment opportunities that include the concentric malar lift for correction of the midface region, with repositioning of suborbicularis oculi fat back onto the orbital rim from its descended eccentric displacement at the hands of repeated orbicularis oculi contractions. At the same time, specific muscles can be weakened and fat volume restored. Each area can be studied in a specific way and treated definitively. Currently, the skin does not need to be tensioned to a maximum during a face-lift for treatment of the irregular jaw line, the palpebromalar groove, and so forth. Skin tension can be moderated to remove only the true excess of skin. Facial contour is improved, whereas the specific glide is restored between muscles and their underlying fat.",2007,31,3,219-31; discussion 232,10.1007/s00266-006-0025-8,#2919,LeLouarn 2007,
251,22836789.0,The obliquus capitis inferior myodural bridge.,Clin Anat,"This study was designed to examine the obliquus capitis inferior (OCI) muscle from a gross anatomical perspective. The objective was to isolate and identify the OCI myodural bridge, while examining its course and contributing elements. An earlier study of the posterior cervical spine briefly reported a connection between the OCI and the cervical dura mater. To the best of our knowledge, a study has not yet been conducted specifically on this muscle and its relation to the dura mater. In this study, the suboccipital regions of nine embalmed cadavers were dissected. A total of 14 OCI muscles were isolated for examination. All findings were documented via photograph. Of the 14 OCI muscles isolated, all emitted fibrous tissue bands from the anterolateral portion of the muscular belly. These fibers attached to the posterolateral cervical dura mater by route of the atlantoaxial interspace. The OCI myodural bridge appeared to coalesce with the rectus capitis posterior major myodural bridge, giving the appearance of a single atlantoaxial structure that links these two muscles to the dura mater. In conclusion, the OCI was attached to the dura mater in all of the 14 muscle specimens. We hypothesize that the OCI myodural bridge may play a physiological role in monitoring dural tension and preventing dural infolding. It may also contribute to certain clinical symptoms manifesting from alterations in dural tone.",2013,26,4,450-4,10.1002/ca.22134,#2920,Pontell 2013,
252,17396007.0,Application of skinned single muscle fibres to determine myofilament function in ageing and disease.,J Musculoskelet Neuronal Interact,"The chemically skinned fibre is a suitable preparation to determine whether alterations in myofilament function contribute to muscle dysfunction during ageing and disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this preparation the sarcolemma is chemically permeabilized and the myofilament lattice kept intact, functioning under controlled near-physiological conditions. As force generating capacity is an important determinant of muscle function and is related to fibre crosssectional area (FCSA), we compared several methods employed by researchers to determine FCSA. Specific tension, force divided by FCSA, has a co-efficient of variation of 27%, 37%, or 30% when the FCSA was measured from the width and depth assuming an elliptical circumference, the width assuming a circular circumference, and the width while the fibre was suspended in the air, respectively. The last method showed the closest relation with the FCSA in histological sections. The velocity of maximal unloaded shortening (V(0)) varied with fibre type, with fibres expressing the Beta/slow (type I) myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform being the slowest and fibres expressing the IIb MyHC isoform the fastest. While muscle weakness experienced after surgery could not be explained by changes in specific tension or FCSA of individual fibres, the preparation revealed significant changes in myofilament function during ageing and COPD.",2007,7,1,56-61,,#2921,Degens 2007,
253,12492780.0,Strength and power changes of the human plantar flexors and knee extensors in response to resistance training in old age.,Acta Physiol Scand,"AIM: The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the improvements of muscle strength and power induced by a 16-week resistive programme in a population of 16 older men aged 65-81 years. METHODS: Training was performed three times per week at an intensity of 80% of one repetition maximum (1RM) and consisted of both calf raise and leg press exercises. Before-, during- and after-training, maximum isometric and isokinetic torques, maximum power, 1RM, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and electromyographic activity (EMG) of the plantar flexors (PF) and knee extensors (KE) were examined. RESULTS: For the KE and PF, respectively, training resulted in a 29.9 +/- 4.4% (mean +/- SE) and 21.6 +/- 5.4% increase in 1RM (P < 0.001-0.01), a 19.4 +/- 4.3 and 12.4 +/- 4.7% (P < 0.001-0.05) increase in maximum isometric torque, and a 24.1 +/- 6.3 and 33.1 +/- 10.9% (P < 0.05) increase in maximum muscle power, calculated from torque-angular velocity curves. The large increase in torque and power was partly accounted by a significant increase in the CSA of the PF (5.0 +/- 0.7%) and KE (7.4 +/- 0.7%), while no significant changes in integrated EMG activity of vastus lateralis and soleus muscles, and in extrapolated maximum shortening velocity were found. After training, a significant increase in torque/CSA (10.3 +/- 4%, P < 0.05) was found for the KE but not for the PF. CONCLUSION: Hence, hypertrophy cannot alone justify the increase in torque, and other factors, such as an increase in individual fibre-specific tension (in the case of KE), a decrease in antagonist muscles' coactivation, an improved co-ordination and an increased neural drive of the other heads of quadriceps may have contributed to the increments in strength. The significant increase in muscle power seems particularly noteworthy with respect to daily activities involving the displacement of the body over time, namely, the generation of muscle power.",2003,177,1,69-78,10.1046/j.1365-201X.2003.01050.x,#2922,Ferri 2003,
254,12944436.0,The ryanodine contracture test may help diagnose susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.,Can J Anaesth,"PURPOSE: The ryanodine contracture test (RCT) using the plant alkaloid ryanodine as the triggering agent has been proposed to reduce equivocal results of the in vitro caffeine-halothane-contracture test (IVCT), which is the accepted and standardized procedure to diagnose malignant hyperthermia (MH). However, the response of skeletal muscle of non-MH affected patients (controls) to ryanodine has not yet been characterized. METHODS: Skeletal muscle biopsies were studied in 33 controls and in six patients with a history of fulminant MH. Following the IVCT, the RCT was performed in all specimens using ryanodine 1 micro M. Onset time of contracture and time to reach a contracture level of 10 mN above lowest resting tension and above predrug tension were calculated. RESULTS: With the standard IVCT, all controls were labelled MH non-susceptible; all clinically diagnosed MH patients were labelled MH susceptible. With ryanodine, control muscle differed from MH susceptible muscle regarding onset time of contracture (26 vs 3.8 min, P < 0.05) and time to reach a contracture of 10 mN (49 vs 12.5 min, P < 0.05; all median). Tissue viability and patient's age significantly influenced contracture times. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the highly specific binding of ryanodine at the myocytic sarcoplasmic reticulum, the wide range of contracture times of the controls points toward heterogeneity of ryanodine receptors within physiologic limits. This may also be caused in part by tissue viability and the patients' age. The ryanodine contracture test performed in addition to the IVCT may add clarity into diagnosing a patient as MH-susceptible or not.",2003,50,7,643-8,10.1007/BF03018704,#2924,Reuter 2003,
255,11571218.0,Respiratory muscle strength and ventilatory failure in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,Brain,"Although ventilatory failure is the most common cause of death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and measurement of respiratory muscle strength (RMS) has been shown to have prognostic value, no single test of strength can predict the presence of hypercapnia reliably. RMS was measured in 81 ALS patients to evaluate the relationship between tests of RMS and the presence of ventilatory failure, defined as a carbon dioxide tension > or = 6 kPa. We studied the predictive value of vital capacity (VC), static inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures (MIP, MEP), maximal sniff oesophageal (sniff P(oes)), transdiaphragmatic (sniff P(di)) and nasal (SNP) pressure, cough gastric (cough P(gas)) pressure and transdiaphragmatic pressure after bilateral cervical magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation (CMS P(di)) to identify the risk of ventilatory failure in the whole group and in subgroups of patients with and without significant bulbar involvement. For patients without significant bulbar involvement, sniff P(di) had greatest predictive power [odds ratio (OR) 57] with specificity, sensitivity and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of 87, 90, 74 and 95%, respectively Of the less invasive tests, per cent predicted SNP had greater overall predictive power (OR 25, specificity 85%, sensitivity 81%) than per cent predicted VC (9, 89%, 53%) and per cent predicted MIP (6, 83%, 55%). No test had significant predictive power for the presence of hypercapnia when used to measure RMS in a subgroup of patients with significant bulbar weakness. Thirty-five patients underwent polysomnography. CMS P(di), sniff P(di) and per cent predicted SNP were significantly correlated with the apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) (P = 0.035, 0.042 and 0.026, respectively). The correlations between AHI and per cent predicted MIP and VC were less strong (both non-significant). In ALS patients without significant bulbar involvement, novel tests of RMS have greater predictive power than conventional tests to predict hypercapnia. In particular, the non-invasive SNP is more sensitive than VC and MIP, suggesting that it could usefully be included in tests of respiratory muscle strength in ALS and will be helpful in assessing the risk of ventilatory failure. In patients with significant bulbar involvement, tests of respiratory muscle strength do not predict hypercapnia. Sleep-disordered breathing is correlated with RMS and the novel tests of RMS having the strongest relationship with the degree of sleep disturbance.",2001,124,Pt 10,2000-13,10.1093/brain/124.10.2000,#2925,Lyall 2001,
256,31736339.0,Loop analysis of the anal sphincter complex in fecal incontinent patients using functional luminal imaging probe.,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,"Cardiac loops have been used extensively to study myocardial function. With changes in cardiac pump function, loops are shifted to the right or left. Functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP) recordings allow for loop analysis of the anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle (PRM) function. The goal was to characterize anal sphincter area-pressure/tension loop changes in fecal incontinence (FI) patients. Fourteen healthy subjects and 14 patients with FI were studied. A custom-designed FLIP was placed in the vagina and then in the anal canal, and deflated in 20-ml steps, from 90 to 30 ml. At each volume, subjects performed maximal voluntary squeezes. Area-pressure (AP) and area-tension (AT) loops were generated for each squeeze cycle. Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging of the anal sphincter and PRM were obtained to determine the relationship between anal sphincter muscle damage and loop movements. With the increase in bag volume, AP loops and AT loops shifted to the right and upward in normal subjects (both anal and vaginal). The shift to the right was greater, and the upward movement was less in FI patients. The difference in the location of AP loops and AT loops was statistically significant at volumes of 50 ml to 90 ml (P < 0.05). A similar pattern was found in the vaginal loops. There is a significant relationship between the damage to the anal sphincter and PRM, and loop location of FI patients. We propose AP and AT loops as novel ways to assess the anal sphincter and PRM function. Such loops can be generated by real-time measurement of pressure and area within the anal canal.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We describe the use of area-pressure (AP) and area-tension (AT)-loop analysis of the anal sphincters and puborectalis muscles in normal subjects and fecal incontinent patients using the functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP). There are differences in the magnitude of the displacement of the loops with increase in the FLIP bag volume between normal subjects and patients with fecal incontinence. The latter group shifts more to the right in AP and AT space.",2020,318,1,G66-G76,10.1152/ajpgi.00164.2019,#2926,Zifan 2020,area-pressure/tension loops
257,9295142.0,"Complete cDNA sequence and tissue localization of N-RAP, a novel nebulin-related protein of striated muscle.",Cell Motil Cytoskeleton,"We have cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA of N-RAP, a novel nebulin-related protein, from mouse skeletal muscle. The N-RAP message is specifically expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but is not detected by Northern blot in non-muscle tissues. The full-length N-RAP cDNA contains an open reading frame of 3,525 base pairs which is predicted to encode a protein of 133 kDa. A 587 amino acid region near the C-terminus is 45% identical to the actin binding region of human nebulin, containing more than 2 complete 245 residue nebulin super repeats. The N-terminus contains the consensus sequence of a cysteine-rich LIM domain, which may function in mediating protein-protein interactions. These data suggest that the encoded protein may link actin filaments to some other proteins or structure. We expressed full-length N-RAP in Escherichia coli, as well as the nebulin-like super repeat region of N-RAP (N-RAP-SR) and the region between the LIM domain and N-RAP-SR (N-RAP-IB). An anti-N-RAP antibody raised against a 30 amino acid peptide corresponding to sequence from N-RAP-IB detected recombinant N-RAP and N-RAP-IB, but failed to detect N-RAP-SR. This antibody specifically identified a 185 kDa band as N-RAP on immunoblots of mouse skeletal and cardiac muscle proteins. In an assay of actin binding to electrophoresed and blotted proteins, we detected significant actin binding to expressed nebulin super repeats and N-RAP-SR, but only a trace amount of binding to N-RAP-IB. In immunofluorescence experiments, N-RAP was found to be localized at the myotendinous junction in mouse skeletal muscle and at the intercalated disc in cardiac muscle. Based on its domain organization, actin binding properties, and tissue localization, we propose that N-RAP plays a role in anchoring the terminal actin filaments in the myofibril to the membrane and may be important in transmitting tension from the myofibrils to the extracellular matrix.",1997,38,1,75-90,10.1002/(SICI)1097-0169(1997)38:1<75::AID-CM7>3.0.CO;2-G,#2927,Luo 1997,

METHODS: Isometric tension of artery ring segments was recorded by a sensitive myograph system in vitro and the relative amount of alpha-adrenoreceptor mRNA was quantified by a real-time PCR. RESULTS: Noradrenaline (NA)-induced concentration-contraction curve of mesenteric artery segments in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was more potent than that in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The E(max) of NA in SHR was 1.82 times of that of WKY. The concentration-contractile curve induced by NA in great omental arteries of hypertensives significantly shifted toward left and the pD2 value of NA was larger than that of normotensives. After organ culture, the concentration-contractile curves of SD rat mesenteric artery induced by NA shifted toward left with significantly increased E(max). The relative amounts of mRNA for alpha1-adrenoreceptor was increased, but mRNA level for alpha2-adrenoreceptor did not change.

259,10932494.0,The clavicular fracture: a biomechanical study of the mechanism of clavicular fracture and modes of the fracture.,J Med Assoc Thai,"A clavicle is an S-shaped long bone whose biomechanical behavior is unlike that of a straight tubular long bone. When a clavicle is under a compression load along the axis, the force produces a middle one-third clavicular fracture. The present study is a biomechanical study to confirm the clinical observations of the mechanism of the fracture and to discover the tension site and compression site of the fracture, using 12 fresh cadaveric clavicles, a universal testing machine and two special grips. One grip was constructed with a contour like a sternoclavicular articulation. The grip was mounted at the medial end of the clavicle. Another grip was constructed with a contour like an acromioclavicular articulation. The grip was mounted at the lateral end of the clavicle. A load was applied to the lateral clavicle like a force transmitting from the weight of the shoulder girdle. A load was also applied to the medial clavicle like a force from the sternocleidomastoid muscle. A compression load was applied along the axis of the testing clavicle through the upper grips by using a universal testing machine. The result found that the average load of the clavicular fracture was 1526.19 N. The fracture occurred at the middle one-third of the clavicle in the region of the curve of the lateral clavicle changing to the curve of the medial clavicle. While primatic cross section of the clavicle at the fracture site determined a tension and a compression site of the fracture, the fracture took the superoanterior aspect of the clavicle as a tension site and posteroinferior aspect as a compression site. The fracture had a ratio of length of the lateral fragment to the total length of the clavicle of 0.49. This study confirmed that a compression load along the axis of the clavicle produces a middle one-third clavicular fracture as in clinical observation and the fracture took the superoanterior aspect of the clavicle as a tension site.",2000,83,6,663-7,,#2929,Harnroongroj 2000,

We investigated maximum inspiratory pressure after exhalation to residual volume (MIP), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) and time of inspiration during quiet breathing and derived inspiratory muscle load (P0.1/MIP), and tension time index (TTI) in 301 healthy schoolchildren 6-16 years old. Gender-specific and age-dependent percentile curves for MIP were drawn with the median, 5%, 10%, 25%, 75% and 95% percentile. P0.1 was equal in boys and girls (0.23  ±  0.11 kPa), while MIP was significantly higher in boys (6.8  ±  2.2 versus 5.8  ±  2.4 kPa).

Galvani who took credit for it. J. Swammerdam had already shown the Duke of Tuscany in 1658 the mechanics of muscular contraction. Even if 'electrology or localised electrisation' - the original terminology for electromyography (EMG) - contained the oldest biological scientific detection and measuring techniques, EMG remained a 'supporting' measurement with limited discriminating use, except in conjunction with other methods. All this changed when EMG became a diagnostic tool for studies of muscle weakness, fatigue, pareses, paralysis. and nerve conduction velocities, lesions of the motor unit or for neurogenic and myogenic problems. In addition to the measurement qualities, the electrical signal could be induced as functional electrical stimulation (FES), which developed as a specific rehabilitation tool. Almost in parallel and within the expanding area of EMG, a speciality developed wherein the aim was to use EMG for the study of muscular function and coordination of muscles in different movements and postures. Kinesiological EMG and therewith surface EMG can be applied in studies of normal muscle function during selected movements and postures; muscle activity in complex sports; occupational and rehabilitation movements; isometric contraction with increasing tension up to the maximal voluntary contraction, evaluation of functional anatomical muscle activity (validation of classical anatomical functions); coordination and synchronization studies (kinematic chain); specificity and efficiency of training methods; fatigue; the relationship between EMG and force; the human-machine interaction; the influence of material on muscle activity, occupational loading in relation to lower back pain and joint kinematics. Within these various applications the recording system (e.g. the signal detection, the volume conduction, signal amplification, impedance and frequency responses, the signal characteristics) and the data-processing system (e.g. rectification, linear envelope and normalization methods) go hand in hand with a critical appraisal of choices, limits and possibilities.",2000,43,10,1750-62,10.1080/001401300750004159,#2931,Clarys 2000,

Muscle torque recordings were compared at the same muscle length (knee angle) and the torque was calculated as the average torque at each angle over a large knee angle range (75 degrees -25 degrees ) to reduce the influence of small torque oscillation on the calculated torque. Muscle torque at fast (240 degrees s(-1)) versus slow (30 degrees s(-1)) speeds of movement, torque normalized to muscle cross-sectional area (specific tension), and absolute torque at fast speeds of movement were measured in 34 young healthy male and female short-, middle-, and long-distance runners. The relationship between the different measures of muscle function and the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms using enzyme-histochemical and electrophoretic protein separation techniques were investigated. A significant correlation between the 240 degrees s(-1) vs 30 degrees s(-1) torque ratio and the relative area of the type II fibers and type II MyHC isoforms were observed in both the men (r=0.74; P<0.001) and the women (r=0.81; P<0.05).

263,11562907.0,Disparate dysfunction of skeletal muscles located near and distant from burn site in the rat.,Muscle Nerve,"This study tested the hypotheses that burn-induced change in muscle function varies at sites local and distant from burn and is related to changes in expression of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and muscle mass. In anesthetized rats, approximately 4% burn was inflicted over the tibialis anterior muscle of one limb. The contralateral leg served as control. In another study, a approximately 45% body surface area burn was produced on the trunk; controls were body sham-burned rats. The evoked twitch tensions of tibialis anterior muscles in both legs were measured together with AChR proteins and their transcripts. Compared with the contralateral leg, absolute tensions in the burned leg declined at days 1, 4, and 7 without loss of muscle mass so that tension per unit wet muscle mass (specific tension) decreased; at day 14, the tension decreased with muscle atrophy so that specific tension was unchanged. Membrane AChRs and/or the immature subunit transcript, AChRgamma messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) increased at days 4, 7, and 14, and both were inversely related to evoked tension (r =.43, P <.01 and r =.61, P <.0001, respectively). There was a direct correlation between AChR and AChRgamma mRNA (r =.82, P <.001), suggesting that the upregulated AChRs may contain the immature gamma-subunit isoform. After approximately 45% body burn, AChRs and mRNA did not change and the evoked tensions did not decline, but there was relative loss of muscle mass at days 7 and 14 so that specific tension increased. Burn trauma initially causes weakness of muscles directly under the burn, and this weakness may be partially related to increased expression of immature AChRs and later to muscle atrophy.",2001,24,10,1283-94,10.1002/mus.1146,#2933,Ibebunjo 2001,
264,7701385.0,The posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia. Its function in load transfer from spine to legs.,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),"STUDY DESIGN: The superficial and deep lamina of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia have been studied anatomically and biomechanically. In embalmed human specimens, the posterior layer has been loaded by simulating the action of various muscles. The effect has been studied using raster photography. OBJECTIVES: To study the role of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia in load transfer between spine, pelvis, legs, and arms. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It has been determined whether muscles such as the gluteus maximus, latissimus dorsi, erector muscle, and biceps femoris are functionally coupled via the thoracolumbar fascia. The caudal relations of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia have not been previously studied. METHODS: Dissection was directed to the bilaminar posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia of 10 human specimens. The superficial and deep lamina were studied using visual inspection and raster photography. Tension to the posterior layer of the fascia was simulated by traction to various muscles and measured by studying the displacement in the posterior layer. RESULTS: Traction to a variety of muscles caused displacement of the posterior layer. This implies that in vivo, the superficial lamina will be tensed by contraction of various muscles, such as the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus and erector muscle, and the deep lamina by contraction of the biceps femoris. Caudal to the level of L4 (in some specimens, L2-L3), tension in the posterior layer was transmitted to the contralateral side. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic structures normally described as hip, pelvic, and leg muscles interact with so-called arm and spinal muscles via the thoracolumbar fascia. This allows for effective load transfer between spine, pelvis, legs, and arms--an integrated system. Specific electromyographic studies should reveal whether the gluteus maximus muscle and contralateral latissimus dorsi muscle are functionally coupled, especially during rotation of the trunk. In that case, the combined action of these muscles assists in rotating the trunk, while simultaneously stabilizing the lower lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints.",1995,20,7,753-8,,#2934,Vleeming 1995,
265,12751284.0,Modeling the human body/seat system in a vibration environment.,J Biomech Eng,"The vibration environment is a common man-made artificial surrounding with which humans have a limited tolerance to cope due to their body dynamics. This research studied the dynamic characteristics of a seated human body/seat system in a vibration environment. The main result is a multi degrees of freedom lumped parameter model that synthesizes two basic dynamics: (i) global human dynamics, the apparent mass phenomenon, including a systematic set of the model parameters for simulating various conditions like body posture, backrest, footrest, muscle tension, and vibration directions, and (ii) the local human dynamics, represented by the human pelvis/vibrating seat contact, using a cushioning interface. The model and its selected parameters successfully described the main effects of the apparent mass phenomenon compared to experimental data documented in the literature. The model provided an analytical tool for human body dynamics research. It also enabled a primary tool for seat and cushioning design. The model was further used to develop design guidelines for a composite cushion using the principle of quasi-uniform body/seat contact force distribution. In terms of evenly distributing the contact forces, the best result for the different materials and cushion geometries simulated in the current study was achieved using a two layer shaped geometry cushion built from three materials. Combining the geometry and the mechanical characteristics of a structure under large deformation into a lumped parameter model enables successful analysis of the human/seat interface system and provides practical results for body protection in dynamic environment.",2003,125,2,223-31,10.1115/1.1559894,#2935,Rosen 2003,
266,16502490.0,Quantitative EMG changes during 12-week DeLorme's axiom strength training.,Yonsei Med J,"Strength training is one of the most common exercises practiced in the field of physical therapy or sports training. However, limited methodology is available to evaluate its effect on the target muscle. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that surface electromyographic (EMG) data from both isometric and isotonic exercise can express changes within the muscle during a 12-week strength training program. Ten healthy male volunteer students (5 for training, 5 for controls) from Yonsei University were recruited for evaluation in this study. DeLorme's axiom was practiced for 12 weeks in the dominant elbow flexors and knee extensors of the training group. Tension for 1 repetition maximum and maximal voluntary isometric contraction, and surface EMG information such as the integrated EMG and three variables from the regression line of median frequency (MDF) data were measured at weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The limb circumference was measured at weeks 0 and 12. During the strength training, which was enough for the increment of muscle strength and limb circumference, the rectified-integrated EMG and initial MDF increased with a significant linear pattern in both types of contraction. The two surface EMG variables were able to monitor the physiologic muscle changes during the training. Based on these results, we propose that these two surface EMG variables can be used for monitoring electrophysiological changes in the specific muscle that is undergoing the training program, under conditions where the contraction mode for EMG data collection is either static or dynamic.",2006,47,1,93-104,10.3349/ymj.2006.47.1.93,#2936,Shin 2006,
267,23823150.0,Long-term wheel running compromises diaphragm function but improves cardiac and plantarflexor function in the mdx mouse.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Dystrophin-deficient muscles suffer from free radical injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation, among other pathologies that contribute to muscle fiber injury and loss, leading to wheelchair confinement and death in the patient. For some time, it has been appreciated that endurance training has the potential to counter many of these contributing factors. Correspondingly, numerous investigations have shown improvements in limb muscle function following endurance training in mdx mice. However, the effect of long-term volitional wheel running on diaphragm and cardiac function is largely unknown. Our purpose was to determine the extent to which long-term endurance exercise affected dystrophic limb, diaphragm, and cardiac function. Diaphragm specific tension was reduced by 60% (P < 0.05) in mice that performed 1 yr of volitional wheel running compared with sedentary mdx mice. Dorsiflexor mass (extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior) and function (extensor digitorum longus) were not altered by endurance training. In mice that performed 1 yr of volitional wheel running, plantarflexor mass (soleus and gastrocnemius) was increased and soleus tetanic force was increased 36%, while specific tension was similar in wheel-running and sedentary groups. Cardiac mass was increased 15%, left ventricle chamber size was increased 20% (diastole) and 18% (systole), and stroke volume was increased twofold in wheel-running compared with sedentary mdx mice. These data suggest that the dystrophic heart may undergo positive exercise-induced remodeling and that limb muscle function is largely unaffected. Most importantly, however, as the diaphragm most closely recapitulates the human disease, these data raise the possibility of exercise-mediated injury in dystrophic skeletal muscle.",2013,115,5,660-6,10.1152/japplphysiol.00252.2013,#2937,Selsby 2013,Duchenne muscular dystrophy

OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between echo intensity and specific tension in middle-school boys. APPROACH: Twenty-five boys participated in this study. Sixteen (mean  ±  SD age  =  12  ±  1 years) engaged in a 16-week after-school strength and conditioning program. Nine boys (12  ±  1 years) served as controls. The program involved two 90 min sessions per week of lower-body speed, power, and resistance training. Before and after the intervention, ultrasound imaging was used to quantify vastus lateralis and rectus femoris echo intensity. MAIN RESULTS: Specific tension was calculated as voluntary isometric peak torque divided by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived thigh lean mass (Nm kg(-1)). The pretest echo intensity and specific tension data were not significantly correlated (r  =  0.040, p  =  0.850). Training resulted in a small mean increase in specific tension (change  =  1.93 Nm kg(-1); d  =  0.42). The echo intensity values were not affected by training or maturation (training change  =  -1.13 arbitrary units (A.U.); control  =  0.00 A.U.). Both variables showed no interaction and no group or time main effects. The echo intensity and specific tension change scores were not correlated for all subjects (r  =  -0.080, p  =  0.705) or groups (training r  =  -0.095, p  =  0.727; control r  =  -0.004, p  =  0.992). SIGNIFICANCE: In middle-school boys, a relationship between echo intensity and the ratio of muscle strength relative to lean mass does not exist.",2017,38,8,1529-1541,10.1088/1361-6579/aa791a,#2939,Mota 2017,

The patient had a nineteen-year history of tics and high levels of tension in his throat and facial muscles. Eventurally these problems progressed to a point that interfered with his ability to perform as a professional woodwind musician. Following detoxification from alcohol and Dexamyl, and after a period of psychotherapy, EMG biofeedback relaxation training was started for the muscles specifically showing chronically high tension levels. The EMG training consisted of four phases designed to help the patient progressively lower tension and generalize these newly learned techniques to his professional life. He had a total of twenty treatments of approximately 45 minutes each. This procedure resulted in dramatic reductions in tension levels of the specific throat and facial muscles along with increased proficiency as a musician and in psychological functioning.",1976,1,1,113-20,10.1007/BF00998694,#2940,Levee 1976,
270,22768802.0,Clinical evaluation of a matrix metalloproteinase-12 cleaved fragment of titin as a cardiovascular serological biomarker.,J Transl Med,"BACKGROUND: Titin is a muscle-specific protein found in cardiac and skeletal muscles which is responsible for restoring passive tension. Levels and functioning of titin have been shown to be affected by cardiac damage. Due to the inherent difficulty of measuring titin levels in vivo in a clinical setting, we aimed to develop an assay that could reliably measure fragments of degraded titin in serum and potentially be used in the assessment of cardiac muscle damage. METHODS: A competitive ELISA was developed to specifically measure levels of the titin sequence 12670' NVTVEARLIK 12679', derived by the degradation of titin by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12. Serum samples from 90 individuals were divided into 3 equally sized groups. One group had been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) while the remaining two were asymptomatic individuals either with CT-scan signs of coronary calcium (CT-plusCa) or without coronary calcium (CT-noCa). RESULTS: Mean geometric levels of the titin fragment in the CT-noCa group were 506.5 ng/ml (± 43.88). The CT-plusCa group showed 50.6% higher levels of the marker [763 ng/ml (± 90.14)] (P < 0.05). AMI patients showed 56.3% higher levels [792 ng/ml (± 149)] (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The titin-12670 fragment is present in both individuals with undiagnosed and diagnosed CVD. The statistically significant increase in level of the marker in the AMI group is indicative that this neoepitope biomarker may be a useful serological marker in AMI.",2012,10,,140,10.1186/1479-5876-10-140,#2941,Vassiliadis 2012,

272,12430981.0,Tissue elastance influences airway smooth muscle shortening: comparison of mechanical properties among different species.,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,"We have observed striking differences in the mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle preparations among different species. In this study, we provide a novel analysis on the influence of tissue elastance on smooth muscle shortening using previously published data from our laboratory. We have found that isolated human airways exhibit substantial passive tension in contrast to airways from the dog and pig, which exhibit little passive tension (<5% of maximal active force versus approximately 60% for human bronchi). In the dog and pig, airway preparations shorten up to 70% from Lmax (the length at which maximal active force occurs), whereas human airways shorten by only approximately 12% from Lmax. Isolated airways from the rabbit exhibit relatively low passive tension (approximately 22% Fmax) and shorten by 60% from Lmax. Morphologic evaluation of airway cross sections revealed that 25-35% of the airway wall is muscle in canine, porcine, and rabbit airways in contrast to approximately 9% in human airway preparations. We postulate that the large passive tension needed to stretch the muscle to Lmax reflects the high connective tissue content surrounding the smooth muscle, which limits shortening during smooth muscle contraction by imposing an elastic load, as well as by causing radial constraint.",2002,80,9,865-71,10.1139/y02-112,#2943,OpazoSaez 2002,
273,20206638.0,Towards multi-scale modeling of muscle fibers with sarcomere non-uniformities.,J Theor Biol,"A theoretical framework for studying the collective behavior of a large ensemble of half sarcomeres in a myofibril is presented. The approach is based on transforming the large system of discrete elements (half-sarcomeres) into a continuum for which macro-behavior is dictated by micro-properties. Specifically, we consider statistical properties of the ensemble rather than solving for each degree of freedom. This enables a reasonable computational effort and provides important insights. We demonstrate that such a multi-scale approach is indispensable for studying quantitatively the role of sarcomere non-uniformities in muscle mechanics. Specifically, we illustrate that adopting a model with a non-physiological number of sarcomeres can lead to a non-realistic behavior and therefore to erroneous interpretation. Further, we demonstrate that the new modeling approach provides a suitable platform for addressing controversial phenomena, such as residual enhanced tension, creep, length redistribution, and damage due to eccentric contraction.",2010,264,3,882-92,10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.02.048,#2944,Givli 2010,

METHOD: Force was measured with surface electromyography (EMG) from the cervical erector spinae (CES), the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and trapezius muscles during the maximal isometric neck flexion, neck extension and shoulder flexion. RESULTS: Girls with migraine-type headache had higher EMG/force ratios between the EMG of the left agonist SCM muscle and the corresponding maximal neck flexion (p = 0.030) and neck rotation force to the right side (p = 0.024) than the girls with tension-type headache. Migrainous girls had more co-activation of right antagonist CES muscle during maximal neck flexion force than the girls without headache (p = 0.015). Neck force production showed no significant differences between girls. Girls with tension-type headache displayed lower left shoulder flexion force than girls with migraine-type headache (p = 0.005) or with no headache (p = 0.005). In boys, no significant differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Girls with tension-type headache and migraine-type headache have differences in neuromuscular function in the neck-shoulder muscles. The data amplify our knowledge of the neck-shoulder muscle dysfunction in adolescent headache, and may encourage the use of specific rehabilitation methods in the management of different types of headache.",2008,30,3,231-9,10.1080/09638280701265430,#2945,Oksanen 2008,
275,8472278.0,Negative inotropic and relaxant effects of cocaine on myopathic human ventricular myocardium and epicardial coronary arteries in vitro.,Cardiovasc Res,"OBJECTIVE: Cocaine produces both vascular and myocardial effects that can lead to serious cardiovascular complications in man. Tissue catecholamine stores are known to be depleted in the advanced stages of heart failure. The effects of cocaine on cardiac and coronary smooth muscle isolated from patients with end stage heart failure was tested in order to evaluate the direct actions of this drug on human tissue. METHODS: Effects of cocaine HCl were studied on cardiac ventricular trabeculae carneae and epicardial coronary artery segments obtained at heart transplantation from patients with end stage heart failure. Muscles were placed in organ baths under physiological conditions for recording isometric tension; a subset of muscles was loaded intracellularly with the bioluminescent calcium indicator, aequorin. Cardiac muscles were stimulated with threshold pulses delivered via a punctate electrode at 0.33 Hz. Coronary segments were studied under basal conditions and after contraction with 60 mM KCl. RESULTS: In both cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle preparations, cocaine (10(-6)-10(-3) M) produced dose related negative inotropic and relaxant effects, respectively; positive inotropic actions and vasoconstriction were not seen. In cardiac muscle, the negative inotropic actions were associated with a simultaneous decrease in peak intracellular calcium levels. In contrast, cocaine induced relaxation of potassium contracted vascular smooth muscle was not associated with a fall in peak intracellular calcium levels, a result consistent with decreased myofilament calcium responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the depressant effects of cocaine on cardiac versus vascular smooth muscle occur by different mechanisms and suggest the need for specific therapeutic approaches to managing cardiac depression versus vasodilation when these occur in cocaine intoxicated patients.",1993,27,2,262-8,10.1093/cvr/27.2.262,#2946,Perreault 1993,
276,12110653.0,Phylogenetic implications of the superfast myosin in extraocular muscles.,J Exp Biol,"Extraocular muscle exhibits higher-velocity and lower-tension contractions than other vertebrate striated muscles. These distinctive physiological properties are associated with the expression of a novel extraocular myosin heavy chain (MYH). Encoded by the MYH13 gene, the extraocular myosin heavy chain is a member of the fast/developmental MYH gene cluster on human chromosome 17 and the syntenic MYH cluster on mouse chromosome 11. Comparison of cDNA sequences reveals that MYH13 also encodes the atypical MYH identified in laryngeal muscles, which have similar fast contractile properties. Comparing the MYH13 sequence with the other members of the fast/developmental cluster, the slow/cardiac MYH genes and two orphan skeletal MYH genes in the human genome provides insights into the origins of specialization in striated muscle myosins. Specifically, these studies indicate (i) that the extraocular myosin is not derived from the adult fast skeletal muscle myosins, but was the first member of the fast/developmental MYH gene cluster to diverge and specialize, (ii) that the motor and rod domains of the MYH13 have evolved under different selective pressures and (iii) that the MYH13 gene has been largely insulated from genomic events that have shaped other members of the fast/developmental cluster. In addition, phylogenetic footprinting suggests that regulation of the extraocular MYH gene is not governed primarily by myogenic factors, but by a hierarchical network of regulatory factors that relate its expression to the development of extraocular muscles.",2002,205,Pt 15,2189-201,10.1242/jeb.205.15.2189,#2947,Schachat 2002,

The present study evaluated a group of tension-type (n = 43) and migraine and tension-type (n = 30) headache patients. Measures were obtained at five muscle sites (frontalis, temporalis, masseter, splenius capitis, and trapezius) for patient ratings of headache pain, patient ratings of muscle tension, and electromyogram recording cross-sectionally.

In addition, quantitative EMGs were recorded in 547 of these subjects. The correlation between the three diagnostic tests was assessed and the discriminality and cut-off points were analysed using Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis. Local tenderness from the temporal muscles was closely related to the total tenderness scores from 14 pairs of muscles. In chronic tension-type headache, tenderness was positively related to EMG and inversely related to pain thresholds. In the episodic from the total tenderness score was inversely related to pain thresholds, whereas no significant relation to EMG was noted. The Receiver Operating Characteristics curves indicated that tenderness recorded by manual palpation was the most specific and sensitive test, whereas EMG and pain thresholds were of limited diagnostic value. Eighty-seven percent of subjects with the chronic, and 66% of subjects with the episodic form were found to have a ""muscular disorder"" defined as increased tenderness recorded by either manual palpation or pressure algometry and/or increased EMG levels.

To that purpose, modulations of motor-evoked potential (MEP) and Hoffmann (H) reflex were compared in the soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) during anisometric submaximal and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the plantar flexor muscles. For the submaximal shortening and lengthening contractions, the target torque was set at 50% of their respective MVC force. The results indicate that the amplitudes of both MEP and H-reflex responses, normalized to the maximal M wave, were significantly (P < 0.05) lower during lengthening compared with shortening submaximal contraction. For these two parameters, the reduction reached, respectively, 22.1 and 31.9% for the SOL and 34.5 and 29.3% for the MG. During MVC, normalized MEP and H reflex of the SOL were both reduced significantly by 19.9% (P < 0.05) and 29.9% (P < 0.001) during lengthening and shortening contraction, respectively, whereas no significant change (P > 0.05) was observed for MG. In addition, the silent period in the ongoing electromyogram (EMG) activity following the MEP was significantly (P < 0.01) briefer during lengthening than shortening contractions but did not differ (P > 0.05) between contraction intensities and muscles. Together, these results indicate that cortical and spinal mechanisms involved in the modulation of muscle activation during shortening and lengthening contractions differ between synergistic muscles according to the torque produced. Data further document previous studies reporting that the specific modulation of muscle activation during lengthening contraction is not torque dependent.",2014,117,12,1440-50,10.1152/japplphysiol.00489.2014,#2951,Duclay 2014,H reflex
280,16804735.0,Using myoelectric signal parameters to distinguish between computer workers with and without trapezius myalgia.,Eur J Appl Physiol,"Complaints of chronic trapezius muscle pain among computer workers have increased in prevalence during the last decade. Currently there is no clear understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in affected muscles. The major objective of this work was to determine if measurable electrophysiological differences exist between the trapezius muscles in individuals suffering from trapezius myalgia (TM) and occupation-matched pain-free control subjects. Myoelectric signal (MES) data were recorded from the upper trapezius muscle while subjects with and without myalgia performed a standardized series of postural and arm-holding tasks. MES variables reflecting muscle fatigue, muscle tension and motor control strategies were analyzed to determine their potential ability to distinguish between the two groups. One variable, RestTime, was found to be significantly different between the groups but it was not specific enough to predict group association. A multivariate logistic regression analysis yielded a model that separated the two groups with better than 70% sensitivity and 70% specificity. The variables included in the model reflect differences in trapezius muscle activity between the groups, particularly related to motor control and/or active muscle tension, but not fatigue. The model was tested using a small sample of new data, which again produced a good sensitivity (85.7%) but not specificity (42.9%). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first objective MES-based model that has successfully classified subjects with or without TM based on a simple clinical test. Further work with this model might result in understanding the pathophysiology of TM, assisting with clinical diagnosis, and testing the effect of various treatment interventions.",2006,97,2,196-209,10.1007/s00421-006-0162-4,#2952,Goudy 2006,
281,12377871.0,The effects of chronic episodic hypercapnic hypoxia on rat upper airway muscle contractile properties and fiber-type distribution.,Chest,"OBJECTIVE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by episodes of upper airway (UA) obstruction due to an inability of UA muscles such as the geniohyoids and sternohyoids to maintain airway patency. This results in chronic episodic hypercapnic hypoxia. Chronic continuous hypoxia and episodic hypocapnic hypoxia affect skeletal muscle structure and function, but the effects of chronic episodic hypercapnic hypoxia on UA muscle structure and function are unknown. DESIGN: Rats breathed air and hypercapnic hypoxic gas twice per minute for 8 h/d for 5 weeks in order to mimic the intermittent hypercapnic hypoxia of OSA in humans. Isometric contractile properties were determined using strips of isolated geniohyoid and sternohyoid muscles in physiologic saline solution at 30 degrees C. Fiber-type distribution was determined by adenosine triphosphatase staining. RESULTS: For both muscles, chronic episodic hypercapnic hypoxia had no significant effect on twitch or tetanic tension, twitch/tetanic tension ratio, and tension-frequency relationship. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in geniohyoid fatigue (50.5 +/- 6.6% vs 43.6 +/- 5.8% of initial tension), but sternohyoid fatigue was reduced (31.5 +/- 5.2% vs 37.8 +/- 6.0% of initial tension). Geniohyoid type 1 fibers were reduced and type 2B fibers increased, whereas sternohyoid muscle had an increase in type 1 and 2A fibers and a decrease in type 2B fibers.

282,2577948.0,An analysis of the sources of musculoskeletal system impedance.,J Biomech,"When antagonistic muscles co-contract, the impedance of musculoskeletal systems to applied loads is known to increase. In this paper a physiologically-based, higher-order, nonlinear antagonistic muscle-joint model is utilized to clarify the sources of impedance modulation during a variety of tasks, ranging from resisting transient loads to holding steady loads to making fast movements in unpredictable surroundings. It is shown that impedance modulation occurs automatically as a function of the specific operating ranges utilized during a given task by each of four different muscle-joint mechanical relations. The relative contribution of each relation depends on the type of task, with impedance during quasi-static conditions sensitive to muscle tension-length and sometimes joint parallel elastic properties and during dynamic tasks dominated by the series element and muscle force-velocity properties. Elimination of any of these causes a decrease in built-in biomechanical capabilities. These findings raise questions concerning past theories on stiffness-impedance modulation which appear to underestimate the role of inherent biomechanical properties.",1988,21,12,1011-25,10.1016/0021-9290(88)90248-5,#2954,Winters 1988,

Lung function tests, respiratory muscle evaluation and nocturnal gas exchange were obtained as part of routine evaluation. We included 52 consecutive children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (n = 20), spinal muscular atrophy (n = 10) and other NMD (n = 22). 20 patients had nocturnal hypoxaemia, defined as minimal arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (S(p,O(2))) <90% for ≥ 2% of night time, and 22 had nocturnal hypercapnia, defined as maximal transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (P(tc,CO(2))) >50 mmHg for ≥ 2% of night time. Forced vital capacity and helium functional residual capacity correlated with minimal nocturnal S(p,O(2)) (p = 0.009 and p = 0.01, respectively).

Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure correlated with minimal nocturnal S(p,O(2)) (p = 0.02). Daytime P(a,CO(2)) was a weak predictor of nocturnal hypercapnia (sensitivity 80%; specificity 57%).

284,2400908.0,Electrophysiologic changes accompanying Wallerian degeneration in frog sciatic nerve.,Brain Res,"The time course of the physiological changes accompanying Wallerian degeneration in the frog is markedly prolonged in comparison with that in mammals. Following transection of frog sciatic nerve, stimulation of the distal segment results in muscle contraction of normal amplitude through day 4, after which tension and EMG signals decline rapidly to levels that are undetectable by day 7. The compound action potential in the severed nerve continues for a much longer period of time, however, persisting as long as approximately 6 weeks. The amplitude remains at normal levels for nearly 3 weeks, after which it declines progressively, approaching zero at approximately 6 weeks. Conduction velocity remains normal in both alpha- and beta-fibers for approximately 3 weeks; thereafter, velocity in the alpha-fibers declines to approximately 71% of normal, and beta-fiber conduction is no longer detectable. Contraction could be elicited by direct stimulation of the muscle during the entire 6-week period of the study. The failure of nerve-mediated muscle activity in the face of persistent nerve conduction could be the result of either a defect in the most distal portions of the nerve fibers or a defect in neuromuscular transmission. These results suggest that EMG evaluation may be more sensitive than nerve conduction studies for clinical assessment of axonopathy at early stages.",1990,523,2,230-6,10.1016/0006-8993(90)91491-x,#2957,Levenson 1990,
285,29595993.0,Factors Predictive of Healing in Large Rotator Cuff Tears: Is It Possible to Predict Retear Preoperatively?,Am J Sports Med,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have identified risk factors that cause retear after rotator cuff repair. However, it is still questionable whether retears can be predicted preoperatively. PURPOSE: To determine the risk factors related to retear after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and to evaluate whether it is possible to predict the occurrence of retear preoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: This study enrolled 112 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with single-row technique for a large-sized tear, defined as a tear with a mediolateral length of 3 to 5 cm. All patients underwent routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9 months postoperatively to assess tendon integrity. The sample included 61 patients (54.5%) in the healed group and 51 (45.5%) in the retear group. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of retears were supraspinatus muscle atrophy ( P < .001) and fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus ( P = .027), which could be preoperatively measured by MRI. A significant difference was found between the two groups in sex, the acromiohumeral interval, tendon tension, and preoperative or intraoperative mediolateral tear length and musculotendinous junction position in univariate analysis. However, these variables were not independent predictors in multivariate analysis. The cutoff values of occupation ratio of supraspinatus and fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus were 43% and grade 2, respectively. The occupation ratio of supraspinatus <43% and grade ≥2 fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus were the strongest predictors of retear, with an area under the curve of 0.908, sensitivity of 98.0%, and specificity of 83.6% (accuracy = 90.2%). CONCLUSION: In patients with large rotator cuff tears, it was possible to predict the retear before rotator cuff repair regardless of intraoperative factors. The retear could be predicted most effectively when the occupation ratio of supraspinatus was <43% or the fatty infiltration of infraspinatus was grade ≥2. Predicting retear preoperatively may help surgeons determine proper treatment and predict the postoperative prognosis.",2018,46,7,1693-1700,10.1177/0363546518762386,#2958,Jeong 2018,arthroscopic rotator cuff repair

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Academic practice. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three subjects underwent genioglossus advancement with uvulopalatopharyngoplasty for OSA. Subjects underwent pre- and postoperative polysomnography, cephalometry, and subjective assessment questionnaires. Eighteen subjects completed the study. The tension force of the mandible and the bicortical width of the genial tubercle were measured and surgical response determined. RESULTS: Improvement in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was seen in 15 of 18 subjects (83.3%). Eleven subjects were classified as responders and 7 as nonresponders (61.1% success), with responders exhibiting a statistically significant reduction in mean delta AHI as compared with nonresponders: 28.3 ± 26.2 versus 2.0 ± 22.0 events per hour (95% confidence interval, 1.8-50.8; P = .037). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale improved from 13.2 ± 4.5 to 7.6 ± 3.4 (P = .002). There was no significant difference in body mass index, neck circumference, overall tension, or mandibular width between responders and nonresponders. However, there was a significant difference in the tension:width ratio between responders (53.9 ± 6.38 g/mm) and nonresponders (65.4 ± 11.2 g/mm; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-22.1; P = .036). CONCLUSION: This article describes a novel approach to determine the force applied to the genioglossus during advancement and its correlation to postoperative outcomes. The tension:width ratio may be an indicator for postoperative success and delta AHI improvement in OSA patients.",2016,154,3,558-63,10.1177/0194599815625210,#2959,Barrera 2016,AHI
287,30826819.0,Tongue Position Variability During Sustained Notes in Healthy vs Dystonic Horn Players Using Real-Time MRI.,Med Probl Perform Art,"OBJECTIVE: Embouchure dystonia (EmD) is a variant of focal task-specific dystonia in musicians characterized by the loss of control in facial and oral muscles while controlling airflow into the mouthpiece of a wind or brass instrument. We compared tongue position variability (TPV) during sustained notes between healthy, elite horn players and horn players affected by EmD. METHODS: Real-time MRI films at 33.3 ms resolution were obtained from 8 healthy elite and 5 EmD horn players as they performed on a non-ferromagnetic horn at each of three different dynamic levels: pianissimo, mezzo forte, and fortissimo. Nine profile lines (3 from anterior, 3 from middle, and 3 from posterior oral cavity regions) were overlaid on each image using a customized MATLAB toolkit, and the variability of the dorsal tongue edge position was examined at each dynamic from temporal intensity profiles produced by MATLAB. RESULTS: Despite trends for more pronounced TPV (larger standard deviations) in the elite musicians (p=0.062), 2-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant differences between groups. However, dynamic level significantly influenced TPV for all subjects, combined (p=0.048) and different regions of the oral cavity showed differing TPV (p<0.001). When only the most active region (anterior oral cavity) was included in the model, differences between groups reached statistical significance (elite > EmD, p<0.048), particularly at the fortissimo dynamic. We postulate that these differences may be due, in part, to a greater degree of generalized orofacial muscle tension in the EmD subjects that includes the tongue.",2019,34,1,33-38,10.21091/mppa.2019.1007,#2960,Iltis 2019,

Previous studies indicate that both intramuscular pressure (IMP) and electromyography (EMG) correlate linearly with muscle contraction force during isometric exercise. The objective of this study was to compare IMP and EMG as linear assessors of muscle contraction force during dynamic exercise. IMP and surface EMG activity were recorded during concentric and eccentric isokinetic plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the ankle joint from the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles of nine male volunteers (28-54 yr). Ankle torque was measured using a dynamometer, and IMP was measured via catheterization. IMP exhibited better linear correlation than EMG with ankle joint torque during concentric contractions of the SOL (IMP R2 = 0.97, EMG R2 = 0.81) and the TA (IMP R2 = 0.97, EMG R2 = 0.90), as well as during eccentric contractions (SOL: IMP R2 = 0.91, EMG R2 = 0.51; TA: IMP R2 = 0.94, EMG R2 = 0.73). IMP provides a better index of muscle contraction force than EMG during concentric and eccentric exercise through the entire range of torque. IMP reflects intrinsic mechanical properties of individual muscles, such as length-tension relationships, which EMG is unable to assess.",1993,74,6,2634-40,10.1152/jappl.1993.74.6.2634,#2961,Aratow 1993,NASA Center ARC
289,22582887.0,A description of the lumbar interfascial triangle and its relation with the lateral raphe: anatomical constituents of load transfer through the lateral margin of the thoracolumbar fascia.,J Anat,"Movement and stability of the lumbosacral region is contingent on the balance of forces distributed through the myofascial planes associated with the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF). This structure is located at the common intersection of several extremity muscles (e.g. latissimus dorsi and gluteus maximus), as well as hypaxial (e.g. ventral trunk muscles) and epaxial (paraspinal) muscles. The mechanical properties of the fascial constituents establish the parameters guiding the dynamic interaction of muscle groups that stabilize the lumbosacral spine. Understanding the construction of this complex myofascial junction is fundamental to biomechanical analysis and implementation of effective rehabilitation in individuals with low back and pelvic girdle pain. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to describe the anatomy of the lateral margin of the TLF, and specifically the interface between the fascial sheath surrounding the paraspinal muscles and the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis (TA) and internal oblique (IO) muscles. The lateral margin of the TLF was exposed via serial reduction dissections from anterior and posterior approaches. Axial sections (cadaveric and magnetic resonance imaging) were examined to characterize the region between the TA and IO aponeurosis and the paraspinal muscles. It is confirmed that the paraspinal muscles are enveloped by a continuous paraspinal retinacular sheath (PRS), formed by the deep lamina of the posterior layer of the TLF. The PRS extends from the spinous process to transverse process, and is distinct from both the superficial lamina of the posterior layer and middle layer of the TLF. As the aponeurosis approaches the lateral border of the PRS, it appears to separate into two distinct laminae, which join the anterior and posterior walls of the PRS. This configuration creates a previously undescribed fat-filled lumbar interfascial triangle situated along the lateral border of the paraspinal muscles from the 12th rib to the iliac crest. This triangle results in the unification of different fascial sheaths along the lateral border of the TLF, creating a ridged-union of dense connective tissue that has been termed the lateral raphe (Spine, 9,1984, 163). This triangle may function in the distribution of laterally mediated tension to balance different viscoelastic moduli, along either the middle or posterior layers of the TLF.",2012,221,6,568-76,10.1111/j.1469-7580.2012.01517.x,#2962,Schuenke 2012,

Neurotensin-immunoreactive fibers occurred at blood vessels and in contact with smooth muscle cells of the muscular stratum. In vitro experiments with helical strips of the myometrium revealed dose-dependent excitatory actions of neurotensin on resting tension as well as on amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions.

Utilizing the novel camera system aims to improve neck posture, reduce neck muscle tension and thereby minimize the risk of neck pain. METHODS: Camera and lens systems were compared by assessing the craniovertebral angle (CVA), electromyographic activity of the M.trapezius and perceived exertion. 16 healthy participants (n = 8 female, 24 ± 2 years; n = 8 male, 30 ± 5 years) performed manual precision tasks in a cross-over design using both systems in sitting and standing positions. RESULTS: Analyses showed that using the camera system improved the CVA in sitting [28.4° (22.8°-33.9°) to 42.5° (38.9°-46.1°); p < 0.01] and decreased the M.trapezius activity in standing [13.1% (7.7%-18.6%) to 8.65% (5.49%-11.81%)]. Additionally, overall and neck specific perceived exertion decreased when using the camera system in standing.

This study measured active and passive tension in the long head of biceps in the 2 positions of the O'Brien test to validate the proposed anatomic basis of the test. Active tension was measured using surface electromyography of the long head of biceps in 12 healthy young adults. Passive tension was measured using a load cell attached to the intracapsular tendon of the long head of biceps in 5 cadaver specimens. Active and passive tension were higher in the negative position, thus refuting the proposed anatomic basis of the test. Although there may be an alternative basis for the test, the failure to support the proposed anatomic basis may partly explain the variable likelihood ratios obtained in clinical accuracy studies of the O'Brien test.

Eighteen menopausal women with SI who either were or were not taking estrogen/progestin replacement therapy and 14 fertile women with SI who either were or were not taking contraceptives were enrolled in the study. Biopsies from the suburethral anterior vaginal wall were obtained at tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) operation. Monoclonal antibody to ER-alpha and polyclonal antibody to ER-beta were used to stain frozen sections of vaginal tissue. The receptor expressions were scored based on percentage of positive cells. ER-alpha was detected in vaginal epithelial, stromal and smooth muscle cells. In menopausal SI women ER-alpha was detected significantly more frequently in the vaginal walls of estrogen/progestin-treated patients than in those who were untreated. Fertile SI women had significantly higher expression of ER-alpha than menopausal SI women. ER-alpha was not observed in vaginal blood vessels. ER-beta was detected in epithelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of the vagina. No significant difference in ER-beta expression was observed between different groups of patients. The expression of ER-alpha was not correlated with that of ER-beta. Both ER-alpha and -beta were detected, indicating a potential role for both types of estrogen receptor in the human vaginal wall. The expression of ER-alpha, but not of ER-beta, in menopausal SI women was regulated by estrogen/progestin replacement therapy. The presence of ER-beta in vaginal vascular smooth muscle cells raises the possibility of vascular effects of estrogen on the human vaginal wall.",2003,14,4,276-81; discussion 281,10.1007/s00192-003-1042-7,#2967,Fu 2003,
294,19159375.0,Measurement of skin stretch using digital image speckle correlation.,Skin Res Technol,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The surface of the skin is covered by intersecting grooves and ridges which produce characteristic skin surface patterns. It has been suggested that these folds provide a reserve of tissue, allowing the skin to stretch during normal muscle movements. More so, skin is anisotropic and under constant tension. Therefore, to characterize skin displacement following stretch, a discrete, description of the in-plane skin displacement during stretch is of interest. We introduce the use of digital image speckle correlation (DISC), a non-contact technique, to map, in two dimensions, the surface deformation patterns resulting from skin stretching. METHODS: We analyze skin stretch under the mechanical action of a film former applied on a defined square surface on the back of the hand. This is achieved by taking a series of images, during the drying process of the film former. The images are then analyzed with DISC to create vector diagram and projection maps, from which we can obtain spatially resolved information regarding the skin displacement. RESULTS: We first show that DISC can provide spatially resolved information at any time point during the drying process: areas of de-wetting, wetting were identified using projection maps; we then extracted the value of the drying time. Finally using a vector map, we show the orientation of the skin displacement during stretching and calculated the magnitude of the total stretch. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown previously that DISC can be used to determine skin mechanical properties and muscular activity. We show here that DISC, as a non-contact technique, can map, in two dimensions, the surface deformation patterns of a polymer solution on a substrate at any time point during the drying process. DISC analysis generates for each speckle of the sample analyzed, the orientation and magnitude of displacement of the polymer solution. DISC can map in two dimensions the deformation undergone by the substrate and skin stretch is measured in this particular case. We therefore show that the DISC method, as a non-contact technique has great potential for characterization of film formation and is a potential clinical research tool for the measurement of epidermis stretch and epidermis properties.",2008,14,3,298-303,10.1111/j.1600-0846.2008.00294.x,#2968,Staloff 2008,
295,19433346.0,"The other mechanism of muscular referred pain: the ""connective tissue"" theory.",Med Hypotheses,"Muscular referred pain, that is, pain perceived in a somatic area other than the site of the noxious stimulation, takes place on a specific place to each muscle in constant and predictable pattern. The central hyperexcitability theory focused on spinal cord, the most proper theory at present, can explain well the segmental pattern of referred pain showing delayed onset. But it is hard to explain the non segmental pattern of referred pain areas of superficial-seated or limb girdle and limb muscles. Referred pain areas of limb girdle and limb muscles appear on the skin above a belt of synergistic muscles beyond the segmental areas. In the case of forearm and calf muscles, referred pain shows up on the palm and sole, the point of force application to the outer object. This finding reflects biomechanical relationship between muscle and its referred pain area. From the phylogenetic perspective, aquatic vertebrated animals (e.g. fish) use myoseptum surrounding myomere, connected to skin to keep tensile strength with it for effective swimming. Likewise, in terrestrial vertebrated animals, there are skin parts weakly interconnected with muscles, though the tensile property of nearly all the skin devolutes except the points of action with the outside. These points are dynamic maximal skin tension areas connected with muscles through superficial fascia, in other words, referred pain areas. Referred pain of deep-seated or truncal muscles appears on the trunk segmentally via spinal cord (the central hyperexcitability theory), but superficial-seated or limb girdle and limb muscles elicit referred pain on dynamic maximal skin tension area through connective tissue (the ""connective tissue"" theory).",2009,73,3,292-5,10.1016/j.mehy.2009.02.040,#2969,Han 2009,

To maximize the utility of this test, examiners need the availability of ideal test settings and reliable norms. We conducted a prospective study of 8 subjects with no history of neurotologic symptoms to examine the test-retest consistency of VEMP testing and to analyze the impact of stimulus type and muscle tension monitoring. All subjects underwent VEMP testing with two stimuli: a 500-Hz tone and a click. With each stimulus, testing was completed with and without monitoring of sternocleidomastoid muscle tension. All subjects participated in an initial testing session and then returned for a repeat testing session 2 to 4 weeks later. We measured the amplitude of primary waveforms P13 (first positive peak) and N23 (first negative peak) and analyzed the reliability and reproducibility of the mean amplitude asymmetry of these VEMP peaks. The P13 component of the VEMP (specificity: 86.25%) demonstrated a more stable amplitude than did the N23 component (specificity: 70.50%). Therefore, our statistical analysis of the effect of stimulus type and muscle tension monitoring on test-retest reliability was limited to the P13 waveform. We found that neither the type of stimulus nor the presence or absence of muscle tension monitoring had any statistically significant effect on amplitude asymmetry. We concluded that in VEMP testing, the P13 component was more specific than the N23 component in identifying normal subjects and that the P13 component provided consistent results across test sessions, regardless of the type of stimulus or the presence or absence of muscle tension monitoring.",2010,89,4,170-6,,#2970,Bush 2010,

298,27025707.0,The effect of deltoid lengthening on functional outcome for reverse shoulder arthroplasty.,Musculoskelet Surg,"PURPOSE: Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) is based on the biomechanical advantages of lengthening the deltoid while medializing its center of rotation (COR). Little evidence exists describing the clinical benefits of these biomechanical advantages. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between deltoid lengthening and medialization of the COR with functional outcomes for RSA patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with primary RSA. Radiographic measurements of deltoid length and COR, assessment of forward elevation (FE) and external rotation (ER), and functional outcome scores were obtained pre- and postoperatively. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between these radiographic measurements and changes in shoulder functionality. RESULTS: On average, patients improved significantly in function and functional outcome scores. Postoperative COR correlated weakly with postoperative FE. There were weakly negative correlations between increase in acromion to greater tuberosity distance and postoperative FE, and between deltoid lengthening and FE improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that deltoid lengthening does not correlate with improvements in active FE or ER. These findings could indicate that change in deltoid length is less important than previously thought. Furthermore, the negative correlations seen could indicate that there is over-tensioning of the deltoid in specific cases. Further studies are needed to better assess the role of deltoid length and other factors that may impact RSA outcomes.",2016,100,2,127-32,10.1007/s12306-016-0400-9,#2972,Sabesan 2016,Center of rotation
299,15689757.0,Task specificity in adductor spasmodic dysphonia versus muscle tension dysphonia.,Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) has been characterized as a ""task specific"" laryngeal dystonia, meaning that the severity of dysphonia varies depending on the demands of the vocal task. Voice produced in connected speech as compared with sustained vowels is said to provoke more frequent and severe laryngeal spasms. This study examined the diagnostic value of ""task specificity"" as a marker of ADSD and its potential to differentiate ADSD from muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), a functional voice disorder that can often masquerade as ADSD. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Five listeners, blinded to the purpose of the study, used a 10 cm visual analogue scale to rate dysphonia severity of subjects with ADSD (n = 36) and MTD (n = 45) producing either connected speech or a sustained vowel ""ah."" RESULTS: In ADSD, dysphonia severity for connected speech (M = 6.22 cm, SD = 2.56) was rated significantly more severe than sustained vowel productions (M = 4.8 cm, SD = 2.8 [t (35) = 3.67, P < .001]). In MTD, however, no significant difference in severity was observed for the connected speech sample (M = 5.98 cm, SD = 2.83 versus the sustained vowel M = 5.86 cm, SD = 2.87 [t (44) = 0.378, P = .707]). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, an index of the accuracy of task specificity as a diagnostic marker, revealed that a 1 cm difference criterion correctly identified 53% of ADSD cases (sensitivity) and 76% of MTD cases (specificity) (chi2 (1) = 6.88, P = .0087). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced dysphonia severity during sustained vowels supports task specificity in ADSD but not MTD and highlights a valuable diagnostic marker whose recognition should contribute to improved diagnostic precision.",2005,115,2,311-6,10.1097/01.mlg.0000154739.48314.ee,#2973,Roy 2005,

EMG data were collected both in the workplace (indicating vocational muscle activity) and in a laboratory setting (indicating non-specific muscle activity). Women in manual (15 pairs) and office (24 pairs) work were included. The pairs were matched on age, gender and on current and historical work load, such as working hours, type and length of employment. Previous reports of this study have indicated that shoulder and neck myalgia was associated with increased muscle activity for the manual workers, and with psychological and psychosocial factors for the office workers. These risk factors were in the present report used as the basis for studying associations and interactions between muscle activity (1), psychological and psychosocial factors (2), and shoulder and neck pain (3). Subjectively reported or perceived general tension, a stress symptom presumed related to psychosocial and psychological factors, was previously found to be the strongest and only variable separating cases and controls in both work groups. In this paper, no relationship was found between perceived general tension and EMG variables for the office workers. For the manual workers a strong interaction was found; perceived general tension correlated positively with EMG variables for the controls, and negatively with EMG variables for the cases. It is hypothesised that the feeling of general tension represents a physiological activation response that may or may not include muscle fibre activation. This implies that pain provoked by psychosocial stress factors may not be mediated through increased muscle activity.",1996,64,2,221-230,10.1016/0304-3959(95)00103-4,#2975,VasseljenOJr 1996,

The objective of this study was to quantitatively assess whether the biomechanical changes in the suboccipital triangle help explain the clinical manifestations of Forward Head Posture. Specifically, this study aimed to identify whether the Greater Occipital Nerve or C2 nerve root may be compressed in Forward Head Posture. Three-dimensional, specimen-specific computer models were rendered from thirteen cadaveric cervical spine specimens. The spines transitioned from neutral to Forward head posture while motion data was collected. This data was synced with the computer models to make precise measurements.

302,6834105.0,Electromyographic response to displacement of different forelimb joints in the squirrel monkey.,J Neurosci,"The electromyographic (EMG) reflex response evoked in muscles stretched by imposed angular joint displacement has previously been studied in a variety of muscles and species. In most muscles studied, the EMG response consists of an initial burst of activity at latencies comparable to tendon tap responses followed by one or more bursts of EMG activity occurring at latencies less than somatosensory reaction time. The longer latency bursts or peaks of activity have often been assumed to be of similar origin in functionally diverse muscles. The present experiments were performed to examine the EMG response to imposed joint displacement in several different muscles of the squirrel monkey forelimb. The EMG was studied in muscles stretched by elbow, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal joint extension. Early (M1) and long (M2) latency peaks of activity could be observed in the EMG responses of short head of biceps (SHB), flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), at latencies which are similar to those reported in other primate species allowing for differences in the size of the animals. The intervals between these peaks did not correspond to the period of oscillations in tension which occurred after the onset of the joint extension. The M2 peak consistently occurred later in SHB than in FCU and FDP. The M1 peak was smaller in distal than in proximal muscles and was frequently absent in FDP at resting levels of EMG activity. The ratio of M1 to M1 + M2 activity for different muscles revealed that proximal muscles had prominent early with less prominent long latency activity, whereas distal muscles had minimal early latency activity with prominent long latency activity. The onset of EMG activity approached tendon tap latencies in FCU at high base line EMG levels but in most cases occurred at approximately twice tendon tap latencies in FDP at high base line EMG levels. The results demonstrate the presence of significant differences between the EMG response to joint displacement in the proximal-distal series of forelimb flexors. Differences in the reflex response to joint displacement are discussed in view of twitch times and motor unit composition of the muscles studied.",1983,3,4,783-94,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.03-04-00783.1983,#2977,Lenz 1983,
303,3012329.0,Muscle membrane excitation and impulse propagation velocity are reduced during muscle fatigue.,Muscle Nerve,"In order to determine whether or not impulse propagation was impaired during muscle fatigue, evoked muscle compound potentials (MCP) and twitches were recorded, both before and after fatigue, from the first dorsal interosseus (FDI), adductor pollicis (AP), and anterior tibialis (AT) muscles following supramaximal ulnar and peroneal nerve stimulation, respectively. The muscles were fatigued by maintaining maximum voluntary isometric, index finger abduction, thumb adduction, or ankle dorsiflexion for 1-5 minutes. FDI was most markedly altered, with reduced MCP amplitude (mean 32%) and increased MCP duration (mean 47%) after only 1 minute. After fatigue of longer duration (3-5 minutes), there were corresponding reductions in both the MCP amplitudes and the twitch tensions recorded from both the FDI and ankle dorsiflexors. We conclude that (1) a reduction in both the level of excitation and impulse propagation velocity of muscle membranes occurs during muscle fatigue, and (2) the magnitude of this reduced membrane function and its contribution to the mechanisms underlying fatigue depend both on the duration and degree of fatigue, as well as on the intrinsic properties of the particular muscle.",1986,9,4,367-74,10.1002/mus.880090415,#2979,Milner-Brown 1986,
304,8842952.0,Sarcomere length changes after flexor carpi ulnaris to extensor digitorum communis tendon transfer.,J Hand Surg Am,"Sarcomere length was measured intraoperatively on five patients undergoing tendon transfer of the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) to the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) for radial nerve palsy. The most significant result was that the absolute sarcomere length and sarcomere length operating range of the FCU increased after transfer into the EDC (p < .001). Preoperatively, with the wrist fully extended and fingers flexed, FCU sarcomere length was 4.22 +/- .24 microns and decreased to 3.19 +/- .05 microns as the wrist was fully flexed. This represented an overall sarcomere length range of 1.03 microns. After the tendon transfer using standard recommended techniques, all sarcomere lengths were significantly longer (p < .001). Specifically, sarcomeres were 0.74 +/- .14 microns longer with the muscle in its fully lengthened position (4.96 +/- .43 microns with the wrist and digits flexed) and 0.31 +/- .16 microns longer with the FCU in the fully shortened position (3.50 +/- .06 microns with the wrist and digits extended). At these sarcomere lengths, the FCU muscle was predicted to develop relatively high force only during movement involving synergistic wrist flexion and finger extension. Under the conditions of the procedures performed, the transferred FCU muscle was predicted to produce maximum force over the range of about 30 degrees of wrist flexion and 0 degree of finger flexion to 70 degrees of wrist extension and 90 degrees of finger flexion. While this is acceptable, a more desirable result was predicted to occur if the muscle was transferred at a longer length. In this latter case, greater stretch of the FCU during transfer (increasing sarcomere length to about 5 microns) was predicted to improve the transfer. The more highly stretched FCU was predicted to result in maximum force as the wrist and fingers progressed from about 60 degrees of wrist extension and 0 degree of finger flexion to 80 degrees of wrist extension and 70 degrees of finger flexion. These results quantify the relationship between the passive tension chosen for transfer, sarcomere length, and the estimated active tension that can be generated by the muscle. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of using intraoperative laser diffraction during tendon transfer as a guide for optimal placement of the transferred muscle.",1996,21,4,612-8,10.1016/S0363-5023(96)80012-8,#2980,Lieber 1996,
305,6496558.0,Calcium and cardiovascular function. Intracellular calcium levels during contraction and relaxation of mammalian cardiac and vascular smooth muscle as detected with aequorin.,Am J Med,"Calcium ion (Ca++) plays a central role in excitation-contraction coupling of both cardiac and vascular smooth muscles and have important functional interactions with other cations, including sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Ca++ transients associated with contraction-relaxation cycles of the heart and vasculature can now be recorded directly by use of aequorin, a bioluminescent protein that emits light when it combines with Ca++. After microinjection or chemical loading of aequorin into the sarcoplasm, light output provides an index of intracellular [Ca++]. In cardiac muscle, intracellular Ca++ increases more quickly than tension and decreases toward basal levels by the time peak tension is reached. The calcium transients of working myocardium in both human subjects and other mammalian species appear to be dominated by the release and uptake of Ca++ from intracellular stores under all conditions studied. Drugs and disease states produce marked changes in the amplitude and time course of the Ca++ transient and the corresponding contractile response. In vascular smooth muscle, there are stimulus-specific patterns in intracellular Ca++ associated with tonic contractions. Although Ca++ is related to tension development, the relationship appears to be more complex than that in cardiac muscle. As a result, tension development cannot be used as an index of free Ca++ levels in vascular smooth muscle. Selection of the most effective therapy to reverse a tonic contraction in states of spasm or hypertension may depend on the specific stimulus that caused the increased tone.",1984,77,5A,33-46,10.1016/s0002-9343(84)80006-6,#2981,Morgan 1984,
306,12679426.0,"Testosterone dose-dependently increases maximal voluntary strength and leg power, but does not affect fatigability or specific tension.",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"Testosterone supplementation in men increases fat-free mass, but whether measures of muscle performance, such as maximal voluntary strength, power, fatigability, or specific tension, are improved has not been determined. Furthermore, the extent to which these measures of muscle performance are related to testosterone dose or circulating concentration is unknown. To examine the relationship between testosterone dose and muscle performance, 61 healthy, eugonadal young men (aged 18-35 yr) were randomized to 1 of 5 groups, each receiving a long-acting GnRH agonist to suppress endogenous testosterone production plus weekly injections of 25, 50, 125, 300, or 600 mg testosterone enanthate for 20 wk. These doses produced mean nadir testosterone concentrations of 253, 306, 542, 1345, and 2370 ng/dl, respectively. Maximal voluntary muscle strength and fatigability were determined by a seated leg press exercise. Leg power was measured using a validated leg power instrument. Specific tension was estimated by the ratio of one repetition maximum muscle strength to thigh muscle volume determined by magnetic resonance imaging. Testosterone administration was associated with a dose-dependent increase in leg press strength and leg power, but muscle fatigability did not change significantly during treatment. Changes in leg press strength were significantly correlated with total (r = 0.46; P = 0.0005) and free (r = 0.38; P = 0.006) testosterone as was leg power (total testosterone: r = 0.38; P = 0.007; free testosterone: r = 0.35; P = 0.015), but not muscle fatigability. Serum IGF-I concentrations were not significantly correlated with leg strength, power, or fatigability. Specific tension did not change significantly at any dose. We conclude that the effects of testosterone on muscle performance are specific; it increases maximal voluntary strength and leg power, but does not affect fatigability or specific tension. The changes in leg strength and power are dependent on testosterone dose and circulating testosterone concentrations and exhibit a log-linear relationship with serum total and free testosterone. Failure to observe a significant testosterone dose relationship with fatigability suggests that testosterone does not affect this component of muscle performance and that different components of muscle performance are regulated by different mechanisms.",2003,88,4,1478-85,10.1210/jc.2002-021231,#2982,Storer 2003,
307,11903128.0,Concentric force enhancement during human movement.,Acta Physiol Scand,"In order to understand the possible mechanisms contributing to enhanced concentric performance in stretch-shortening cycle exercises in vivo the present study examined knee extension torque, electromyogram (EMG) activity and fascicle length of the vastus lateralis muscle in maximal and submaximal human movements. Maximal concentric knee extensions (120 degrees s(-1)) were done after pre-stretch and pre-isometric conditions by nine volunteers. During shortening at the knee angle of 115 degrees (180 degrees = extended) the knee extension torque was found to be greater in pre-stretch condition (272 vs. 248 N m, P < 0.05) although the torque level prior to shortening was smaller than in pre-isometric condition (268 vs. 314 N m, P < 0.05). At the moment of torque enhancement the EMG activity levels or fascicle lengths did not differ between the conditions. It is proposed that besides specific experimental conditions the present enhancement may be related to longer fascicle length prior to shortening (by 4.1 cm, P < 0.05) in pre-stretch condition and to modified length-tension properties. Fascicle length behaviour was found to play an important role also in unilateral, submaximal sledge-jump conditions where pre-loading was altered but the concentric net impulse and joint angular movements were the same. In repeated drop jumps with greater pre-load the changes in fascicle length were smaller than in the counter movement jump that was characterized by a lower force and activity level in the eccentric phase. Results from the present maximal and submaximal loading conditions suggest that the benefits of stretch-shortening cycle muscle function may come through different interactive mechanisms that may be task specific.",2001,173,4,369-77,10.1046/j.1365-201X.2001.00915.x,#2983,Finni 2001,
308,23652851.0,Thickening of the inferior glenohumeral capsule: an ultrasound sign for shoulder capsular contracture.,Eur Radiol,OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study was to measure the inferior glenohumeral capsule thickness of shoulders clinically affected by capsular contracture by comparison to the contralateral asymptomatic side. METHODS: Bilateral shoulder ultrasound (US) examinations of 20 patients with clinically or MRI proven unilateral capsular contracture were retrospectively assessed. Inferior capsule evaluation was performed with a transducer placed within the axilla in maximally abducted shoulders. Measurements were symmetrically performed orthogonally to the inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) in the axial plane; the coronal plane was used to ensure the tension of the IGHL. The significance of any difference in thickening was assessed with the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The average thickness was 4.0 mm in shoulders with capsular contracture vs. 1.3 mm in asymptomatic contralateral shoulders (P < 0.0001). Twenty per cent of patients with capsular contracture and inferior capsule thickness increase showed US features of other painful diseases of the rotator cuff. CONCLUSION: The thickness of the inferior capsule is measurable through ultrasound examination and appears to be increased in shoulders with capsular contracture. Exploration of the inferior aspect of the shoulder joint could be added to shoulder US examination protocols for capsular contracture assessment even if other rotator cuff abnormalities are diagnosed by US. KEY POINTS: • Ultrasound is increasingly used to diagnose shoulder problems. • The thickness of the inferior glenohumeral ligament is measurable in the axilla. • The inferior glenohumeral ligament appears thickened in shoulders with capsular contracture. • Capsular contracture ultrasound features can be associated with other rotator cuff problems.,2013,23,10,2802-6,10.1007/s00330-013-2874-2,#2984,Michelin 2013,
309,23668755.0,Factors contributing to the fatigue-related reduction in active dorsiflexion joint range of motion.,Appl Physiol Nutr Metab,"Reductions in active joint range of motion (ROM) are responsible for decreased work-generating capacity during fatiguing repetitive isotonic shortening contractions. Factors responsible for impairing the joint-angle-specific net torque developed during muscle shortening could include fatigue-induced torque loss, shortening-induced torque depression in the agonist muscle, and opposing passive tension of the antagonists, but these have not been systematically explored. Nine men (aged 25.8 ± 2.0 years) performed a maximal-effort fatiguing task that consisted of repetitive loaded shortening dorsiflexions through a 40° ankle joint ROM until active ROM decreased by 50%. Torque developed during contractile shortening, as well as passive opposing tension, was quantified before and after the reduction in active ROM. Before fatigue, and compared with maximum voluntary isometric contraction torque at the terminal ROM, shortening-induced torque depression in the agonist muscle and passive tension from the antagonists reduced net torque developed at the end of contractile shortening by ∼42% and ∼19%, respectively. After fatigue, a steepened ascending joint torque-angle relationship remained during contractile shortening, but neither muscle coactivation nor contractile slowing contributed to the fatigue-induced torque loss. Fatigue-induced torque loss, shortening-induced torque depression in the agonist, and passive tension in the antagonist greatly depressed net torque developed at the end of contractile shortening. These contributed to the fatigue-induced reduction in active ROM by impairing the ability of the dorsiflexors to generate sufficient torque to overcome the imposed load at the end of contractile shortening.",2013,38,5,490-7,10.1139/apnm-2012-0357,#2985,Cheng 2013,

We investigated the effect of eosinophils and eosinophil supernatants obtained from eight hypereosinophilic patients on the contractile performance and endocardial morphology of isolated, electrically stimulated cat papillary muscle preparations (n = 16). All these eosinophil suspensions contained high proportions of ""hypodense"" or ""activated"" cells. Eosinophils (5-15 x 10(6) ml organ bath) or eosinophil culture supernatants (prepared by overnight incubation at 37 degrees C) when added to papillary muscles produced acute changes in contractile behavior of these muscles identical to the previously reported effects of selective endocardial damage: a reduction in time to peak isometric twitch tension causing a reduction in peak isometric tension but with no significant reduction in rate of tension development or in maximum unloaded shortening velocity. All of these muscle preparations showed severely damaged endocardium at scanning electron microscopy. Addition of eosinophils from hypereosinophilic patients to muscles with selectively damaged endocardium (by previous transient [1-second] exposure to 1% Triton X-100) produced no further change in contractile performance. No significant change in contractile performance or endocardial morphology of papillary muscles (n = 16) was observed after addition of eosinophils (7.5-10 x 10(6] or neutrophils (8-15 x 10(6] from normal subjects or of cell-free culture medium.

The external rotation moment data were gathered from eight subjects in transverse and six subjects in sagittal plane using an isokinetic dynamometer. In the sagittal plane, all studied muscles presented larger estimated force in comparison with the transverse plane.

Our investigation also failed to demonstrate any electrically detectable muscle activity in muscles where the patients during the examination reported pain (paraspinal, trapezius and tibial anterior muscles).

314,17234797.0,Isoform switching in myofibrillar and excitation-contraction coupling proteins contributes to diminished contractile function in regenerating rat soleus muscle.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Postnatal development of skeletal muscle occurs through the progressive transformation of diverse biochemical, metabolic, morphological, and functional characteristics from the embryonic to the adult phenotype. Since muscle regeneration recapitulates postnatal development of muscle fiber, it offers an appropriate experimental model to investigate the existing relationships between diverse muscle functions and the expression of key protein isoforms, particularly at the single-fiber level. This study was carried out in regenerating soleus muscle 14 days after injury. At this intermediate stage, the regenerating muscle exhibited a recovery of mass greater than its force generation capacity. The lower specific tension of regenerating muscle suggested intrinsic defective excitation-contraction coupling and/or contractility processes. The presence of developmental isoforms of both the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (alpha(1)C) and of ryanodine receptor 3, paralleled by an abnormal caffeine contracture development, confirms the immature excitation-contraction coupling of the regenerating muscle. The defective Ca(2+) handling could also be confirmed by the lower sarcoplasmic reticulum caffeine sensitivity of regenerating single fibers. Also, regenerating single fibers revealed a lower maximal specific tension, which was associated with the residual presence of embryonic myosin heavy chains. Moreover, the fibers showed a reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity of myofibrillar proteins, particularly those simultaneously expressing the slow and fast isoforms of troponin C. The present results indicate that the expression of developmental proteins determines the incomplete functional recovery of regenerating soleus.",2007,102,4,1640-8,10.1152/japplphysiol.01397.2006,#2990,Esposito 2007,
315,3292068.0,Fitness evaluations and fitness findings in competitive junior tennis players.,Clin Sports Med,"Elite tennis players, as well as a large number of active recreational players, are involved in a sport that applies high repetitive loads that can create tension overload situations in certain key anatomic areas of the body and add to possible overload situations in other areas of the body. This results in patterns of inflexibility and weakness that can be demonstrated on a tennis-specific musculoskeletal exam, and that can be correlated with areas of increased injury occurrence. These players report conditioning programs that are, for the most part, inadequate to confer total conditioning of all the muscular parameters important in playing tennis. All of these factors, in addition to the frequency and type of playing, contribute to the occurrence of the overload injuries noted. These aspects need to be addressed in a preventative program for injury reduction. We do not believe that major changes in the way that tennis is played should be implemented until the effects of a proper preventative conditioning program are evaluated. The ""ideal"" conditioning program has not yet been found. While the exact composition of the program is in doubt, our studies allow us to recommend flexibility, strength, and endurance training for all athletes playing tennis at frequent intervals.

The present study investigated the rise rate and timing variability of surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of wrist flexor/extensor muscles in the WFD, and compared them with those in two control groups: non-drummers (NDs) and ordinary drummers (ODs). The WFD showed more rapid EMG amplitude rise, earlier decline of EMG activity, and more stable muscle activation time than the NDs and ODs. In addition, there was a significant correlation between the EMG rise rate and the duration of drum training in the group of drummers (i.e., ODs and WFD). These results indicate that the 10-Hz performance of the WFD was achieved by a 'sharper' and 'less noisy' burst pattern of wrist muscles, and that drum training would have the effect to increase the speed of development of muscle tension.",2012,22,1,60-6,10.1016/j.jelekin.2011.10.004,#2992,Fujii 2012,

This paper presents the application of a three-dimensional (3D) computational knee model for parametric studies of knee kinematics in response to simulated muscle loads. The knee model was constructed using the magnetic resonance images and biomechanical experimental data of the same cadaveric human knee specimen. The kinematics of the knee predicted by the computational model was compared with that measured from different specimens in a wide range of loading conditions and flexion angles. In general, the model predictions were within the range of experimental data. The model was then used to predict knee motion, ligament forces, and contact pressure in response to a simulated quadriceps force when the knee was ACL deficient. Partial ACL injury was simulated by reducing the stiffness of the ACL in the model. The results demonstrated that even with a reduction of 75% of the ACL stiffness, the ACL still carried a significant amount of the load (more than 58%) carried by an intact ACL. The kinematics (both tibial translation and rotation) varied less than 20% compared to that of the knee with intact ACL. The 3D computational model can be a powerful tool to simulate different variables that would influence knee function after ACL reconstruction, such as the initial tension of the ACL graft, the insertion sites of the graft, multibundle grafts, graft materials, and various physiological loading conditions.",2002,30,5,713-20,10.1114/1.1484219,#2993,Li 2002,
318,24687444.0,An EMG study of the lip muscles during covert auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia.,J Speech Lang Hear Res,"PURPOSE: Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are speech perceptions in the absence of external stimulation. According to an influential theoretical account of AVHs in schizophrenia, a deficit in inner-speech monitoring may cause the patients' verbal thoughts to be perceived as external voices. The account is based on a predictive control model, in which individuals implement verbal self-monitoring. The authors examined lip muscle activity during AVHs in patients with schizophrenia to check whether inner speech occurred. METHOD: Lip muscle activity was recorded during covert AVHs (without articulation) and rest. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used on 11 patients with schizophrenia. RESULTS: Results showed an increase in EMG activity in the orbicularis oris inferior muscle during covert AVHs relative to rest. This increase was not due to general muscular tension because there was no increase of muscular activity in the forearm muscle. CONCLUSION: This evidence that AVHs might be self-generated inner speech is discussed in the framework of a predictive control model. Further work is needed to better describe how inner speech is controlled and monitored and the nature of inner-speech-monitoring-dysfunction. This will lead to a better understanding of how AVHs occur.",2013,56,6,S1882-93,10.1044/1092-4388(2013/12-0210),#2994,Rapin 2013,

ET-1 caused concentration-dependent contractions that developed about 100% of the 70 mM KCl-induced tension in the younger dogs; those from older dogs did not generate more than 20%. In contrast, 5-HT developed only about 20% of the KCl-induced tension in rings from young dogs, whereas in the older animals, it developed up to 120% of the KCl tension. No significant difference in the tension developed by 70 mM KCl was noted between both groups of dogs. Mechanical denudation of the endothelial cell layer caused a modest, yet significant, leftward shift of the ET-1 and 5-HT concentration-response curves only in the younger dogs. N omega-Nitro-L-arginine (15 microM) shifted the ET-1 concentration-response curves to the left in rings from both groups of dogs. Rings precontracted with 20 mM KCl relaxed in a concentration-dependent fashion with acetylcholine; its sensitivity was about threefold less in the older group of dogs. To validate the changes in vascular reactivity with age, a parallel study was performed perfusing the arterial mesenteric bed of rats of 3, 7, and 30 weeks of age. In this experimental model, the efficacy of ET-1 significantly decreased with age and that of 5-HT was significantly increased.

Sputum, blood, breath and urinary biomarkers have all been investigated. We measured maximum respiratory pressure post exacerbation once the patient was compliant with the test and after 6 weeks, to assess any correlations. METHODS AND RESULTS: The maximum pressures were measured using a closed circuit spirometer with a clean rubber mouthpiece properly placed with the patients lips sealed around it. Patients were properly instructed to exhale slowly and completely, then inspire with maximum possible effort and advised to keep it for nearly 1.5 s for maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). For maximum expiratory pressures (MEP) patients were instructed to inspire slowly and completely, then expire forcefully with maximum effort. With the recorded values TTI (time tension index) was calculated. This was repeated again after 6 weeks. Using Pearsons correlation coefficient we found that MIP had a negative correlation with TTI and a positive correlation with FEV1. FEV1 had a positive correlation with FVC. MEP showed no significant correlation with TTI, but a positive correlation with FEV1. CONCLUSION: Acute exacerbations of COPD has a profound effect on the respiratory musculature especially the expiratory muscles but the maximum pressures are not specific enough to be prognostic markers. It might be worthwhile studying transformations of the respiratory musculature at the molecular level. More studies must be conducted to find a specific marker to aid in the management of the condition.",2012,156,4,302-11,10.5507/bp.2012.050,#2998,Vimal 2012,
322,10521646.0,Identification of optimal strategies for increasing whole arm strength using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multipliers.,"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a computer model for identifying muscles critical to improving functional upper extremity strength. DESIGN: A three-dimensional biomechanical model of the upper extremity was developed, and the predictions were compared to maximal arm strength data collected from healthy volunteers. BACKGROUND: Although several optimization-based mathematical models of the shoulder have been developed, none have utilized the mathematical properties of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multipliers to efficiently estimate the effect of strengthening individual muscles on functional strength of the whole arm. METHODS: A static three-dimensional biomechanical model of the glenohumeral, radio-humeral, ulno-humeral and wrist joints was developed for predicting maximal hand exertion forces. The model was formulated as a linear program. Constraints consisted of moment equilibrium conditions and limits on maximum and minimum allowable muscle forces. Predicted arm strengths were compared to maximal pull strength measurements made on 10 subjects (5 male; 5 female). The task involved pulling toward the mid-sagittal plane of the body with the arm flexed 45 degrees. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker variables associated with the maximal limits on muscle force were computed to estimate the effect of altering the strength of individual muscles on functional arm strength. RESULTS: Maximum pull strengths were predicted well by the model. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker values ranged from 0 (for muscles not at their upper force limits) to 0.11 for the flexor carpi radialis and pectoralis major muscles. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multipliers were found to be insensitive to the assumed specific tension of muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Upper extremity strength can be predicted from musculoskeletal geometry and physiology using linear programming. RELEVANCE: Karush-Kuhn-Tucker multipliers associated with the muscle force upper limits give insight into the effect of strengthening individual muscles on whole arm exertion strength. Such an analysis may provide insight into the development of optimal rehabilitation protocols.",1999,14,9,628-34,10.1016/s0268-0033(99)00022-4,#2999,Hughes 1999,
323,7737867.0,Specificity and sensitivity of temporalis ES2 measurements in the diagnosis of chronic primary headaches.,Headache,"We have evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of temporalis ES2 measurements for the diagnosis of primary headaches. Ninety-four outpatients diagnosed according to IHS criteria were prospectively included: 25 had chronic tension-type headache (code 2.2.), 15 episodic tension-type headache (code 2.1.), 20 migraine without aura (code 1.1.) and 34 chronic daily headaches with daily analgesics/ergotamine abuse (code 8.2.). In chronic tension-type, the sensitivity of the ES2 test was 84% at the 0.1 and the 0.5 Hz, but only 56% at the 2Hz stimulation rates. Its specificity was 100% at 0.1Hz, 90% at 0.5Hz and 95% at 2Hz compared to migraine; positive predictive values were at similar levels. Sensitivity of ES2 at 0.1 Hz was 67% in episodic tension-type headache, but its positive predictive value versus migraine was excellent. Comparing chronic tension-type headache and analgesic abusers, the specificity and positive predictive value of the ES2 test for diagnosing chronic tension-type headache were less satisfactory (60%) while the negative predictive values, however, remained good (83% at 0.1Hz). The results confirm that the temporalis ES2 test has a higher diagnostic sensitivity in chronic and episodic tension-type headache, but that it has a high negative predictive value for both types of tension-type headache compared to other primary headaches. For diagnostic purposes, the 0.1Hz stimulation rate seems optimal. The 2Hz stimulation rate is the least sensitive, although it may induce total disappearance of ES2 in up to 40% of patients. ES2 is of limited usefulness for separating chronic tension-type headache and chronic drug-abuse headache, possibly because the latter group comprises both tension-type headache and migraine patients.",1995,35,2,85-8,10.1111/j.1526-4610.1995.hed3502085.x,#3000,Wang 1995,
324,25258713.0,Electromyographic assessment of functional symmetry of paraspinal muscles during static exercises in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis.,Biomed Res Int,"BACKGROUND: The question of how to correct and rehabilitate scoliosis remains one of the most difficult problems of orthopaedics. Controversies continue to arise regarding various types of both symmetric and asymmetric scoliosis-specific therapeutic exercises. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present paper was to conduct an electromyographic assessment of functional symmetry of paraspinal muscles during symmetric and asymmetric exercises in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a group of 82 girls, mean age 12.4 ± 2.3 years with single- or double-major-idiopathic scoliosis, Cobb angle 24 ± 9.4°. The functional biopotentials during isometric work of paraspinal muscles in ""at rest"" position and during two symmetric and four asymmetric exercises were measured with the use of the Muscle Tester ME 6000 electromyograph. RESULTS: In general, asymmetric exercises were characterised by larger differences in bioelectrical activity of paraspinal muscles, in comparison with symmetric exercises, both in the groups of patients with single-curve and double-curve scoliosis. CONCLUSION: During symmetric and asymmetric exercises, muscle tension patterns differed significantly in both groups, in comparison with the examination at rest, in most cases generating positive corrective patterns. Asymmetric exercises generated divergent muscle tension patterns on the convex and concave sides of the deformity.",2014,2014,,573276,10.1155/2014/573276,#3001,ChwaÅa 2014,
325,836469.0,The sympathetic innervation and adrenoreceptor function of the human lower urinary tract in the normal state and after parasympathetic denervation.,Invest Urol,"Adrenergic innervation of the human urinary bladder was studied in vitro in specimens excised during operation from six neurologically normal bladders and from five parasympathetically denervated (lower motor neuron lesion) bladders. Using a specific histochemical fluorescence technique, it was found that the adrenergic nerve terminals of the detrusor of the patients with lower motor neuron lesions were thicker, had a stronger fluorescence intensity, and were in most cases also more densely distributed than those of any of the six neurologically normal bladders examined. By recording the changes in the isometric tension of detrusor strips after different pharmacologic treatments, the existence of alpha-adrenergic receptors could be demonstrated in the parasympathetically denervated detrusor but not in the normal detrusor. The influence of alpha-adrenolytic treatment (phenoxybenzamine) was studied in vivo in seven patients with lower motor neuron lesions. In the cystometrograms, the bladders were more hypotonic and the ""autonomous waves"" appeared at a higher level of filling or were totally extinguished after this pharmacologic treatment. With an isotonic volume registration method, a bladder volume increase was recorded after alpha-adrenergic blockade. Using sphincterometry or urethral pressure profile studies, a decrease in the urethral resistance was observed after alpha-adrenolytic treatment.",1977,14,4,322-8,,#3002,Sundin 1977,
326,1729931.0,Prediction of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in low-risk subjects. An epidemiologic investigation of caffeine halothane contracture responses. The North American Malignant Hyperthermia Registry.,Anesthesiology,"The most commonly used laboratory test for predicting malignant hyperthermia susceptibility is the caffeine halothane contracture test. However, the specificity and sensitivity of proposed North American diagnostic guidelines for this test have never been evaluated in a large, human study population. Therefore, the authors conducted a multiinstitutional, prospective study of skeletal muscle contracture responses in a subject population at low risk for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility to help determine the specificity of the proposed guidelines. Subjects were selected arbitrarily from a population of patients undergoing surgery unrelated to performance of a diagnostic muscle biopsy. Subjects were admitted to this study and were presumed nonsusceptible if there was no evidence of any of the following malignant hyperthermia risk factors: prior abnormal response to triggering anesthetic agents, myopathy, or family history of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The authors suggested rejection of the proposed diagnostic guidelines if an 85% specificity estimate among subjects could not be obtained. The authors analyzed the responses of 1,022 muscle fascicles, derived from 176 subjects, to the following: 1) separate administration of 3% halothane or incremental caffeine concentrations, or 2) the joint administration of 1% halothane and incremental caffeine concentrations. The following contracture results were obtained. First, for individual fascicles, 9.2% exceeded a greater than 0.7 g threshold for 3% halothane, 15.2% exceeded a greater than or equal to 0.2 g threshold for 2 mM caffeine, 32.4% exceeded a 1-g increase for less than 4 mM caffeine, 2.6% had a greater than 7% maximal increase in tension at 2 mM caffeine, and 63.5% had a ""halothane caffeine-specific concentration"" at less than or equal to 1 mM caffeine. Second, the percentages of subjects with 1 or more fascicles exceeding the proposed threshold were as follows: 45.8% for the four-component, 28.8% for the three-component, and 32.7% for the two-component contracture test. Third, the percentages of subjects with 1 or more fascicles exceeding the proposed threshold for both halothane and caffeine were as follows: 9.5% for 3% halothane and 2 mM caffeine, 2.0% for 3% halothane and 7% maximal increase in tension at 2 mM caffeine, and 11.0% for 1% halothane and 2 mM caffeine. Fourth, center-to-center differences were the major source of variation in the rate that subjects exceeded proposed thresholds. These data demonstrate that proposed diagnostic guidelines must be modified to improve specificity estimates before adoption by diagnostic centers.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1992,76,1,16-27,10.1097/00000542-199201000-00003,#3003,Larach 1992,

329,9807664.0,A new method for combined isometric and isobaric pharmacodynamic studies on porcine coronary arteries.,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,"1. The principal aim of the present study was to explore the isometric and isobaric capacity of a new intravascular technique, impedance planimetry, in basic pharmacodynamic investigations on porcine isolated epicardial coronary arteries. 2. The balloon-based catheter technique provides simultaneous measurements of luminal cross-sectional area and pressure. Sources of errors that may influence the accuracy of measurements were evaluated in detail. 3. Under isometric conditions, the stretch ratio-tension diagram showed typical developments of resting and active tensions of the smooth muscle when exposed to alternating maximal K+ depolarization and mechanical stretching. The mean (+/- SEM) maximum active tension was 28.43 +/- 1.72 mN/mm, which was reached at a stretch ratio of 1.26 +/- 0.02, corresponding to a resting tension of 10.50 +/- 0.53 mN/mm (n = 7). The concentration-response relationship to K+ at optimal basal tension was characterized by a mean (+/- SEM) pD2 value of 1.67 +/- 0.01 (n = 7). 4. Under isobaric conditions in the pressure range 40-140 mmHg, the method allowed the investigation of active vascular responses to partial K+ depolarization. The maximal active response to 25 mmol/L K+ was found at the transmural pressure of 60 mmHg (n = 7). To obtain full K+ concentration-response curves, a basal tension corresponding to a transmural pressure of 120 mmHg was required. The mean (+/- SEM) pD2 value for the concentration-response relationship to K+ was 1.53 +/- 0.01 (n = 10). 5. The vascular sensitivities to cumulatively added K+ and various agonists, such as acetylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine and noradrenaline, obtained from the same vessel segment at the same initial conditions corresponding to 120 mmHg were significantly higher with the isometric than with the isobaric approach. 6.

330,16884559.0,Intracellular mechanism of the negative inotropic effect induced by alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation in mouse myocardium.,J Physiol Sci,"Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation (alpha(1)ARS) shows a positive inotropic effect in most mammalian myocardium. In mouse myocardium, however, alpha(1)ARS showed the negative inotropic effect, of which intracellular mechanisms are not fully clarified. The purpose of this study is to investigate the intracellular mechanism of the negative inotropic effect by alpha(1)ARS in C57BL/6 mouse myocardium. We used isolated ventricular papillary muscles of C57BL/6 strain mouse which is widely used for genetic manipulation. We simultaneously measured isometric tension and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) using the aequorin method. In twitch contraction, phenylephrine concentration-dependently (1-100 microM) decreased tension without significant changes in the Ca(2+) transient, and these effects were completely blocked by prazosin (3 microM) or calphostin C (a PKC inhibitor, 1 microM). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (a PKC activator, 1 microM) decreased tension as observed in phenylephrine. After PMA application, the negative inotropic effect of phenylephrine disappeared. To estimate the Ca(2+) sensitivity, tetanic contraction was produced, and the relation between [Ca(2+)](i) and tension at a steady state was measured. Phenylephrine (10 microM) decreased the Ca(2+) sensitivity, and PMA showed a similar Ca(2+) desensitizing effect. These results suggest that the negative inotropic effect of phenylephrine in mouse myocardium can be explained by the decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity through the activation of PKC. The present result indicates that the effect of alpha(1)ARS differs among species and strains of experiment animals. Thus, we should be careful about using the results of mouse myocardium to understand the functions of the human heart.",2006,56,4,297-304,10.2170/physiolsci.RP007306,#3007,Hirano 2006,

332,19684295.0,Electromechanical delay of the knee flexor muscles is impaired after harvesting hamstring tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,Am J Sports Med,"BACKGROUND: Changes in electromechanical delay during muscle activation are expected when there are substantial alterations in the structural properties of the musculotendinous tissue. In anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, specific tendons are being harvested for grafts. Thus, there is an associated scar tissue development at the tendon that may affect the corresponding electromechanical delay. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate whether harvesting of semitendinosus and gracilis tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction will affect the electromechanical delay of the knee flexors. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The authors evaluated 12 patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with a semitendinosus and gracilis autograft, 2 years after the reconstruction, and 12 healthy controls. Each participant performed 4 maximally explosive isometric contractions with a 1-minute break between contractions. The surface electromyographic activity of the biceps femoris and the semitendinosus was recorded from both legs during the contractions. RESULTS: The statistical comparisons revealed significant increases of the electromechanical delay of the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knee for both investigated muscles. Specifically, the electromechanical delay values were increased for both the biceps femoris (P = .029) and the semitendinosus (P = .005) of the reconstructed knee when compared with the intact knee. Comparing the anterior cruciate ligament-reconstructed knee against healthy controls revealed similar significant differences for both muscles (semitendinosus, P = .011; biceps femoris, P = .024). CONCLUSION: The results showed that harvesting the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction significantly increased the electromechanical delay of the knee flexors. Increased hamstring electromechanical delay might impair knee safety and performance by modifying the transfer time of muscle tension to the tibia and therefore affecting muscle response during sudden movements in athletic activities. However, further investigation is required to identify whether the increased electromechanical delay of the hamstrings can actually influence optimal sports performance and increase the risk for knee injury in athletes with anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions.",2009,37,11,2179-86,10.1177/0363546509340771,#3010,Ristanis 2009,
333,12785098.0,Species variations in cDNA sequence and exon splicing patterns in the extensible I-band region of cardiac titin: relation to passive tension.,J Muscle Res Cell Motil,"Titin is believed to play a major role in passive tension development in cardiac muscle. The cDNA sequence of cardiac titin in the I-band sarcomeric region was determined for several mammalian species. Contiguous sequences of 3749, 12,230, 6602, and 11,850 base pairs have been obtained for the rat N2B, rat N2BA, dog N2B, and dog N2BA isoforms respectively. The length of the PEVK region of the N2B isoform did not correlate with rest tension properties since the only species showing an altered length was the dog that expressed a shorter form. No differences were found between the N2B PEVK lengths in ventricular and atrial muscle. New N2BA splicing pathways in the first tandem Ig region were found in human and dog cardiac muscle. Most of the rat and dog sequences were 85-95% identical with the reported human sequence. However, the N2B unique amino acid sequences of rat and dog were only 51 and 67% identical to human. The rat N2B unique sequence was 526 amino acids in length compared to 572 in human. The difference in length was due to deletion of amino acid segments from six different regions of the N2B unique domain. Patterns of PEVK exon expression were also much different in the dog, human, and rat. Six separate dog N2BA PEVK clones were sequenced, and all had different exon splice combinations yielding PEVK lengths ranging from 703 to 900 amino acids. In contrast a rat N2BA clone had a PEVK length of 525 amino acids, while a human clone had an 908 amino acid PEVK segment. Thus, in addition to the higher proportion of the shorter N2B isoform found in rat compared with dog cardiac muscle observed previously, shorter N2B unique and N2BA PEVK segments may also contribute to the greater passive tension in cardiac muscle from rats.",2002,23,6-May,473-82,10.1023/a:1023410523184,#3011,Greaser 2002,

Homozygous mdm/mdm mice develop a progressive muscular dystrophy, leading to death at approximately 2 months of age. We surveyed the transcriptomes of skeletal muscles from 24 day old homozygous mdm/mdm and +/+ wild-type mice, an age when MDM animals have normal passive and active tensions and sarcomeric structure. Of the 12488 genes surveyed (U74 affymetrix array), 75 genes were twofold to 30-fold differentially expressed, including CARP (cardiac ankyrin repeat protein), ankrd2/Arpp (a CARP-like protein) and MLP (muscle LIM protein), all of which associate with the titin filament system. The four genes most strongly affected (eightfold to 30-fold change) were all members of the CARP-regulated Nkx-2.5-dependent signal pathway, and CARP mRNA level was 30-fold elevated in MDM skeletal muscle tissues. The CARP protein overexpressed in MDM became associated with the I-band region of the sarcomere. The mdm mutation excises the C-terminal portion of titin's N2A region, abolishing its interaction with p94/calpain-3 protease. Thus, the composition of the titin N2A protein complex is altered in MDM by incorporation of CARP and loss of p94/calpain-3. These changes were absent from the following control tissues (1). cardiac muscles from homozygous mdm/mdm animals, (2). skeletal and cardiac muscle from heterozygous mdm/+ animals, and (3). dystrophic muscles from MDX mice. Thus, the altered composition of the titin N2A complex is specific for the titin-based skeletal muscular dystrophy in MDM.",2004,336,1,145-54,10.1016/j.jmb.2003.12.021,#3012,Witt 2004,
335,6861548.0,When should respiratory muscles be exercised?,Chest,"1. Normal respiratory muscles have a large functional reserve. 2. Muscles have a tremendous capacity for adaptation. Adaptation is task-specific (eg, muscles use similar motor units for the same tasks). 3. Muscular fatigue results when motor units are required to perform an unaccustomed task. Continued effort in the face of fatigue, especially high-tension low-repetition effort, may produce a reversible ""use atrophy"" (eg, fiber damage, splitting, and regeneration). 4. Exercising damaged or regenerating muscle may produce irreversible damage. 5. Exercising the respiratory muscles of some patients may make them more susceptible to fatigue or, at least, produce no further improvement in function. Alternating rest and exercise improves pulmonary function tests in some patients. 6. Retraining a weak or damaged muscle requires that it first be ""shut down"" and rested before attempting retraining. 7. Training a rested muscle to different tasks--before these tasks are needed--may be the critical step in successful rehabilitation. 8. Resistance breathing probably improves both respiratory muscle strength and respiratory muscle endurance. 9.

How best can they be retrained?",1983,84,1,76-84,10.1378/chest.84.1.76,#3013,,

Ryanodine-induced contractures may provide greater sensitivity and specificity for malignant hyperthermia (MH) diagnosis. This study investigated the effects of ryanodine concentration and stimulus frequency to distinguish between MH susceptible (MHS) and MH non-susceptible (MHN) dogs. Increasing ryanodine concentrations (1, 2.5 and 5 microM) increased peak isometric contracture tension, but similar responses in MHS and MHN muscle precluded use for diagnosis. Time to tension onset and to peak tension decreased with increasing ryanodine concentration, and these times were shorter in MH skeletal muscle. Increasing stimulus frequency (0.1, 0.5 and 1 Hz) decreased the time to tension onset and to peak tension, but the effect was greater in MHN muscle which decreased the difference between MHN and MHS muscle responses. When ryanodine contracture tension onset time was selected to detect MHS muscle, combinations of either 0.1 Hz and 1 microM ryanodine or 0.5 Hz and 1 microM ryanodine reduced the probabilty of a false diagnosis to less than 1%. Similar studies performed on human muscle might identify optimal stimulus frequency and ryanodine concentration for detecting MH in patients.",1997,282,3,1331-6,,#3014,Sudo 1997,
337,16530316.0,[Facial rejuvenation and concentric malar lift: the FACE RECURVE concept].,Ann Chir Plast Esthet,"Cell ageing is responsible for the increasingly creased appearance of our skin. The ageing of the structures of the face is attributed primarily to the effect of gravity on the tissues. The theory expounded below sets out to prove that the main and initial cause of this ageing is the repeated contractions of the mimic muscles. This concept attributes only a secondary role to gravity in the ageing process, which is initially brought about by muscular contractions. An MRI study recently made it possible to demonstrate the anterior convexity curve of the mimic muscles in the young subject. This curve is due to the existence at the back of these muscles of a deep fat pad. In the young subject, the extent of its convexity and its location give a specific, youthful character to the movements, in terms of direction and amplitude, of the facial muscles. With age, the muscle gradually straightens and shortens due to the repeated contractions that expel the underlying fat and increase the tonus at rest. The application of these new findings to the ageing of the face gives rise to new technical possibilities both in the field of medicine and aesthetic surgery. These new techniques have the same targets: segments of the mimic muscles (maintain over time a good muscular curve and a low tonus at rest) and the underlying fatty convexities. As far as medicine is concerned, the combination of botulinum toxin and filling has proved its worth. But two technical elements are new: the filling products must, at several points, be injected primarily behind the muscle to treat the depressions naturally and restore the initial curve of the overlying muscle. A very low number of units (a quarter to one unit) of botulinum toxin must be injected into certain muscles to diminish the tonus at rest of these muscles without diminishing their strength in maximum contraction. In surgery, new possibilities to treat premature ageing include procedures that combine segmentary muscular weakening, micro liposuctions and retromuscular reinjections. The advantage with regard to the medical procedures is greater stability over time and the greater precision of these muscular actions (one third of a muscle can be weakened for example) and the fat reinjections can be more stable. These procedures can be performed under local anesthesia. In cases of more advanced ageing, surgery offers new treatment possibilities that include, for the midface region, the concentric malar lift. It replaces, on the orbital rim, the sub-orbicularis oculi fat that has descended eccentrically as a result of the contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The procedure, using the subperiosteal detachment plane, is therefore stable over time. At the same time, specific muscles are weakened. The aims of restoring fatty volumes and muscular tonuses are thus achieved. Similarly, in the neck, the platysma muscle is specifically weakened. Each area is studied in line with its specificities. For the first time, the skin tension of the facelift has no more to be maximum to treat the relief of the jawl line, of the palpebro malar groove and so on. The skin tension becomes moderate, just to remove the excess of skin. The relief is faded with the specific muscular and fatty action.

The establishment of this model of biofeedback learning in monkeys enables work on mechanisms mediating the modes of biofeedback most used in clinical practice. Results suggest that biofeedback learning does not need to be mediated by the type of human-specific cognitive strategies employed by humans.,1998,23,1,12-Jan,10.1023/a:1022185012141,#3016,Gruber 1998,
339,3680812.0,In vivo and in vitro human airway responsiveness to leukotriene D4 in patients without asthma.,J Allergy Clin Immunol,"We have examined the in vivo airway responsiveness to leukotriene (LT) D4 in 11 patients without asthma who were to undergo thoracotomy and compared this responsiveness with in vitro sensitivity and in vitro contractility of bronchial smooth muscle to LTD4. In vivo responses were measured by the provocation concentration producing a 10% fall in FEV1, a 30% fall in partial flow rate at 30% of total lung capacity from a partial forced expiratory maneuver, and a 35% fall in specific airway conductance. In vitro sensitivity was measured as the concentration of LTD4 producing a 50% of maximum contraction and maximum-induced tension. The smooth muscle content of the bronchial strip was estimated microscopically, and the absolute quantity of muscle strip was compared with the maximum tension generated by that bronchial smooth muscle sample. In vivo results varied over 2 log units, and in vitro sensitivity, over 1 log unit. The absolute amount of smooth muscle present in bronchial strips correlated with maximal LTD4-induced tension. There was no relationship between in vivo responsiveness and in vitro sensitivity nor between in vivo responsiveness and maximum tension generated, even when this was corrected for the proportion of smooth muscle present in each bronchial strip. These results suggest that in vivo airway responsiveness to LTD4 is not determined by airway smooth muscle sensitivity or its ability to generate tension alone. Other factors must be influencing the response of the airway to LTD4. Nevertheless, the finding of a positive correlation between the absolute amount of smooth muscle present in bronchial strips and maximal LTD4-induced tension suggests that hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle may contribute to in vivo airway hyperresponsiveness.",1987,80,5,688-94,10.1016/0091-6749(87)90288-0,#3017,Roberts 1987,
340,11733852.0,Expiratory muscle endurance in middle-aged healthy subjects.,Lung,"To evaluate expiratory muscle endurance in middle-aged healthy subjects using incremental as well as constant expiratory loads, 14 healthy volunteers (51 +/- 16 years) were submitted to a specific endurance test, which was performed breathing against a threshold valve, and was divided into two parts. In part I, the load was progressively increased (50 g each 2 min) until task failure occurred. The mean mouth pressure generated against the highest load held for at least 60 sec was defined as the maximal expiratory sustainable pressure (Pth(max)). In part II, each subject breathed against a constant submaximal expiratory load (80% Pth(max)) until task failure occurred (expiratory endurance time or Tth(80)). Both parts of the test were repeated 24-48 h later. Progressive expiratory loading induced a linear increase in mouth expiratory pressure and the Pth(max) obtained was 141 +/- 43 cm H(2)O, representing 74 +/- 28% of the maximal expiratory pressure (PE(max)). Under constant loads, the Tth(80) was 17 +/- 9 min. At the end-point of both parts, the tension time index for expiratory muscles was dramatically increased (>0.25), and both EMG central frequency and PE(max) were decreased with no changes in maximal inspiratory pressure or inspiratory capacity. Extreme dyspnea was present in most of the subjects but no complications were observed. The endurance of expiratory muscles can be easily assessed in healthy subjects using this method, which has acceptable reproducibility and tolerance.",2001,179,2,93-103,10.1007/s004080000049,#3018,Orozco-Levi 2001,

The device consists of two handles allowing for simultaneous measurement of bimanual hand grip forces (GF) and different patterns of load forces (LF) exerted during compression and tension along the longitudinal axis. In order to assess the reliability of the obtained measures, eight healthy subjects were tested over three consecutive test, while three moderately impaired neurological patients were tested once. In healthy subjects, high coordination was observed between GFs and LFs, as well as between two GFs and two LFs. The results also suggest a satisfactory task performance in regards to exerting the instructed LF profile, as well as a sufficient, but not excessive GF. The reliability of most of the assessed variables proved to be either moderate or high. When compared to healthy subjects, the data obtained from neurological patients mainly revealed irregular patterns of LFs, excessive GFs, as well as a relatively weak relationship between GFs and LFs. It was concluded that the evaluated methodological approach can be applied not only to explore uni- and bi-manual coordination of arm and hand grip forces in various prehensile activities, but also to serve as a basis for future development of specific clinical tests for neurological patients and other populations that demonstrate impaired hand function.",2005,15,6,556-63,10.1016/j.jelekin.2005.03.003,#3019,Jaric 2005,
342,6662774.0,Respiratory-related activity of upper airway muscles in anesthetized rabbit.,J Appl Physiol Respir Environ Exerc Physiol,"The electromyographic activity of the glossal, suprahyoid, infrahyoid, and pharyngeal muscles was examined during spontaneous respiration in rabbits anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride. This activity was then correlated with phases of the respiratory cycle. Our findings indicate that the overwhelming majority of the muscles comprising these groups show activity that increased during inspiration and returns to the background level during expiration and the end-expiratory pause. The exceptions are the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle, which demonstrates increased activity during expiration and the end-expiratory pause, and the stylohyoid major and digastric muscles, whose activity was not modulated with respiration. In general, the results obtained under ketamine anesthesia are in agreement with the studies on a more limited number of muscles in humans during sleep or in animal studies utilizing light anesthesia. Furthermore, the use of ketamine avoids the central suppressant effects produced by barbituate anesthesia. It has been argued that the upper airway muscles are rhythmically active during respiration to maintain the patency of the upper airway. Both the number of muscles that are rhythmically active and their strict correlation with specific phases of the respiratory cycle suggest that the forces exerted on the upper airway are complex and that peak tension is generated during inspiration. Further studies are required to evaluate the effects of ketamine anesthesia on these upper airway muscles before this rabbit model can be utilized to examine respiratory disorders of the upper airway.",1983,55,6,1830-6,10.1152/jappl.1983.55.6.1830,#3020,Rothstein 1983,

Data were recorded with concentric needle electrodes from the biceps brachii, first dorsal interosseous, tibialis anterior, and calf muscles. Recordings were analyzed from 35 normal subjects as well as 24 consecutive patients referred for evaluation of neuropathic disorders. Direct tension measurements were not required. Reasoning from studies in normal subjects in which Vrms/T values were related to measurements of relative tension, the data were recorded during strong muscle contractions of less than 80% of maximum tension as monitored by mean amplitude values. For all 5 muscles, mean Vrms/T values > or = 1.0 calculated from four separate needle sites were significantly more frequent in the patients than controls (p < 0.012-0.0001). There were 13 muscles in which relevant conduction studies were abnormal and Vrms/T > or = 1.0 were the only abnormality of the needle EMG examination. In addition, a Vrms/T of > or = 1.0 was present in 10/14 muscles in which abnormalities might have been expected but where other needle EMG parameters were unremarkable and relevant nerve conductions normal. This study indicates that Vrms/T measurements can add meaningfully to the electrodiagnostic evaluation of neurogenic dysfunction.",1995,18,12,1398-402,10.1002/mus.880181209,#3021,Fisher 1995,
344,26200198.0,Influence on Strength and Flexibility of a Swing Phase-Specific Hamstring Eccentric Program in Sprinters' General Preparation.,J Strength Cond Res,"Hamstring injuries are common in sprinters and mainly occur during the terminal swing phase. Eccentric training has been shown to reduce hamstring injury rate by improving several risk factors. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an additional swing phase-specific hamstring eccentric training in well-trained sprinters performed at the commencement of the winter preparation is more efficient to improve strength, ratio, optimum angle, and flexibility than a similar program without hamstring eccentric exercises. Twenty sprinters were randomly allocated to an eccentric (n = 10) or a control group (n = 10). Both groups performed their usual track and field training throughout the study period. Sprinters in the eccentric group performed an additional 6-week hamstring eccentric program, which was specific to the swing phase of the running cycle (eccentric high-load open-chain kinetic movements covering the whole hamstring length-tension relationship preformed at slow to moderate velocity). Isokinetic and flexibility measurements were performed before and after the intervention. The eccentric group increased hamstring peak torques in concentric at 60° · s(-1) by 16% (p < 0.001) and at 240° · s(-1) by 10% (p < 0.01), in eccentric at 30° · s(-1) by 20% (p < 0.001) and at 120° · s(-1) by 22% (p < 0.001), conventional and functional ratios by 12% (p < 0.001), and flexibility by 4° (p < 0.01), whereas the control group increased hamstring peak torques only in eccentric at 30° · s(-1) by 6% (p ≤ 0.05) and at 120° · s(-1) by 6% (p < 0.01). It was concluded that an additional swing phase-specific hamstring eccentric training in sprinters seems to be crucial to address different risk factors for hamstring strain injuries, such as eccentric and concentric strength, hamstring-to-quadriceps ratio ratio, and flexibility.",2016,30,2,525-32,10.1519/JSC.0000000000001103,#3022,Guex 2016,
345,2020254.0,Reserpine-induced post-receptor reduction in muscarinic-mediated airway smooth muscle contraction.,Life Sci,"Radioligand binding was conducted on airways of the rat and human, surgically subdivided into trachea, lung airways, and parenchyma. 3H-QNB bound uniformly to receptors in separate sections of the rat and human airway. Receptor densities generally were ranked: lung airways greater than trachea greater than parenchyma. Receptor subtypes were identified mostly by pirenzepine displacement of bound 3H-QNB. The rat trachea, and rat and human lung airways had a uniformly low affinity for pirenzepine while rat and human parenchyma demonstrated both high and low affinity pirenzepine binding. Inhibition of methacholine-stimulated smooth muscle contraction by the M1 receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, and M2 receptor antagonist, gallamine, was studied in rat trachea and bronchus in vitro. Schild plot pA2 values were compatible with low potency antagonism, thereby favoring the presence of M3 receptors at these smooth muscle sites. Reserpine treatment of rats (0.5 mg kg-1 day-1 for 7 days) produced a decrease in peak tension in response to methacholine without changing the muscarinic receptor character (Kd 3H-QNB), population density (Bmax in fmol mg-1 protein), or function (methacholine EC50). These results indicate that muscarinic receptor heterogeneity exists in the airway of both laboratory rat and man. While the muscarinic receptor subserving airway smooth muscle contraction appears to be the M3 subtype, decreased contractile responses to methacholine by trachea and bronchus from reserpine-treated rats were receptor independent.",1991,48,18,1705-13,10.1016/0024-3205(91)90206-q,#3023,Gardier 1991,

We examined the effect of UDCA on tension development in dystrophic muscle. METHODS: Isometric tension development was examined in costal diaphragms that were freshly isolated from vehicle and UDCA treated mdx mice. Percent recovery scores were obtained by directly comparing these measurements to those obtained from age-matched nondystrophic mice. RESULTS: Vehicle treated mdx mice exhibited significantly reduced optimal muscle lengths (lo ) and specific twitch and tetanic tensions compared with age-matched nondystrophic mice. UDCA treated preparations exhibited significantly improved tension development with a 33% recovery score. CONCLUSIONS: Because UDCA is used in treating certain clinical disorders, these results provide a rationale for human clinical trials using this and related drugs for treatment of Duchenne and related muscular dystrophies.",2016,53,3,431-7,10.1002/mus.24755,#3025,Carlson 2016,Duchenne muscular dystrophy
347,2940612.0,Review of the morbidity of 300 free-flap donor sites.,Plast Reconstr Surg,"Donor-site morbidity in 300 consecutive free flaps was reviewed to identify their etiologies and potentially prevent their recurrence in future cases. An overall morbidity rate of 20 percent was seen in this series. Secondary surgical procedures specific for donor-site problems were required in 7.7 percent of patients. Major complications occurred in 2.3 percent of the donor sites. From this review it is apparent that major donor-site morbidity is uncommon and most donor-site problems could probably have been avoided. Our recommendations are as follows: closure of the donor site to avoid excessive tension must be carefully planned preoperatively, donor-site anatomy and flap elevation techniques must be precisely understood, surgical retractors must be carefully placed to avoid injury to nearby structures, the donor site should be closed immediately following pedicle division, thus minimizing wound exposures, and complete surgical hemostasis is mandatory.",1986,77,6,948-53,10.1097/00006534-198606000-00013,#3026,Colen 1986,

Specific stimuli are either high tension in contracting myofibrils or high turnover rates in the oxidative metabolism of the muscle cell. Structural adaptations consist of the synthesis of additional myofibrillar material or increased volume density of both interfibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria. Transformation of fibre types at the level of the molecular structure of myosin seems possible with high-intensity training of long duration. Functional adaptations consist of higher activities of important enzymes in either anaerobic or aerobic energy metabolism and of larger intracellular stores of the respective substrates. All adaptations are highly specific and reversible through detraining or immobilization of the muscle.,1985,115,,365-73,10.1242/jeb.115.1.365,#3027,Howald 1985,
349,10716614.0,Bone surface strains and internal bony pressures at the jaw joint of the miniature pig during masticatory muscle contraction.,Arch Oral Biol,"The long-standing debate on whether the jaw joint is loaded is due in part to the complexity of the factors involved, including a number of different muscles, each with a potentially unique role. This study sought to elucidate how two major jaw muscles, the masseter and the lateral pterygoid, influence jaw-joint loading. Twenty-five 10-month-old miniature pigs were divided into two groups, controls and pigs with the lateral capsular ligament of the jaw joint stripped surgically; this was expected to affect loading by destabilizing the joint. Rosette strain gauges were bonded to: (1) the lateral surface of the squamosal bone (equivalent to the squamosal portion of the temporal bone in humans) at the level of the articular eminence; (2) the lateral surface of the condylar neck; and (3) the lateral surface of the mandibular corpus below the molar region. Semiconductor pressure transducers were placed underneath the surfaces of the anterior slope of the condyle and the posterior slope of the articular eminence through drilled holes. Strains and internal bony pressures were recorded during stimulated tetanic contractions of the masseter or lateral pterygoid muscles. Masseter contraction, either alone or with the contralateral muscle, caused net tension in the squamosal bone and net compression in the condylar neck. The orientations were approximately vertical to the occlusal plane. Masseter contraction elevated both the condylar and eminence pressures from their resting values. The strains caused by lateral pterygoid contractions were much smaller than for the masseter with the exception of the condylar location. Ipsilateral lateral pterygoid contraction decreased both the condylar and eminence pressures from their resting values, perhaps because condylar movement altered the contact between the joint surfaces. Surgical disruption enhanced both pressure changes and bone strains under either muscle contraction but their overall patterns were not altered. In conclusion, both strains and pressures in the jaw joint varied according to specific muscle activity.",2000,45,2,95-112,10.1016/s0003-9969(99)00127-2,#3028,Liu 2000,
350,19881316.0,Oxygen tensiometry as a predictor of wound healing in total ankle arthroplasty.,Acta Orthop Traumatol Turc,"OBJECTIVES: Total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) typically involves an anterior approach to the ankle that has been shown to have a risk for wound healing problems. We explored the possibility of using oxygen tensiometry as a predictor of incision healing problems in patients undergoing TAA. METHODS: The study included 25 patients who underwent TAA with the Scandinavian Total Ankle Replacement (STAR) system at our institution during a three-year period. Transcutaneous oxygen measurements of both ankles were obtained postoperatively to determine whether the results of transcutaneous oxygen tensiometry correlated with wound healing problems. Patients with wound healing problems were compared with those who had an uneventful incision healing. RESULTS: Seven patients (28%) had wound healing problems after TAA, and five patients (20%) had early wound erythema. Wound healing problems included delayed healing in five patients and dehiscence in two patients. Three patients had transcutaneous oxygen tension of less than 40 mmHg (a threshold for impaired skin oxygenation) on the operative side, of whom one had healing difficulty whereas two did not. When the threshold was extended to 50 mmHg, seven patients (28%) had low readings, two having wound healing problems. There was no significant difference with respect to oxygen measurements between patients with and without wound healing problems (p=0.3). CONCLUSION: Oxygen tensiometry is not thought to be useful for predicting patients at risk for postoperative wound healing complications after TAA, suggesting that, if adequate pulses are present before surgery, the trauma of using excessive superficial traction on the skin during surgery is more responsible for wound healing problems than the underlying blood supply.",2009,43,5,381-5,10.3944/AOTT.2009.381,#3029,Farber 2009,
351,18805187.0,Is the morphologic mitral valve in discordant atrioventricular connections always normal?,Ann Thorac Surg,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine structural features and variations in the mitral valve guarding inflow of the morphologic left ventricle in hearts with discordant atrioventricular connections. METHODS: Morphologic investigation was carried out on the inlet valve to the morphologic left ventricle in 48 autopsied specimens with this particular entity of malformation. RESULTS: The tension apparatus was straddling to the morphologic right ventricle in 2. Another 34 hearts had a bifoliate valve and the papillary muscles abnormally oriented; a solitary papillary muscle in 3, two papillary muscles but deviated in 5, one of two papillary muscles being dysmorphic in 9, and three or more papillary muscles in 17. The origin of these papillary muscles was frequently deviated. In 5 hearts with a trifoliate or quadrifoliate valve, multiple papillary muscles were also the case. One of these had thick leaflets, a part of which was adherent to a membranous flap around the ventricular septal defect as well as to subpulmonary fibrous tissue tags. Eventually, the valve was comparable with the mitral valve seen in the normally structured heart in only 7 hearts (15%). There was no obvious correlation noted between the presence of abnormality in the mitral valve and that in the tricuspid valve. CONCLUSIONS: Architectural abnormalities are not rare in the morphologic mitral valve in this setting.

352,9623444.0,Multicentre evaluation of ryanodine contracture testing in malignant hyperthermia. The European Malignant Hyperthermia Group.,Br J Anaesth,"A common protocol for in vitro contracture testing using the plant alkaloid ryanodine has been used by the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group since 1993. This protocol describes a test using I mumol/litre of high purity ryanodine (98%) added as a single bolus dose. The main aim of this study was to compare the results obtained with this test between laboratories with a view to assessing the validity of adopting common diagnostic end-points for use in future collaborative studies. In order to do this it was first necessary to determine the optimum cut-off values of the end-points for discriminating between patients diagnosed as susceptible or not to malignant hyperthermia. The end-points under evaluation were expressed in terms of time after application of ryanodine at which a certain degree of contracture develops. In this study, four end-points were investigated: time to initial contracture development (Ot); time to development of a 10-mN contracture (10t); time from addition of ryanodine to when baseline tension exceeds pre-drug tension (0tp); and time for contracture to reach 10 mN above pre-drug baseline tension (10tp). This protocol was developed initially and used by three investigating centres and the initial assessment of the end-points and their discriminatory ability was made using the first 100 patients from each of centres 1 and 2, and the first 90 patients from centre No. 3. Optimal cut-off values for each of the end-points were determined using logistic regression analysis. Discriminatory ability was improved by combining the Ot and 10t end-points (P < 0.05) but not significantly by combining the 0tp and 10tp end-points. Both methods of categorization were highly sensitive and specific compared with the current standard diagnostic tests. Results from eight additional diagnostic centres which have used the ryanodine contracture test more recently, while indicating that susceptible and normal individuals can be distinguished within a single laboratory, produced a level of variability between testing centres for the ryanodine contracture test that is incompatible with the use of common cut-off values. Possible causes for this variability between laboratories are discussed.",1998,80,3,389-94,10.1093/bja/80.3.389,#3031,Hopkins 1998,
353,20931316.0,[Arthroscopic reconstruction of the anterolateral bundle of the posterior cruciate ligament in single-bundle technique with autologous hamstring grafts].,Oper Orthop Traumatol,"OBJECTIVE: Restoration of the function of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). INDICATIONS: Chronic posterior instability with posterior tibial translation of >10 mm. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Fixed posterior drawer, local infections at the knee joint, local soft-tissue damage, poor compliance of the patient. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Surgery starts with arthroscopic examination of the knee joint and therapy of associated injuries (meniscus and cartilage injuries). Harvesting of the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons is performed via a 3 cm long skin incision 1 cm distally and medially of the tibial tuberosity. The tendons are folded to a four- or five-stranded graft with a minimum length of 10 cm. The femoral tunnel for the graft is drilled via a deep anterolateral portal under arthroscopic control. For drilling of the tibial tunnel, a posteromedial portal is needed. The tibial insertion of the PCL is debrided with a shaver and a specific raspatory. For tibial tunnel placement, a specific closed aimer is used and a Kirschner wire is placed in the center of the tibial insertion. This Kirschner wire is overdrilled using a cannulated drill with a diameter according to the graft size. After femoral fixation, the graft is tensioned in 90° flexion with 80 N. At the femoral and tibial side, a hybrid fixation is performed with a button (flipp tack) and a resorbable interference screw. If there are any signs of posterolateral instability, a posterolateral corner reconstruction is performed before tensioning and fixation of the PCL graft. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: For 6 weeks, the knee is immobilized in extension with a posterior tibial support (PTS) brace (Medi, Bayreuth, Germany). Passive range of motion exercises should be performed in prone position (first 2 weeks 0-0-30°, 3rd to 4th week 0-0-60°, 5th to 6th week 0-0-90°). After the first 6 weeks, a movable brace is needed at daytime. At nighttime, the patient has to wear the PTS brace. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2006, a PCL reconstruction in singlebundle technique was performed in 58 patients. In 42 cases, a simultaneous reconstruction of the posterolateral corner was done. The Lysholm Score improved from 62.2 to 88.4 points, the Tegner Activity Score from 3.3 to 5.4 points.",2010,22,4,354-72,10.1007/s00064-010-9034-5,#3032,Petersen 2010,
354,21319218.0,Effects of surgical correction for the treatment of adult acquired flatfoot deformity: a computational investigation.,J Orthop Res,"Computational models of the foot/ankle complex were developed to predict the biomechanical consequences of surgical procedures that correct for stage II adult acquired flatfoot deformity. Cadaveric leg and foot bony anatomy was captured by CT imaging in neutral flexion and imported to the modeling software. Ligaments were approximated as tension only springs attached at insertion sites. Muscle contraction of the gastrocnemius/soleus complex was simulated through force vectors and desired external loads applied to the model. Ligament stiffnesses were modified to reflect stage II flatfoot damage, followed by integration of corrective osteotomies-medializing calcaneal osteotomy (MCO) and Evans and calcaneocuboid distraction arthrodesis (CCDA)--to treat flatfoot. Joint angles, tissue strains, calcaneocuboid contact force, and plantar loads were analyzed. The flatfoot simulation demonstrated clinical signs of disease evidenced by degradation of joint alignment. Repair states corrected these joint misalignments with MCO having greatest impact in the hindfoot, and Evans/CCDA having greatest effect in the mid- and forefoot. The lateral procedures unevenly strained plantar structures, while offloading the medial forefoot, and increased loading on the lateral forefoot, which was amplified by combining with MCO. The Evans procedure raised calcaneocuboid joint contact force to twice intact levels. Computational results are in agreement with clinical and experimental findings. The model demonstrated potential precursors to such complications as lateral tightness and arthritic development and may thus be useful as a predictor of surgical outcomes.",2011,29,7,1047-54,10.1002/jor.21379,#3033,Iaquinto 2011,

STUDY DESIGN: Small myometrial arteries were isolated from 6 patients with idiopathic menorrhagia and 4 controls. The contractile responses to thromboxane mimetic (U46619) and endothelin-1 were assessed before and after incubation with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester alone or in combination with indomethacin (Indo). Endothelium-dependent dilation to bradykinin and basal tension were compared before and after incubation with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester alone, or with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester in combination with indomethacin. RESULTS: Constriction to endothelin-1 was enhanced in idiopathic menorrhagia arteries (P < .05). Idiopathic menorrhagia arteries demonstrated enhanced basal tension after incubation with N(w)-nitro-L arginine methyl ester, which was further exaggerated by indomethacin. NOS inhibition had no effect on basal tension in controls, but basal tension was enhanced after inhibition of cyclooxygenase-derived products (P < .05). Bradykinin-mediated dilation was significantly increased in idiopathic menorrhagia (P < .05).

This study evaluated the prevalence of tendinous insertion of the pectoralis minor by arthroscopy and diagnostic performances of MRI and suggests its clinical implication in rotator cuff repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study prospectively recruited 99 consecutive patients for arthroscopic exploration of pectoralis minor insertion. Preoperative MRIs were evaluated to detect tendinous insertion of the pectoralis minor by 2 independent, blinded observers, and these results were correlated with arthroscopy as the gold standard. During arthroscopy, the effect of this variation on supraspinatus tendon tear and repair was evaluated. RESULTS: Tendinous insertion of the pectoralis minor was found in 11 patients (11%) at arthroscopy. The sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31%-89%), the specificity was 82% (95% CI, 72%-89%), and the accuracy was 80% (95% CI, 72%-88%). Intraobserver and interobserver reliability tests showed moderate agreements. In 7 patients, it tethered the retracted supraspinatus tendon from mobilization and gave rise to tension on the repaired cuff, which warranted complete resection of the pectoralis minor tendon for a tension-free cuff repair. CONCLUSIONS: Tendinous insertion of the pectoralis minor existed with 11% prevalence in our series and could be preoperatively detected on MRI. During arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, it can be an obstacle to supraspinatus tendon mobilization and repair.",2015,24,6,848-53,10.1016/j.jse.2015.03.003,#3035,Lim 2015,Pectoralis minor

The fibre type composition showed a higher proportion of the oxidative type IIBd fibres in the middle-aged group [5 months old; 39.8 +/- 6.8 vs. 23.6 +/- 4.2% of the fibre area in the young rats (1.3 months old)] in contrast to the type IIBm fibres (52.9 vs. 67.9%, respectively), while the old group (22 months old) was not different from the middle-aged group. Work output in the last contraction (relative to the first contraction) was not different between the age-groups (53.1 +/- 18.1; 48.0 +/- 6.5 and 61.1 +/- 6.2%, respectively). High-energy phosphate utilization was not different between the groups (150.6 +/- 11.2; 154.6 +/- 15.6 and 157.2 +/- 7.0 mumol g-1 dry wt, respectively). However, the efficiency was approximately 30% lower in the muscles of the youngest group, which corresponds with a lower specific power and specific tension. Since the change in fibre type composition is unlikely to be the cause of the low efficiency in the young animals, the causes remain unclear, but may be related to the rapid growth of the young rats in our study.",1993,147,4,347-55,10.1111/j.1748-1716.1993.tb09511.x,#3036,DeHaan 1993,
358,19329921.0,Hypothermia exerts negative inotropy in human atrial preparations: in vitro-comparison to rabbit myocardium.,J Cardiovasc Surg (Torino),"AIM: We investigated the effect of mild hypothermia on the contractility and calcium response of atrial and ventricular myocardium. METHODS: Human atrial tissue was excised during cannulation process from patients undergoing elective open heart surgery following informed consent. Trabeculae were carefully dissected and compared to rabbit atrial and ventricular trabeculae. All probes were electrically stimulated while clamped to a force transducer and suspended in buffer media. Developed force, time to peak tension and time to 50% of relaxation were measured during mild hypothermia (37-31 degrees C). SR Ca++-content was studied by rapid cooling contractures, Ca++-responsiveness by a stepwise increase of extracellular calcium concentration to 10 mM. RESULTS: Hypothermia decreased twitch tension and SR Ca++-content in human atrial myocardium but increased contractility and SR Ca++-content in rabbit atrial and rabbit ventricular myocardium. Cooling induced a lengthening of contraction and relaxation times in all preparations. In all preparations the positive inotropic response to calcium was diminished at 34 degrees C and almost abolished at 31 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to rabbit ventricular and atrial myocardium, human atrial myocardium showed a negative inotropic effect when exposed to hypothermia. This alteration could be secondary to a declined SR-Ca++ storage and decreased atrial calcium sensitivity. Calcium dependent inotropy is suppressed at temperatures below 34 degrees C.",2009,50,2,239-45,,#3037,Goetzenich 2009,
359,23957432.0,Sevoflurane is less sensitive than halothane for in vitro detection of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,"BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane is a known triggering agent of malignant hyperthermia (MH). The present study analyzed different effects of sevoflurane on skeletal muscle of MH susceptible and nonsusceptible individuals in vitro and compared the results to the standardized test protocol with halothane and caffeine. A potential influence of a present ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) mutation was investigated. METHODS: Muscle bundles of 24 MH-susceptible patients with or without an RyR1 mutation, 35 MH-nonsusceptible and 10 MH-equivocal patients were exposed either to sevoflurane 8 vol% bolus or increasing doses of 2, 4, 6, and 8 vol%. In MH-positive patients, a screening for mutations in the RyR1 gene was performed. RESULTS: The in vitro parameters initial length, weight, predrug resting tension, and predrug twitch height did not differ between the groups. Sevoflurane caused significant contractures in MH-susceptible but not in MH-nonsusceptible muscle after increasing doses [1.4 (0.3-6.0) vs. 0 (0-0) mN] and after bolus application [6.9 (2.4-21.4) vs. 0 (0-0) mN]. However, only 50% of the susceptible patients developed contractures ≥ 2 mN after increasing concentrations while 83% did so after rapid bolus administration. Presence of an RyR1 mutation was detected in 36% of the examined MH-positive patients but had no influence on developing contractures. CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane-induced contractures do not reliably detect MH susceptibility on an individual level. Therefore, sevoflurane is no suitable alternative for diagnostic use. Mutation-specific effects regarding contracture sizes after incubation with sevoflurane, halothane, or caffeine were not found.",2013,57,9,1161-6,10.1111/aas.12171,#3038,Johannsen 2013,
360,10902085.0,Tension delivery from short fibers in long muscles.,Exerc Sport Sci Rev,"Many of the muscles of larger mammals (including humans) feature fibers that terminate without direct tendinous insertion, so fibers in these muscles must deliver their tension into the muscle belly. This raises many important issues regarding the pathway of tension delivery from the sarcomere to the tendon and the role of series-fiber and connective tissue compliance in the properties of the tension delivered.

STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. MATERIAL: Muscle biopsies from 63 patients, including 29 classified as susceptible to MH (MHS) and 34 classified as non-susceptible (MHN) according to criteria of the European and the North American MH groups. METHOD: The reactivity to caffeine and halothane of skinned muscle fibres was compared, according to the type of fibres, with the data of the in vitro contracture test. The type of fibres (type I: oxidative, slow; type II: glycolytic, fast) were determined with strontium dose-response curves. RESULTS: The reactivity to caffeine was significantly lower in the MHS group, for both type I and type II skinned fibres. However, in comparison with the data of the in vitro contracture tests, using the ROC curve analysis, the best sensitivity-specificity compromise was 90%-71% and 74%-84% for type I and type II skinned fibres respectively. CONCLUSION: The skinned muscle fibre tension test cannot be used instead of the in vitro contracture test for the diagnostic of MHS. However, it may strengthen the data of the latter.",1999,18,6,624-30,10.1016/s0750-7658(99)80148-8,#3040,Adnet 1999,
362,7796988.0,The effect of insulin on the vascular reactivity of isolated resistance arteries taken from healthy volunteers.,Diabetologia,"Impaired reactivity of the resistance vasculature may contribute to the development of diabetic microangiopathy by altering microvascular haemodynamics. This study investigates the acute effects of insulin on the contractility and relaxation properties of isolated human resistance arteries (< 300 microns internal diameter) taken from gluteal subcutaneous fat of 33 (18 male: 15 female) normotensive healthy volunteers (supine blood pressure 115.6 +/- 1.6/70.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg [mean +/- SEM], with no family history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Resistance arteries were mounted in a small vessel myograph to measure isometric tension. Contractile responses to noradrenaline were reduced after incubation in 1 mU/ml of insulin for 20 min (p < 0.01; Group 1). Increasing concentrations of insulin were found to reduce the contractile response to noradrenaline in a dose-dependent manner (Group 2; 0.1 mU/ml by 8% [p < 0.01], 1 mU/ml by 17% [p < 0.02] and 10 mU/ml by 22% [p < 0.01]). Sensitivity to insulin (ED50) only decreased at the highest concentration of insulin. However, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was not altered by insulin (Group 2). Time control studies (Group 3) showed that contractile and relaxation responses over the 4-h study period were unchanged. Furthermore, the length of time the vessels were exposed to insulin did not progressively impair responses (Group 4). These findings suggest that insulin may induce abnormalities in vascular smooth muscle contractility, a factor that may contribute to or exacerbate the abnormal haemodynamics observed in the capillary microcirculation of numerous vascular beds in diabetes.",1995,38,4,467-73,10.1007/BF00410285,#3041,McNally 1995,
363,16356229.0,Does taking endurance into account improve the prediction of weaning outcome in mechanically ventilated children?,Crit Care,"INTRODUCTION: We conducted the present study to determine whether a combination of the mechanical ventilation weaning predictors proposed by the collective Task Force of the American College of Chest Physicians (TF) and weaning endurance indices enhance prediction of weaning success. METHOD: Conducted in a tertiary paediatric intensive care unit at a university hospital, this prospective study included 54 children receiving mechanical ventilation (> or = 6 hours) who underwent 57 episodes of weaning. We calculated the indices proposed by the TF (spontaneous respiratory rate, paediatric rapid shallow breathing, rapid shallow breathing occlusion pressure [ROP] and maximal inspiratory pressure during an occlusion test [Pimax]) and weaning endurance indices (pressure-time index, tension-time index obtained from P(0.1) [TTI1] and from airway pressure [TTI2]) during spontaneous breathing. Performances of each TF index and combinations of them were calculated, and the best single index and combination were identified. Weaning endurance parameters (TTI1 and TTI2) were calculated and the best index was determined using a logistic regression model. Regression coefficients were estimated using the maximum likelihood ratio (LR) method. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to estimate goodness-of-fit of the model. An equation was constructed to predict weaning success. Finally, we calculated the performances of combinations of best TF indices and best endurance index. RESULTS: The best single TF index was ROP, the best TF combination was represented by the expression (0.66 x ROP) + (0.34 x Pimax), and the best endurance index was the TTI2, although their performance was poor. The best model resulting from the combination of these indices was defined by the following expression: (0.6 x ROP) - (0.1 x Pimax) + (0.5 x TTI2). This integrated index was a good weaning predictor (P < 0.01), with a LR+ of 6.4 and LR+/LR- ratio of 12.5. However, at a threshold value < 1.3 it was only predictive of weaning success (LR- = 0.5). CONCLUSION: The proposed combined index, incorporating endurance, was of modest value in predicting weaning outcome. This is the first report of the value of endurance parameters in predicting weaning success in children. Currently, clinical judgement associated with spontaneous breathing trials apparently remain superior.",2005,9,6,R798-807,10.1186/cc3898,#3043,Noizet 2005,
364,8945657.0,Distributed moment histogram: a neurophysiology based method of agonist and antagonist trunk muscle activity prediction.,J Biomech,"A neurocortical-based technique of muscle recruitment is presented to solve the muscle indeterminacy problem for lumbar torso modeling. Cortical recordings from behaving primates have established motor cortex cells that respond to a wide range of task directions, but are tuned to a preferred direction. A characteristic activity pattern of these neurons seems to be associated with effort direction. It was hypothesized that a model which recruits muscles based on a similar distribution would predict antagonistic muscle activity with greater realism than a widely referenced optimization formulation. The predictions of the Distributed Moment Histogram (DMH) method were evaluated under common speed (< 30 degrees s-1) sagittal plane lifting conditions using five subjects. The predicted forces showed high correspondence with agonist and antagonist myoelectric patterns. The mean coefficient of determination for the erector spinae was r2 = 0.91, and 0.41 for the latissimus. For the antagonistic muscles, the rectus abdominus was found to be electrically silent (< 3% MVC) and no activity was predicted by the method. The external oblique muscle was observed to be minimally active (< 16% MVC), and the DMH method predicted its mostly constant activity with a mean standard error of 1.6% MVC. The realistic antagonistic predictions supported the hypothesis and justify this cortical based technique as an alternative for muscle tension estimation in biomechanical torso modeling. A primary advantage of this method is its computational simplicity and direct physiologic analog.",1996,29,12,1587-96,,#3044,Raschke 1996,
365,35552116.0,A myogenic niche with a proper mechanical stress environment improves abdominal wall muscle repair by modulating immunity and preventing fibrosis.,Biomaterials,"Volumetric muscle loss (VML) healing is often complicated by fibrosis, which impairs muscle regeneration and function. Adjusting mechanical stress in the repair environment may modulate immunity and reduce fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to create a biomaterial with suitable tension conditions and bidirectional tissue-inducing abilities to prevent fibrosis thus promote muscle regeneration and induce aponeurosis-like structures to restore muscle force transmission. A protocol was developed to manufacture decellularized muscle aponeurosis (D-MA) patches with an intact extracellular matrix (ECM) and low cytotoxicity. D-MA optimized the mechanical stress distribution in muscle injury sites and decreased the number of proinflammatory macrophages and myofibroblasts, thereby attenuating muscle fibrosis. Muscle and aponeurosis ECM environments had different microstructures and mechanical properties, which specifically enhanced stem cell differentiation into muscle-like cells on muscle ECM and tenocyte-like cells on aponeurosis ECM in vitro. Four weeks after orthotopic implantation, the biphasic muscle-aponeurosis-like tissue was successfully regenerated by the D-MA scaffold. The regenerated muscle fibers in D-MA were more abundant than those in the fibrotic decellularized muscle (D-M) scaffold. D-MA can be used to repair abdominal defects, which significantly improves the repair outcomes. Our results suggest D-MA as a promising material for VML repair.",2022,285,,121519,10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121519,#3045,Wang 2022,Extracellular matrix environment
366,9177589.0,"Life-long endurance-trained elderly men have high aerobic power, but have similar muscle strength to non-active elderly men.",Aging (Milano),"The knee extensor and plantar flexor muscle groups of elderly men (age 70-100 years, N = 15), who since adolescence had maintained an extremely high level of endurance-based physical activity (maximal oxygen uptake 41.9 +/- 4.8 mL.kg-1min-1 in subjects < 80 years, (N = 8) and 27.1 +/- 5.4 mL.kg-1min-1 in those > 80 years, N = 5), were compared in terms of maximum voluntary isometric strength and twitch contractile properties with the muscles of elderly men of a similar age who did not undertake any regular physical exercise (68-92 years, N = 18) and of young control subjects who were recreationally active (21-36 years, N = 17). No difference was observed in the maximum voluntary strength of the knee extensors (338 +/- 130 N vs 341 +/- 137 N) or plantar flexor muscle groups (106 +/- 24 Nm vs 115 +/- 46 Nm) between the endurance-trained and elderly control subjects. This was still the case when the subjects were divided into those above and below 80 years of age, or when the data were expressed relative to body weight. Both groups of elderly subjects were markedly weaker than the young control subjects. In the plantar flexors, twitch time to peak tension (TPT) was significantly (p < 0.05) prolonged in both groups of elderly subjects vs the young control subjects. In the knee extensors, however, TPT was only prolonged in the endurance-trained athletes. Half relaxation time was prolonged in the knee extensors of both groups of elderly subjects, but only prolonged in the plantar flexors of the control subjects. The data raise the question of specificity of muscle usage, and its effect on skeletal muscle function, and suggest that endurance-based physical exercise may be of little value in maintaining muscle strength and speed of contraction in old age.",1997,9,2-Jan,80-7,10.1007/BF03340131,#3046,Harridge 1997,
367,10659449.0,Transcutaneous FES of the paralyzed quadriceps: is knee torque affected by unintended activation of the hamstrings?,J Electromyogr Kinesiol,"This study addresses the question whether unintended response of the knee flexors (hamstrings) accompanies transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the quadriceps and whether the knee torque is hereby affected. Transcutaneous FES of the right quadriceps of two paraplegic subjects was applied and measurements were made of the net torque and of the myoelectric activities of the quadriceps and hamstrings muscles of the right leg. A low correlation was obtained between the peak-to-peak amplitudes of the M-waves of the two muscles. This correlation decreased further with the development of fatigue, which indicated that the electromyography (EMG) signals from the hamstrings were not the result of cross-talk between adjacent recording sites. The force profile of each muscle was determined from a developed model incorporating EMG-based activation, muscle anthropometry as obtained from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of the thigh, and metabolic fatigue function, based on data acquired by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the muscle specific tension and the muscle moment arms have a major influence on the resulting muscle forces and should therefore be accurately provided. The results show that during the unfatigued phase of contraction the estimated maximal force in the hamstrings was lower than 20% of that in the quadriceps and could be considered to be practically negligible. As fatigue progressed the hamstrings-to-quadriceps force ratio increased, reaching up to 45%, and the effect of co-activation on the torque partition between the two muscles was no longer negligible.",2000,10,1,47-58,10.1016/s1050-6411(99)00016-4,#3047,Levin 2000,

Forty-eight college undergraduates were subjects. Frontal (forehead) electromyographic (EMG) responses were measured during baseline (no treatment), pretreatment, and test sessions. During pretreatment, subjects were assigned to one of three groups. Using a fictitious blood vessel control task, the success group received false feedback and instructions that conveyed that outcomes had been successfully controlled. The failure group received feedback and instructions that conveyed that outcomes had not been controlled. A control group was given no specific task. During the subsequent test stage, all subjects were asked to reduce frontal muscle tension levels through relaxation while assisted with true EMG feedback. Relative to the success and control groups. EMG levels of the failure group reflected more rapid acquisition of frontal muscle relaxation. However, performance on a cognitive task was not affected by the pretreatment. It was concluded that expectancies generated during the false feedback pretreatment were related to later biofeedback performance. The results were discussed in terms of concepts of locus of control and theories of learned helplessness and reactance.",1981,6,1,79-91,10.1007/BF00998796,#3048,Carlson 1981,

In humans, the effects of dietary creatine supplementation are controversial, with some studies showing increased muscle force and fatigue resistance and others reporting no effect on exercise performance. Little is known about the effects of creatine on muscle contractile properties. 2. Rats were fed a standard diet, creatine for 10 days or beta-guanidinopropionate, which depletes muscle creatine, for 7 days. Contractile properties were measured in isolated extensor digitorum longus and sternohyoid muscle as representative limb and upper airway dilator muscles, respectively. 3. Creatine had no effect on specific twitch and tetanic tension, contractile kinetics, twitch/tetanus tension ratio, the tension-frequency relationship or fatigue in both muscles. beta-Guanidinopropionate had no effect on the twitch and tetanic tension, contractile kinetics, twitch/tetanus tension ratio or tension-frequency relationship, but significantly increased (P < 0.05, anova) fatigue in both muscles. 4. Therefore, although creatine depletion increases fatigue, creatine loading has no effects on extensor digitorum longus and sternohyoid muscle contractile properties.",2002,29,10,885-90,10.1046/j.1440-1681.2002.03745.x,#3049,Gagnon 2002,

A secondary purpose was to compare the method error associated with maximal voluntary concentric and eccentric torque output over a range of testing velocities. 21 males (21-32 years) performed on two separate days maximal voluntary isometric, concentric and eccentric contractions of the quadriceps femoris at 4 isokinetic lever arm velocities of 0 degree.s-1 (isometric), 30 degrees.s-1, 120 degrees.s-1 and 270 degrees.s-1. Eccentric peak torque and angle-specific torques (measured every 10 degrees from 30 degrees to 70 degrees) did not significantly change from 0 degrees.s-1 to 270 degrees.s-1 (p greater than 0.005) with the exception of angle-specific 40 degrees torque, which significantly increased; p less than 0.05). The mean method error was significantly higher for the eccentric tests (10.6% +/- 1.6%) than for the concentric tests (8.1% +/- 1.7%) (p less than 0.05). The mean method error decreased slightly with increasing concentric velocity (p greater than 0.05), and increased slightly with increasing eccentric velocity (p greater than 0.05). A tension restricting neural mechanism, if active during maximal eccentric contractions, could possibly account for the large difference seen between the present eccentric torque-velocity results and the classic results obtained from isolated animal muscle.",1988,58,2-Jan,100-4,10.1007/BF00636611,#3050,Westing 1988,
371,35426864.0,The Rapid Screening for Somatosensory Tinnitus Tool: a Data-Driven Decision Tree Based on Specific Diagnostic Criteria.,Ear Hear,"BACKGROUND: Somatosensory or somatic tinnitus (ST) is a type of tinnitus where changes in somatosensory afference from the cervical spine or temporomandibular area alter the tinnitus perception. Very recently, the diagnostic value of a set of 16 diagnostic criteria for ST was determined. The next step in the development of easily applicable diagnostic criteria is to provide an uncomplicated model, based on the existing criteria, which can easily be used in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to construct an accurate decision tree, combining several diagnostic criteria, to optimize both sensitivity and specificity of ST diagnosis. DESIGN: An online survey was launched on the online forum Tinnitus Talk, managed by Tinnitus Hub in a convenience sample of participants with tinnitus. The survey included 42 questions, both on the presence of diagnostic criteria for ST and on other potentially influencing factors. A decision tree was constructed to classify participants with and without ST using the rpart package in R. Tree depth was optimized during a five-fold cross-validation. Finally, model performance was evaluated on a subset containing 20% of the original dataset. RESULTS: Data of 7981 participants were used to construct a decision tree for ST diagnosis. Four criteria were included in the final decision tree: 'Tinnitus and neck/jaw pain increase/decrease simultaneously', 'Tension in suboccipital muscles', 'Somatic modulation', and 'Bruxism'. The presented model has an accuracy of 82.2%, a sensitivity of 82.5%, and a specificity of 79%. Receiver operator characteristic curves demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.88. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a 42-item survey, a decision tree was created that was able to detect ST patients with high accuracy (82.2%) using only 4 questions. The RaSST is therefore expected to be easily implementable in clinical practice.",2022,43,5,1466-1471,10.1097/AUD.0000000000001224,#3051,Michiels 2022,

Twelve healthy subjects participated in this study. Electromyographic (EMG) activities from the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and gluteus maximus were recorded as subjects performed (a) standing hip extension with elastic resistance, (b) trunk flexion in single limb stance (diver), (c) standing split (glider), and (d) supine sliding bridge (slider). Baseline isometric knee flexor strength was measured at 90, 70, 50, and 30° of flexion at the knee with the subject seated and the hip flexed to 50° from horizontal. After completing the 4-week training program, strength tests were repeated. Repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to compare EMG activity between muscles and to assess angle-specific strength improvements. Hamstring activity exceeded gluteus maximus activity for resisted hip extension, glider, and slider exercises (p < 0.001) but not for the diver (p = 0.087). Hamstring activation was greatest during the slider and resisted hip extension and lowest during the glider and the diver. Knee flexor strength improved by 9.0% (p = 0.005) but was not angle specific (training by angle p = 0.874). The short-term home training program effectively targeted the hamstrings and resulted in strength gains that were similar at short and long muscle lengths. These data demonstrate that hamstring strength can be improved using eccentrically biased unilateral exercises without the use of weights or other equipments.",2015,29,3,772-8,10.1519/JSC.0000000000000666,#3052,Orishimo 2015,
373,21474701.0,Mechanical correction of dynamometer moment for the effects of segment motion during isometric knee-extension tests.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dynamometer and joint axis misalignment on measured isometric knee-extension moments using inverse dynamics based on the actual joint kinematic information derived from the real-time X-ray video and to compare the errors when the moments were calculated using measurements from external anatomical surface markers or obtained from the isokinetic dynamometer. Six healthy males participated in this study. They performed isometric contractions at 90° and 20° of knee flexion, gradually increasing to maximum effort. For the calculation of the actual knee-joint moment and the joint moment relative to the knee-joint center, determined using the external marker, two free body diagrams were used of the Cybex arm and the lower leg segment system. In the first free body diagram, the mean center of the circular profiles of the femoral epicondyles was used as the knee-joint center, whereas in the second diagram, the joint center was assumed to coincide with the external marker. Then, the calculated knee-joint moments were compared with those measured by the dynamometer. The results indicate that 1) the actual knee-joint moment was different from the dynamometer recorded moment (difference ranged between 1.9% and 4.3%) and the moment calculated using the skin marker (difference ranged between 2.5% and 3%), and 2) during isometric knee extension, the internal knee angle changed significantly from rest to the maximum contraction state by about 19°. Therefore, these differences cannot be neglected if the moment-knee-joint angle relationship or the muscle mechanical properties, such as length-tension relationship, need to be determined.",2011,111,1,68-74,10.1152/japplphysiol.00821.2010,#3053,Tsaopoulos 2011,
374,12446162.0,Change of carpal alignment under anaesthesia: role of physiological axial loading on carpus.,"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)","OBJECTIVE: to study the effect of physiological axial loading on the carpal alignment. DESIGN: Patients with distal radial fracture undergoing general anaesthesia for management of their injury were employed for the present study. The contralateral normal wrist was assessed for any change in carpal alignment following the elimination of the physiological axial load under anaesthesia with complete muscle relaxation. BACKGROUND: Axial load across the wrist is known to affect carpal alignment. Axial compression is known to dorsiflex the lunate due to its dorsally thinned wedge shape. However, cadaveric experiments have also shown the axial compression to flex the whole proximal carpal row. METHODS: Lateral radiographs of the uninjured wrist joint were performed in twenty patients with distal radial fracture. Radiographs were taken before and after giving general anaesthesia along with muscle relaxants and were repeated after applying the traction in line with the long axis of the radius. RESULTS: Anaesthesia caused scaphoid and lunate to dorsiflex with no change in scapholunate angle while, traction caused scaphoid to rotate further dorsally. CONCLUSIONS: Physiological axial loading due to the normal tone of the forearm muscles tends to flex the scaphoid and the lunate. This is contrary to the lunate's classical description of its tendency to dorsiflex under axial loading. Our results also failed to support the view that scapholunate interosseous ligament is in continuous tension due to the tendency of the scaphoid and lunate to move in the opposite directions. RELEVANCE: A dorsiflexed lunate need not be considered the hallmark for diagnosing the scapholunate dissociation.",2002,17,10-Sep,660-5,10.1016/s0268-0033(02)00110-9,#3054,Gupta 2002,
375,1855567.0,Mechanical load on the ventilatory muscles during an incremental cycle ergometer test.,Eur Respir J,"An incremental cycle ergometer test performed with a total of 40 healthy subjects (25 male, 15 female) was used to study the mechanical load on the ventilatory muscles. The parameters for the mechanical load on the ventilatory muscles are the time integral of the oesophageal pressure and the mean oesophageal pressure change per time unit (dPoe/dTI) of each breathing manoeuvre. The pressure-time integral is the area delimited by the oesophageal pressure trace and the inspiratory time axis. It is expressed as a fraction of the product of the subject's maximum oesophageal pressure (Poe(max)) and total breath cycle duration (TTOT). This parameter is called oesophageal tension time index (TTIoe). The relationship between minute ventilation and these two parameters during ergometer test showed gender-specific variations because of the differences between men and women as to anthropometric data, lung function parameters and maximum ventilatory muscle strength. Moreover, the dPoe/dTI values significantly depend on the breathing frequency. The present study has provided evidence that, in general, the TTIoe and dPoe/dTI values in terms of a specific minute ventilation (VE) are higher in women than in men. Parameters for the mechanical load on the ventilatory muscles regarding the level of pressure to be generated as well as the duration and velocity of muscle contraction should therefore also allow for the gender of the patients.",1991,4,4,385-92,,#3055,Wanke 1991,
376,30756467.0,"Active Trigger Points Are Associated With Anxiety and Widespread Pressure Pain Sensitivity in Women, but not Men, With Tension Type Headache.",Pain Pract,"BACKGROUND: A better understanding of gender differences can assist clinicians in further developing therapeutic programs in tension type headache (TTH). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate gender differences in the presence of trigger points (TrPs) in the head, neck, and shoulder muscles and their relationship with headache features, pressure pain sensitivity, and anxiety in people with TTH. METHODS: Two hundred and ten (59 men, 151 women) patients with TTH participated. TrPs were bilaterally explored in the temporalis, masseter, suboccipital, upper trapezius, splenius capitis, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Headache features were collected using a 4-week headache diary. Trait and state anxiety levels were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) over the temporalis, C5/C6 joint, second metacarpal, and tibialis anterior were assessed. RESULTS: Women with TTH exhibited a significantly higher number of total (P = 0.027) and active (P = 0.030), but similar number of latent (P = 0.461), TrPs than men with TTH. Active TrPs in the temporalis, suboccipital, and splenius capitis muscles were the most prevalent in both men and women with TTH. The number of active TrPs was associated with anxiety levels (r = 0.217; P = 0.045) in women, but not in men (P = 0.453): the higher the number of active TrPs, the more the trait levels of anxiety. Women exhibited lower PPTs than men (all, P < 0.001). In men, the number of active, but not latent, TrPs was negatively associated with localized PPTs (all, P < 0.05), whereas in women, the number of active and latent TrPs was negatively associated with PPTs in all points (all, P < 0.01): the higher the number of TrPs, the lower the widespread PPTs. CONCLUSIONS: This study described gender differences in the presence of TrPs in TTH. Women with TTH showed lower PPTs than men. The association between TrPs, anxiety levels, and pressure pain hyperalgesia seems to be more pronounced in women than in men with TTH.",2019,19,5,522-529,10.1111/papr.12775,#3056,CigarÃ¡n-MÃ©ndez 2019,gender
377,12869375.0,Myocardial oxygenation in isolated hearts predicted by an anatomically realistic microvascular transport model.,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,"An anatomically realistic model for oxygen transport in cardiac tissue is introduced for analyzing data measured from isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. The model is constructed to match the microvascular anatomy of cardiac tissue based on available morphometric data. Transport in the three-dimensional system (divided into distinct microvascular, interstitial, and parenchymal spaces) is simulated. The model is used to interpret experimental data on mean cardiac tissue myoglobin saturation and to reveal differences in tissue oxygenation between buffer-perfused and red blood cell-perfused isolated hearts. Interpretation of measured mean myoglobin saturation is strongly dependent on the oxygen content of the perfusate (e.g., red blood cell-containing vs. cell-free perfusate). Model calculations match experimental values of mean tissue myoglobin saturation, measured mean myoglobin, and venous oxygen tension and can be used to predict distributions of intracellular oxygen tension. Calculations reveal that approximately 20% of the tissue is hypoxic with an oxygen tension of <0.5 mmHg when the buffer is equilibrated with 95% oxygen to give an arterial oxygen tension of over 600 mmHg. The addition of red blood cells to give a hematocrit of only 5% prevents tissue hypoxia. It is incorrect to assume that the usual buffer-perfused Langendorff heart preparation is adequately oxygenated for flows in the range of < or =10 ml. min-1. ml tissue-1.",2003,285,5,H1826-36,10.1152/ajpheart.00380.2003,#3057,Beard 2003,

In the patients with NMD, this standard test gave one positive, six equivocal and 21 negative results. Compared with MH-related family patients, muscle bundles used had significantly smaller resting membrane potentials and smaller predrug twitch tension amplitudes. Some results from the group with NMD were obtained with muscles which were damaged, more rapidly deteriorating, non-standard or both, and should not be taken to indicate that the patients have the genetic trait for MH. The in vitro contracture test is not always relevant for myopathic muscle (especially dystrophic muscle) and this could explain the lack of specificity for MH.",1994,72,1,93-7,10.1093/bja/72.1.93,#3058,Adnet 1994,

Here, we investigate the direct contractile effects of erythropoietin on myocardial tissue. Treatment with EPO (50U/mL) using excitable murine and human left ventricular muscle preparations resulted in a 37% and 62% increase in twitch tension, respectively (P<0.05). Isolated murine cardiomyocytes exposed to EPO demonstrated a 41% increase in peak sarcomere shortening (P=0.012). Using compounds that specifically stimulate a non-erythropoietic EPO receptor yielded similar increases in contractile dynamics. Cardiomyocyte Ca(2+)dynamics showed an 18% increase in peak calcium in EPO treated cardiomyocytes over controls (P=0.03). Studies in muscle strips skinned after EPO treatment demonstrated a phosphorylation dependant increase in the viscous modulus as well as an increase in oscillatory work. The EPO mediated increase in peak sarcomere shortening was abrogated by PI3-K blockade via wortmannin and by non-isozyme specific PKC blockade by chelerythrine. Finally, EPO treatment resulted in an increase in PKCε in the particulate cellular fraction, indicating activation of this isoform. EPO exhibits direct positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in cardiomyocytes and ventricular muscle preparation. These effects are mediated through PI3-K and PKCε isoform signaling to directly affect both calcium release dynamics and myofilament function.",2012,52,1,256-63,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2011.10.005,#3059,Hefer 2012,
380,24321582.0,Correlation of the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) and Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) in patients with dysphonia.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: This study examines the correlation between two voice-specific patient-reported outcome measures: the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) and Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred four patients presenting to our voice clinic between May 2009 and August 2011. All patients completed the VHI-10 and V-RQOL in a single sitting. METHODS: Correlation between the two scales was examined using Spearman rank analysis. Calculated VHI-10 score was derived from V-RQOL score by direct conversion equation and compared with measured VHI-10 score. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were derived for diagnostic groups. RESULTS: Spearman correlation coefficient between the VHI-10 and V-RQOL was -0.91 (P < 0.0001). VHI-10 and V-RQOL scores were also significantly correlated among diagnostic categories. Calculated and measured VHI-10 scores were significantly different both for individuals and overall. Area under the curve (AUC) values from ROC curves were significantly different for the presbyphonia (V-RQOL AUC = 0.586 [standard error, SE ± 0.033]; VHI-10 AUC = 0.530 [SE ± 0.031]; P = 0.0014) and muscle tension dysphonia (V-RQOL AUC = 0.536 [SE ± 0.026]; VHI-10 AUC = 0.508 [SE ± 0.26]; P = 0.018) groups, with the V-RQOL showing relatively greater sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The VHI-10 and V-RQOL are highly correlated. However, VHI-10 score cannot be calculated from V-RQOL score using the tested equation. The V-RQOL may be more sensitive than the VHI-10 in detecting the impact of presbyphonia and muscle tension dysphonia.",2014,28,2,237-40,10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.07.015,#3060,Romak 2014,Dysphonia

382,25676737.0,Laryngeal manual therapy as a treatment for impaired production of tahrir vibrato in traditional Iranian singers.,Folia Phoniatr Logop,"BACKGROUND: Iranian vibrato (tahrir) is a common feature of traditional Iranian singing. A unique feature of tahrir is a modulated voice quality perceived as a rhythmic falsetto voice break associated with upward pitch inflections. Laryngeal discomfort and impaired voice quality can occur in singers when they perform Iranian tahrir using an improper technique. AIM: A case series research design was used to explore voice treatment outcomes using laryngeal manual therapy (LMT) for treating voice problems associated with tahrir singing. METHOD: Four professional Iranian singers of the traditional style (3 men and 1 woman) were studied. All subjects reported difficulty executing tahrir during performances. They were assessed by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) specializing in the administration of LMT for voice disorders. Multidimensional assessments were made of the participants' vocal function using acoustic and auditory-perceptual evaluation, self-reports of the singers, and LMT assessments by the SLP before and after treatment. The therapeutic program implemented LMT techniques to release laryngeal joints and reduce muscular tension. RESULTS: Pretreatment examination of the larynx and anterior neck musculature using palpation showed that the difficulties in producing tahrir vibrato were associated with a decreased thyrohyoid space and tension in the submental complex and sternocleidomastoid. Posttreatment examination showed an increased thyrohyoid space and reduced tension in the submental complex and sternocleidomastoid, associated with the singers' perception of reduced effort producing tahrir vibrato during singing. CONCLUSION: Tahrir vibrato requires specific training to prevent excessive tension in laryngeal and neck muscles. In the absence of such training, or in the context of excessive singing associated with fatigue, LMT may facilitate more efficient vocal production in tahrir singers.",2014,66,6,265-72,10.1159/000369063,#3062,Salehi 2014,

METHODS: From August 2011 to March 2012,60 patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain were divided into two groups (sliver needle group and TCM fumigation group) according to propotion of 1:1. In sliver needle group, there were 17 males and 13 females aged from 28 to 55 years old with an average age of (45.70 +/- 4.15), treated with sliver needle; In TCM fumigation group,there were 19 males and 11 females aged from 27 to 55 years old with an average age of (43.03 +/- 5.86), treated with TCM fumigation. Changes of force-displacement distance (FDD), specific absorption rate (S) of two groups were observed before treatment, 1 week and 3 months after treatment respectively, VAS scoring and Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ) were used to access clinical effects. RESULTS: (1) VAS score of silver needle group was 4.77 +/- 0.78, 1.99 +/- 1.08 and 2.55 +/- 0.94, respectively before treatment, at 1 week and 3 months after treatment,while VAS score in TCM fumigation group were 4.43 +/- 0.61, 2.48 +/- 0.71 and 3.05 +/- 0.86, respectively. VAS score of two groups after treatment were sigificant decrease than that of before treatment (P < 0.05). There was no sigificant differences between two groups before treatment, but sliver needle group performed well in analgesia than TCM fumigation group, and had obvious differences (P < 0.05). RMDQ score of silver needle group was 13.63 +/- 1.96, 5.87 +/- 2.33 and 6.53 +/- 2.89, respectively before treatment, at 1 week and 3 months after treatment, while RMDQ score in TCM fumigation group were 13.40 +/- 2.01, 6.90 +/- 2.31, 9.23 +/- 2.87, respectively. There was no significant differences between two groups before treatment and 1 week after treatment (P > 0.05), and had obvious differences between two groups at 3 months after treatment (P < 0.01). Both groups could obvious improve dysfunction caused by chronic low back pain, and curative effect of sliver needle groups was more endurable. (2) Following-up at 3 months after treatment, FDD of multifidus, erector spinae of effected side and multifidus of healthy in sliver needle group were obvious increased (P < 0.05); In TCM fumigation group, FDD of multifidus and erector spinae on both side were increased at 1 week after treatment (P < 0.05), but had no significant meaning at 3 months after treatment on health side (P>0.05). There was no significant meaning before treatment (P > 0.05), FDD of multifidus, erector spinae of effected side in sliver needle group were obvious increased at 1 week after treatment (P < 0.05); but no obvious meaning on health side. FDD of both side in sliver needle group were obvious increased at 3 months after treatment. (3) There was correlation among differences of FDD in multifidus and erector spinae, VAS score and differences of RMDQ, and Spearman correlation coefficient R was 0.517, 0.811, 0.746 and 0.625; There was correlation between items of soft tissue tension and sympotoms, function and life quality.

384,19574061.0,Biomechanical evaluation of distal biceps reconstruction with cortical button and interference screw fixation.,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,"HYPOTHESIS: Tension slide repair maintains the strength of the standard cortical button repair but reduces gap formation at the repair. Distal biceps tendon repair with a suspensory cortical button has yielded the strongest published repair, despite observed gap formation and tendon pistoning. The tension slide technique (TST) was described to reduce gap formation while maintaining the strength of cortical button repair. This study evaluates the biomechanics of the TST compared with previously described EndoButton (Smith & Nephew, Memphis, TN) repair and the TST with and without an interference screw. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used 20 matched specimens: 5 had a standard cortical button repair, and 5 had biceps repair with the TST. An additional 10 specimens underwent a TST, 5 with an interference screw and 5 without. All were cyclically loaded for 3600 cycles. Gap formation and load to failure were measured. RESULTS: The mean (SD) load to failure for standard technique was at 389 (148) N vs 432 (66) N for the TST (P = .28). The mean (SD) gap formation was 2.79 (1.43) mm with the standard repair and 1.26 (0.61) mm with the TST (P = .03). The mean (SD) load to failure with TST repair was 436 (103) N without the interference screw and 439 (94) N (P = 0.48) with the screw. The mean gap formation was 1.63 (1.09) mm without the screw and 1.45 (0.67) mm with the screw (P = .38.)

385,1878488.0,A comparison of contractile function between papillary muscles and isolated myocytes from the same human hearts.,Cardioscience,"The contractile function in response to increasing extracellular calcium and isoprenaline has been investigated using papillary muscles from seven human hearts (failing and non-failing) obtained at the time of transplant. Myocytes have been enzymatically isolated from adjacent myocardium, and their contractile characteristics measured in parallel to those of the intact papillary muscle. Similar experiments were performed on rabbit hearts, but in this case separate animals were used for the papillary muscles and cells. For human myocardium, the EC50 (concentration for half-maximal effect) for calcium, and the percentage increase in amplitude between basal (1.3mM) and maximally activating calcium, was similar between papillary muscle and cells. Variability of absolute responses was 4-5 times greater for papillary muscle than for myocytes. Isoprenaline accelerated the time to peak tension, time to 50% relaxation and time to 90% relaxation in papillary muscle; a similar effect on shortening was seen for time to peak tension and time to 50% relaxation in cells. Time to peak tension and time to 50% relaxation were not significantly different between the human preparations with isoprenaline, but the time to 50% relaxation with high calcium was faster for myocytes than for papillary muscle (p less than 0.05). Isoprenaline induced after-contractions in some cells, prolonging the time to 90% relaxation. This was not observed in papillary muscle preparations. Papillary muscles were less sensitive to the stimulatory effects of isoprenaline than cells taken from the same hearts. EC50 values were higher (p less than 0.05) and increases in contraction were lower (p less than 0.05) in whole tissue. This difference between cells and papillary muscle was not seen in rabbit hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1991,2,2,141-6,,#3065,Harding 1991,
386,8907130.0,Effects of calcium sensitizers on intracellular calcium handling and myocardial energetics.,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,"Calcium sensitizers may influence myocardial energetics by their action on calcium turnover and on crossbridge behavior. Using a myothermal method, the effects of the Ca2+ sensitizer EMD-53998 on calcium cycling, crossbridge behavior, and myocardial energy turnover were compared with the effects of an increase in extracellular calcium from 1.25 to 7.5 mM and with the effects of the catecholamine isoproterenol. All three inotropic interventions increased isometric force development in right ventricular rabbit papillary muscles. Relaxation time was decreased with isoproterenol, unchanged with high calcium, and increased with EMD 53998. Calcium cycling-related energy consumption, as measured by tension-independent heat, increased by 234% with high calcium, by 439% with isoproterenol, and by 77% with EMD 53998. In contrast to high calcium and isoproterenol, EMD 53998 increased economy of crossbridge cycling by increasing the force-time integral of the individual crossbridge cycle. The data indicate that EMD 53998 acts by phosphodiesterase inhibition and myofilament calcium sensitization. The latter effect is in part mediated by alteration of crossbridge behavior. Because of its effects on calcium cycling and crossbridge function myocardial energy turnover was reduced significantly with EMD 53998, whereas energy turnover was unchanged with high calcium and was increased with isoproterenol. The new calcium sensitizer levosimendan was investigated in isolated failing human myocardium. Levosimendan dose-dependently increased isometric tension. The inotropic effect was associated with increased rate of relaxation and reduced relaxation time. Measurements of intracellular calcium using the photoprotein aequorin suggest that levosimendan acts by increasing myofilament calcium sensitivity and by increasing cAMP due to phosphodiesterase inhibition. However, the contribution of the cAMP system to the action of levosimendan appears to be rather small. Therefore, the finding of a positive lusitropic effect of levosimendan may be consistent with the notion that levosimendan binds to troponin-C and increases calcium sensitivity only at high (systolic) intracellular calcium concentrations.",1995,26 Suppl 1,,S45-51,,#3066,Hasenfuss 1995,

SAMPLE: Eight asymptomatic subjects were tested bilaterally (N=16). METHODS: Myoelectric measurements - EMG signals were recorded with a 16 channel pocket EMG patient unit and processed off-line. Measurement of joint positions-three CCD adjustable cameras sensitive to 10mm reflective passive markers applied at specific locations on the subjects' bodies were used to reconstruct and verify accuracy of body movements and were correlated with EMG recordings. RESULTS: Compared with the standard (anatomical) position of the cervical spine in which Mills manipulation is typically performed, cervical spine ipsilateral lateral flexion produced significantly reduced activity in muscles that restrain the manipulation movement (elbow extension), namely biceps brachii (P=0.018) and brachioradialis (P=0.000). The affected muscles may therefore produce protective effects during the manipulation. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in myoelectric activity were in a pattern that suggests that muscle and neural mechanisms may be an integral part of the Mills manipulation. Cervical spine ipsilateral lateral flexion may be used to reduce mechanical stresses in the peripheral nerves and extraneous muscle activity, making Mills' manipulation potentially safer and more specific.",2012,22,3,363-9,10.1016/j.jelekin.2011.12.006,#3067,Rade 2012,
388,18254895.0,Predictor variables for identifying patients with chronic tension-type headache who are likely to achieve short-term success with muscle trigger point therapy.,Cephalalgia,"To date, no studies have investigated the predictive validity of variables from the initial examination to identify patients with tension-type headache pain who are likely to benefit from muscle trigger point (TrP) therapy. The purpose of this study was to develop a preliminary clinical prediction rule (CPR) to identify chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) patients who are likely to experience a successful response from TrP therapy. Consecutive patients with CTTH underwent a standardized examination and then received six sessions of TrP therapy over 3 weeks (two sessions per week). They were classified as having experienced a successful outcome at short-term (1 week after discharge) and 1-month follow-up based on a 50% reduction on at least one headache parameter (intensity, frequency or duration) and self-report perceived recovery. Potential predictor variables were entered into a stepwise logistic regression model to determine the most accurate set of variables for identifying treatment success. Data from 35 patients were included, of which 19 (55%) experienced a successful outcome. A CPR with four variables for short-term (headache duration < 8.5 h/day, headache frequency < 5.5 days/week, bodily pain < 47 and vitality < 47.5) and a CPR with two variables for 1-month (headache frequency < 5.5 days/week and bodily pain < 47) follow-up were identified. At short-term follow-up, if three of four variables [positive likelihood ratio (LR) 3.4] were present, the chance of experiencing a successful outcome improved from 54% to 80%, and if all the variables (positive LR 5.9) were present, the probability of success was 87.4%. At 1-month follow-up, if one of two variables (positive LR 2.2) was present, the probability of success increased from 54% to 72%, and if both variables (positive LR 4.6) were present, the probability of success was 84.4%.

389,11800567.0,Structural and functional studies of titin's fn3 modules reveal conserved surface patterns and binding to myosin S1--a possible role in the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart.,J Mol Biol,"The A-band part of titin, a striated-muscle specific protein spanning from the Z-line to the M-line, mainly consists of a well-ordered super-repeat array of immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin-type III (fn3)-like domains. Since it has been suspected that the fn3 domains might represent titin's binding sites to myosin, we have developed structural models for all of titin's 132 fn3-like domains. A subset of eight experimentally determined fn3 structures from a range of proteins, including titin itself, was used as homology templates. After grouping the models according to their position within the super-repeat segment of the central A-band titin region, we analyzed the models with respect to side-chain conservation. This showed that conserved residues form an extensive surface pattern predominantly at one side of the domains, whereas domains outside the central C-zone super-repeat region show generally less conserved surfaces. Since the conserved surface residues may function as protein-binding sites, we experimentally studied the binding properties of expressed multi-domain fn3 fragments. This revealed that fn3 fragments specifically bind to the sub-fragment 1 of myosin. We also measured the effect of fn3 fragments on the contractile properties of single cardiac myocytes. At sub-maximal Ca(2+) concentrations, fn3 fragments significantly enhance active tension. This effect is most pronounced at short sarcomere length, and as a result the length-dependence of Ca(2+) activation is reduced. A model of how titin's fn3-like domains may influence actomyosin interaction is proposed.",2001,313,2,431-47,10.1006/jmbi.2001.5017,#3069,Muhle-Goll 2001,
390,19099241.0,"Evidence that a maternal ""junk food"" diet during pregnancy and lactation can reduce muscle force in offspring.",Eur J Nutr,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a multi-factorial condition generally attributed to an unbalanced diet and lack of exercise. Recent evidence suggests that maternal malnutrition during pregnancy and lactation can also contribute to the development of obesity in offspring. We have developed an animal model in rats to examine the effects of maternal overeating on a westernized ""junk food"" diet using palatable processed foods rich in fat, sugar and salt designed for human consumption. Using this model, we have shown that such a maternal diet can promote overeating and a greater preference for junk food in offspring at the end of adolescence. The maternal junk food diet also promoted adiposity and muscle atrophy at weaning. Impaired muscle development may permanently affect the function of this tissue including its ability to generate force. AIMS: The aim of this study is to determine whether a maternal junk food diet can impair muscle force generation in offspring. METHODS: Twitch and tetanic tensions were measured in offspring fed either chow alone (C) or with a junk food diet (J) during gestation, lactation and/or post-weaning up to the end of adolescence such that three groups of offspring were used, namely the CCC, JJC and JJJ groups. RESULTS: We show that adult offspring from mothers fed the junk food diet in pregnancy and lactation display reduced muscle force (both specific twitch and tetanic tensions) regardless of the post-weaning diet compared with offspring from mothers fed a balanced diet. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal malnutrition can influence muscle force production in offspring which may affect an individual's ability to exercise and thereby combat obesity.",2009,48,1,62-5,10.1007/s00394-008-0760-5,#3070,Bayol 2009,

Part 1: Subjects with single headaches.,Cephalalgia,"Musculoskeletal disorders are considered the underlying cause of cervicogenic headache, but neck pain is commonly associated with migraine and tension-type headaches.

From a group of 196 community-based volunteers with headache, 73 had a single headache classifiable as migraine (n = 22), tension-type (n = 33) or cervicogenic headache (n = 18); 57 subjects acted as controls. Range of movement, manual examination of cervical segments, cervical flexor and extensor strength, the cranio-cervical flexion test (CCFT), cross-sectional area of selected extensor muscles at C2 (ultrasound imaging) and cervical kinaesthetic sense were measured by a blinded examiner. In all but one measure (kinaesthetic sense), the cervicogenic headache group were significantly different from the migraine, tension-type headache and control groups (all P < 0.001). A discriminant function analysis revealed that collectively, restricted movement, in association with palpable upper cervical joint dysfunction and impairment in the CCFT, had 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity to identify cervicogenic headache. There was no evidence that the cervical musculoskeletal impairments assessed in this study were present in the migraine and tension-type headache groups.

Patients were classified by age, sex, education and professional background, frequency of complaints of pain, occlusal relationships, oral habits, and specific muscles that were tender on palpation. A coincidence of stress and tension and the onset of myofascial pain was observed. It is suggested that myofascial pain may be more common in women than in men.

The right and left legs of 8 male and 8 female subjects were tested at rest and during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Joint angles were chosen to control muscle tendon lengths so that the muscles were near their optimal length within the length-tension relationship. No differences in pennation angle were detected between the right and left legs. Another consistent finding was that the pennation angle at MVC was significantly greater than at rest for all muscles tested. Optimal pennation angles for the TA, MG, and Sol were significantly greater for the men than for the women. Optimal pennation angles for the TA, LG, MG, and Sol for the male subjects were 14.3 degrees, 23.7 degrees, 34.6 degrees, and 40.1 degrees respectively, whereas values of 12.1 degrees, 16.3 degrees, 27.3 degrees, and 26.3 degrees were recorded for the female subjects. The results of this study suggest the following: (1) similar values for pennation angle can be used for the right and left TA, LG, MG, and Sol; (2) pennation angle is significantly greater at MVC than at rest for all muscles tested; and (3) sex-specific values for optimal pennation angle should be used when modeling the force-generating potential of the primary muscles responsible for ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.",2006,22,4,255-63,10.1123/jab.22.4.255,#3073,Manal 2006,

Specifically, strength training was employed to examine the effects on mood and anxiety in a group of healthy but sedentary older women. 36 women (mean age = 68.5 yr.) were randomly assigned to groups given high intensity or moderate intensity strength training or to a control group. Strength training was conducted three days a week for 12 weeks. After the training period, both high and moderate strength-training programs produced marked improvements in muscle strength and body composition compared to the control subjects. The average improvements in the high and moderate intensity strength-training groups for muscle strength were 40.5 and 35.5%, respectively, and for percent body fat 1.52 and 2.50%, respectively. As for psychological changes, both training groups significantly improved positive mood (vigor), and the moderate intensity group significantly reduced trait anxiety compared to means of the control group. Also, both training groups showed some decrease in tension and state anxiety after the training period. These findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of anaerobic training to enhance perception of psychological well-being in older women. A moderate intensity rather than high intensity of training regimen may be more beneficial for sedentary older women to improve psychological health.",1998,87,3 Pt 1,1003-11,10.2466/pms.1998.87.3.1003,#3076,Tsutsumi 1998,
397,1420227.0,A new skeletal muscle linear-pull energy convertor as a power source for prosthetic circulatory support devices [corrected].,J Heart Lung Transplant,"Previous studies show that stimulated skeletal muscle wrapped around the heart or a blood pumping pouch can provide partial circulatory assistance. However, skeletal muscle is accustomed to pulling in direct tension, and power obtained from using the muscle in wraparound configurations is very inefficient. Therefore we have developed a new skeletal muscle-powered, linear-pull energy convertor for powering a wide range of implanted devices, including circulatory support blood pumps such as counterpulsation devices or complete prosthetic ventricles. This energy convertor system is powered by a skeletal muscle such as the latissimus dorsi, which is stimulated with a pulse generator. With the muscle left intact and in situ as much as possible, its insertion at the humerus is removed and reattached to a small-cylinder hydraulic energy convertor that is firmly attached to the ribs. Mechanical force in direct tension from the muscle is converted to high-pressure, low displacement; hydraulic energy (at approximately 200 psi). The output of this hydraulic energy convertor is connected by a small-diameter tube to a hydraulic actuator to drive the pusher plate of an implantable ventricular assist device located in the thoracic cavity or abdomen or another suitable blood pump. Preliminary in vitro tests from an engineering model of the Thoratec muscle-powered ventricular assist device show flow outputs of 5.2 L/min at a mean arterial pressure of 99 mm Hg. The muscle-powered ventricular assist device is a specific application designed to provide completely implantable circulatory support as an alternative to heart transplantation. It will enable patients to experience a quality of life free from batteries and the electrical power-conditioning hardware required with electromechanical systems.",1992,11,5,S341-50,,#3077,Farrar 1992,
398,15098664.0,"Gene transfer of troponin I isoforms, mutants, and chimeras.",Adv Exp Med Biol,"Thin filament proteins play an essential role in the regulation of myocardial pressure development. Within the thin filament of the sarcomere, troponin I (TnI) plays a key role in regulating the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force. During myocardial development, there is a transition in TnI isoform expression from the slow skeletal isoform (ssTnI) in embryonic/fetal myocardium to the cardiac isoform (cTnI) expressed in adult hearts. Over a similar developmental time window, the calcium sensitivity of force development also decreases. Gene transfer of ssTnI, and chimeras derived from ssTnI and cTnI, into adult ventricular myocytes have provided insights into the isoform-specific domains of TnI responsible for differentially influencing myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. Two separate isoform-specific regions, located in the carboxyl- and amino-portions of the protein, have been identified by comparing Ca(2+)-activated isometric tension in myocytes expressing the TnI isoforms or chimeras. The carboxyl-portion of TnI also contributes to isoform-dependent differences in myofilament sensitivity to acidic pH, which ensues during several myocardial disease states. In contrast, the diminished Ca(2+) sensitivity observed in response to beta-adrenergic-mediated phosphorylation of cardiac TnI requires the amino-portion of the cardiac TnI isoform yet, does not depend on the presence of a specific isoform in the carboxyl-region of TnI. Recent studies with a mutation linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have demonstrated that changes in protein charge also influence the ability of TnI isoforms to regulate myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. Information gained from these, and future studies on more localized and specific changes in the amino acid sequence, may one day lead to the use of genetically engineered TnI for therapeutic manipulation of contractile function.",2003,538,,169-74; discussion 174,10.1007/978-1-4419-9029-7_15,#3078,Westfall 2003,

In this study, we sought to establish better define normal values by measurement of TwQ in 45 normal subjects. Supramaximal stimulation, as judged by TwQ, was achieved in 43 of 45 subjects at a mean of 90% of maximum stimulator output. The mean TwQ was 7.3 kilograms force (kgf) (SD 2.3) for women and 9.8 kgf (SD 2.5) for men. The mean maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force was 48.0 kgf (SD 9.2) for women and 70.1 kgf (15.2) for men. The mean TwQ/MVC ratio was 0.15 for both women and men. Significant correlations were observed between TwQ and weight (r = 0.33, P<0.03) and height (r = 0.32, P<0.03) but these were weak and only partially explained observed variance.

Parameters including arterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests, respiratory muscle force, neuromuscular drive, and nutritional status were recorded during a phase of clinical stability, in order to identify the features related to survival and weaning. All the patients were submitted to a comprehensive rehabilitation programme. Successful weaning from MV was defined as complete respiratory autonomy for at least 48 h. Twenty three patients were successfully weaned from MV after an average period of 44 days (Group A), requiring no further MV during their stay in hospital, whilst the remaining 19 patients were not able to be disconnected from the ventilator (Group B). The discriminant analysis showed that weaning from MV was significantly associated with arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), neuromuscular drive (P0.1), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT) and the serum protein level. Other pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), anthropometric data, nutritional status, number of pulmonary exacerbations during MV and evidence of cor pulmonale, were similar in the two groups. The discriminant equation considering PaCO2 and MIP could separate the two groups with an accuracy of 84%.

402,7599826.0,Ventilatory response to arm elevation. Its determinants and use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,"During arm elevation, normal individuals predominantly recruit the diaphragm, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients use more the accessory inspiratory and abdominal expiratory muscles. To test that arm elevation is useful to study the ventilatory muscle response in COPD, and to define the factors that determine this response, we studied 34 patients (FEV1 0.95 +/- 0.08 L) during 2 min of arm elevation. Transnasal balloons were used to determine end-inspiratory and end-expiratory gastric (Pg), pleural (Ppl) and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressures. The slope of delta Pg/delta Ppl (= Pgi - Pge/Ppli - Pple) was used to infer respiratory muscle recruitment. With linear regression, the delta Pg/delta Ppl during arm elevation significantly correlated with resting delta Pg/delta Ppl (r = 0.68), hyperinflation (FRC/TLC, r = 0.52), and diaphragmatic tension time index (TTIdi) (r = 0.47). With multiple regression, resting delta Pg/delta Ppl, percentage predicted FRC (FRC %pred) and TTIdi influenced delta Pg/delta Ppl during arm elevation (r = 0.84). Over the 2 min of arm elevation, the dependency upon resting breathing pattern decreased, while hyperinflation and TTIdi became increasingly important. Higher resting TTIdi values were associated with a faster and shallower breathing pattern (f/VT > or = 38) during arm elevation. We conclude that the pattern of respiratory muscle recruitment during arm elevation depends primarily on the resting breathing pattern. Over 2 min, the degree of hyperinflation and the force reserve of the diaphragm increasingly impact on the ability to recruit the diaphragm. Measurement of f/VT during arm elevation is useful to determine functional reserve of the diaphragm in severe COPD.",1995,152,1,211-6,10.1164/ajrccm.152.1.7599826,#3082,Epstein 1995,

In this study, female rabbits were treated with anabolic steroid (nandrolone decanoate) or arachis oil placebo for 4 weeks or 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, tibialis anterior muscles of treated animals showed highly significant increases in wet weight (38%), twitch tension (66%), maximum isometric tetanic tension (48%), maximum cross-sectional area (27%), and specific tension (17%). Fiber type composition showed a significant trend toward a less oxidative metabolic character. The experiments provided clear physiological and morphological evidence of a steroid-induced hypertrophy that was not attributable to fluid retention or changes in body weight. Of the muscles examined, the myotrophic effect was confined to the tibialis anterior muscle; extensor digitorum longus, plantaris, and soleus muscles showed no significant response.

In these patients, the results of clinical tests and instrumented laxity tests without anesthesia prior to the arthroscopy were analyzed. The Lachman test and the maximum anterior pull (150-200 N) KT-1000 instrumented test revealed abnormal laxity in 33 and 37 of 42 cases, respectively. Both tests revealed abnormal laxity more often than the KT-1000 test using 67 N (10/42) and the maximum anterior pull KT-1000 instrumented test also revealed abnormal laxity more often than the KT-1000 test using 89 N (25/42). By logistic regression analysis, the maximum anterior pull KT-1000 instrumented test was associated with rupture of the ACL (partial or total rupture). The results show that adequate anterior pull has to be used to overcome muscle tension to reveal abnormal laxity in acute ACL tears using the KT-1000 arthrometer.",1995,16,1,51-3,10.1055/s-2007-972963,#3084,Strand 1995,
405,11160038.0,Maximal instantaneous muscular power after prolonged bed rest in humans.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"A reduction in lower limb cross-sectional area (CSA) occurs after bed rest (BR). This should lead to an equivalent reduction in maximal instantaneous muscular power (W(p)) if the body segments' lengths remain unchanged. W(p) was determined during maximal jumps off both feet on a force platform before and on days 2, 6, 10, 32, and 48 after a 42-day duration BR. CSA of thigh muscles was measured by magnetic resonance imaging before and on day 5 after BR. Before BR, W(p) was 3.63 +/- 0.43 kW or 48.6 +/- 3.3 W/kg. On days 2 and 6 after BR, W(p) was reduced by 23.7 +/- 6.9 and 22.7 +/- 5.4% (P < 0.01), respectively. Thigh extensors CSA (CSAEXT) was 16.7 +/- 4.7% (P < 0.01) lower than before. When normalized per CSAEXT, W(p) was reduced by only 4.8 +/- 4.5% (P < 0.05). By day 48 of recovery, W(p) had returned to baseline values. Therefore, if W(p) is appropriately normalized for CSA of the extensor muscles, the reduction in CSAEXT explains most of the decrease in W(p) decrease after BR. Other factors such as a deficit in neural activation or a decrease in fiber-specific tension may account for only 5% of the W(p) loss after BR.",2001,90,2,431-5,10.1152/jappl.2001.90.2.431,#3085,Ferretti 2001,

We wanted to compare muscle activity and pain development during and after low-grade mental stress in FMS and SNP patients. Twenty-three women with FMS, 29 women with chronic SNP and 35 healthy women performed a stressful task lasting 60 min followed by a 30 min recovery period. We recorded surface electromyography over the trapezius, neck, temporalis and frontalis muscles. Subjects reported their pain at the corresponding locations together with the development of fatigue and perceived tension. Significant differences between FMS and SNP groups were not observed either for muscular or subjective responses. SNP patients and controls responded with more pain in the trapezius and neck regions than in the forehead, in contrast to FMS patients who had a more generalized pain response. Development of pain, tension and fatigue was not related to muscle activity for any group. We conclude that FMS and SNP patients have similar pain and electromyographic responses. The results suggest that similar pathophysiological mechanisms are involved although the responses are more generalised in FMS than in SNP patients. Muscular activity did not explain the pain which developed during the stressful task for either group. Pain lasted longer during recovery in both FMS and SNP patients compared to healthy controls, possibly a result of disease-related sensitisation in pain pathways.",2006,10,7,615-27,10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.10.001,#3086,Nilsen 2006,

Further evidence in support of the specificity of the facial muscle-pulmonary relationship was provided in the present study by monitoring changes in several responses as a function of muscle tension training. Feedback training for increases and decreases in muscle tension at both facial and limb muscle sites was given to adult males. The effects of these manipulations on PEFR, RR, and HR were examined. Increases in facial muscle tension resulted in PEFR decreases whereas increases in limb muscle tension did not. Decreases in facial muscle tension were not observed as a function of training and no PEFR changes resulted from these conditions. Neither RR nor HR were related to the facial EMG changes observed during feedback training. These observations demonstrated the specificity inherent in the relationship between facial muscle tension and PEFR, and lent support to the hypothesis that these two responses are linked reflexively.",1984,18,1,10-Mar,10.1016/0301-0511(84)90021-8,#3087,Harver 1984,

Ginanneschi et al. (2005)Exp. Brain Res., 161, 374--382]. The present study examined force estimation under conditions in which the input--output relationship of the corticospinal innervation to ADM was modified by changing shoulder position as above. The input--output relationship was studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Estimates of force were assessed using a matching procedure; subjects first matched a target level (10--40% of maximum) on a screen by applying a reference (Ref) isometric contraction of ADM and then they reproduced the same level of force without visual feedback by a test contraction (Test). When Ref and Test contractions were performed at either ANT or POST (i.e. the same input--output), the respective force levels were closely matched. In contrast, when the Test and Ref were performed in POST and ANT, respectively (i.e. different input--output), subjects exerted more force than required. Errors were in the opposite direction when the Test and Ref were in ANT and POST, respectively. The present results suggest that the process of force estimation is based on the effort : tension ratio which is a direct function of the corticomotoneuronal input--output relationship. This notion may contribute to explaining the pathophysiology of central fatigue.",2005,22,5,1127-34,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04287.x,#3088,Gelli 2005,

DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 118 consecutive adult patients with a diagnosis of neuromuscular disease who underwent phrenic nerve conduction studies during a 5-year period, and we analyzed pulmonary function data for 8 patients who underwent arterial blood gas studies before and after the administration of low-flow oxygen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the eight patients with neuromuscular disease and diaphragmatic dysfunction (three with polymyositis, three with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or nonspecific motor neuron disease, and one each with inflammatory motor neuropathy and chronic poliomyelitis), we analyzed the response of the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) after low-flow supplemental oxygen therapy (0.5 to 2 L/min). Linear analysis was used to attempt to find correlations between respiratory variables and the PaCO2 response after oxygen therapy. RESULTS: For the overall study group, the mean PaCO2 increased 28.2 +/- 23.3 torr after low-flow oxygen treatment; in five patients, it increased by 27 torr or more. Four patients who were subsequently treated with nocturnal assisted ventilation were able to use supplemental oxygen during the day with less severe hypercapnia. Statistical analysis failed to reveal specific correlations between increased PaCO2 values after oxygen therapy and any respiratory variables. CONCLUSION: In patients with neuromuscular disease and diaphragmatic dysfunction, even low-flow supplemental oxygen should be administered with caution, and assisted ventilation should be strongly considered as an initial intervention.",1995,70,4,327-30,10.4065/70.4.327,#3090,Gay 1995,

First part: anatomical study.,Morphologie,"We examined 30 upper limbs in order to study the tendinous muscular insertions into the deep fascia and to verify whether they have a specific anatomical arrangement and to measure their resilience to traction. We have found that the fascia receives many tendinous muscular insertions, which are always present and exhibit a constant anatomical structure. In particular, the pectoralis major fascia always continues with the brachial fascia in two distinct ways: the fascia overlying the clavicular part of pectoralis major had an expansion towards the anterior brachial fascia, whereas the fascia covering its costal part extended into the medial brachial fascia and the medial intermuscular septum. The lacertus fibrosus was also composed by two groups of fibres: the main group was oriented downwards and medially, the second group longitudinally. The palmaris longus opened out into a fan-shape in the palm of the hand and sent some tendinous expansions to the flexor retinaculum and fascia overlying the thenar eminence muscles. In the posterior region of the arm, the fascia of the latissimus dorsi sent a fibrous lamina to the triceps brachial fascia. The triceps tendon inserted partially into the antebrachial fascia, while the extensor carpi ulnaris sent a tendinous expansion to the fascia of the hypothenar eminence. It is hypothesized that the tendinous muscular insertions maintain the fascia at a basal tension and create myofascial continuity between the different muscles actuating flexion and extension of the upper limb, stretching the fascia in different ways according to the different motor directions.",2007,91,292,29-37,10.1016/j.morpho.2007.05.001,#3091,Stecco 2007,

Twenty-eight patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) with left to right shunt and PH, 29 patients with CHD with left to right shunt but without PH, and 18 healthy children, in total 75 individuals, were included in the study. All cases were aged between 4 and 36 months. Echocardiographic evaluation was performed in all cases, and invasive hemodynamic investigation was performed in 33 cases. Blood samples were obtained from all cases, for the measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), sensitive cardiac troponin I (scTnI), and high-sensitive troponin T (hscTnT) levels. The mean BNP, pro-BNP, scTnI, and hsTnT levels were statistically significantly higher in patients with PH than in the patients without PH (p < 0.001). A statistically significant positive correlation was determined between pulmonary artery systolic pressure and scTnI and hscTnT levels (r = 0.34 p = 0.01, r = 0.46 p < 0.001, respectively) levels. Pulmonary hypertension determined in congenital heart diseases triggers myocardial damage independently of increased volume or pressure load and resistance, occurring by disrupting the perfusion via increasing ventricular wall tension and the myocardial oxygen requirement.

Significant difference in the mean caffeine sensitivity was found between type I masseter fibers [2.57 +/- 1.32 (SD) mM] vs. type I (6.02 +/- 1.74 mM) and type II vastus lateralis fibers (11.25 +/- 3.13 mM). Maximal Ca(2+)-activated force per cross-sectional area was significantly different between masseter and vastus lateralis fibers. However, the Ca2+ concentration corresponding to half-maximal tension (pCa50) was not significantly different between type I masseter (pCa50 5.9 +/- 0.02) and type I vastus lateralis muscle (pCa50 6.01 +/- 0.08). These results suggest that the increase in caffeine sensitivity of masseter muscle reflects the presence of a low reactivity threshold of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.",1996,80,5,1547-53,10.1152/jappl.1996.80.5.1547,#3093,Adnet 1996,
414,19560944.0,Suture anchor loading after rotator cuff repair: effects of an additional lateral row.,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,"HYPOTHESIS: Our initial hypothesis was that the medial row of double-row rotator cuff repair techniques would bear most of the load on the repaired cuff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six cadaver shoulders underwent simulated rotator cuff repairs using sequential single row, double-row, and suture-bridge repair techniques. Suture tensions at each anchor were measured for several static, simulated shoulder positions by specially designed, instrumented anchors. RESULTS: Significantly greater suture tensions were measured in the anchors in a single row repair construct than either the double row repair or suture bridge repair construct (P < .001). In the double-row and suture bridge techniques, there was no apparent difference in the loads born by the medial and lateral row anchors. Shoulder abduction from 45 degrees to 60 degrees had little effect on anchor tensions; 45 degrees internal and external rotation significantly (P = .032) increased loads on the anterior and posterior anchors by at least 125%. DISCUSSION: Forces are transmitted through the entire portion of the tendon at its humeral fixation, loading the lateral anchors as well as the medial row for the techniques studied. This ""load sharing"" can explain the higher fixation strengths of double row techniques seen experimentally. CONCLUSION: The magnitude and distribution of anchor suture tensions could have important implications for lateral row fixation devices and post-operative positioning and activity.

415,12842512.0,Contractions in human coronary bypass vessels stimulated by extracellular nucleotides.,Ann Thorac Surg,"BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to evaluate the relative contribution of different contractile P2 receptors in human saphenous vein compared with internal mammary artery obtained during coronary artery surgery. METHODS: The isometric tension in endothelium-denuded isolated vessel segments was recorded in vitro. The P2 receptor mRNA expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The P2X(1) receptor agonist, alphabeta-MeATP (alphabeta-methylene-adenosine triphosphate), was the most potent vasoconstrictor, with more efficacious contractions in the saphenous vein than in the internal mammary artery. The selective P2Y(6) receptor agonist, UDPbetaS (uridine 5'-O-thiodiphosphate), stimulated more potent contractions in saphenous vein compared with internal mammary artery. Furthermore, UDPbetaS induced long-lasting contractions for more than 2 hours, explained by the low desensitization rate of the P2Y(6) receptor. The ATP-induced vasoconstriction could not be abolished by desensitization of P2X(1) receptors with alphabeta-MeATP, or P2Y(2/4) receptors with UTPgammaS (uridine 5'-O-3-thiotriphosphate), indicating the presence of yet another contractile ATP receptor. Based on quantification with real-time polymerase chain reaction, the P2Y(11) receptor could be responsible for this ATP contraction. CONCLUSIONS: The P2X(1) and P2Y(6) receptors elicit more prominent contractions in the saphenous vein as compared with the internal mammary artery. These results may present one explanation for the differences in the two conduits. It is possible that selective antagonists of P2X(1) and P2Y(6) receptors could be used to prevent vasospasm and restenosis in the saphenous vein during and after revascularization surgery.",2003,76,1,50-7,10.1016/s0003-4975(03)00008-0,#3095,Borna 2003,
416,19699975.0,Minimally invasive measurement of esophageal variceal pressure and wall tension (with video).,Gastrointest Endosc,"BACKGROUND: There is no simple method to measure intravariceal pressure in patients with esophageal varices. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to develop a new noninvasive technique to measure resting intravariceal pressure and wall tension. DESIGN: A model was developed. A long balloon (varix) was fitted inside an airtight cylinder (esophagus). Fluid ran through the model varices to maintain 5 different constant pressures. An endoscope was placed in the model esophagus, and pressure was increased by air insufflation. The endoscopy and pressure readings from the esophagus and varix were recorded continuously until variceal collapse. SETTING: Patient studies were done in an endoscopy suite with the patient under fentanyl and midazolam sedation. PATIENTS: Esophageal pressure was measured during air insufflation in patients with varices until the varices collapsed. EUS was used to measure radius and wall thickness to calculate wall tension. RESULTS: In the varix model, the mean (SD) intraluminal esophageal pressures at variceal flattening for the model varices at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mm Hg were 5.69 (0.34), 11 (0.32), 15.72 (0.51), 21.55 (0.63), and 25.8 (0.14) mm Hg. The correlation between actual and measured variceal pressure in the model at variceal flattening was r = 0.98. In the patients, a total of 10 varices in 3 patients were evaluated. The mean (SD) for the varices in each subject was 12.16 (2.4), 23.2 (1.3), and 6.5 (2.2) mm Hg for subjects 1, 2, and 3, respectively. CONCLUSION: Standard endoscopy with air insufflation and manometry can be used as an accurate, simple, and reproducible method to measure intravariceal pressure.",2009,70,3,407-13,10.1016/j.gie.2008.11.033,#3096,Vegesna 2009,

A group of 22 COPD patients and 10 healthy control subjects were studied. In COPD patients, vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) were reduced to 79% and 51%, respectively. Diffusion indices (transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TL,CO) and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO)) were also reduced. Arterial oxygen tension (Pa,O2) was normal or slightly altered. A maximal exercise test was performed and anaerobic threshold was calculated. Muscle samples from vastus lateralis were obtained by needle biopsy. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) and light chain (MLC) isoforms were separated by gel electrophoresis and quantified by densitometry. MHC isoforms were considered as molecular markers of fibre types. The proportion of the fast MHC-2B isoform was increased in COPD patients. TL,CO, KCO, VC and FEV1 were positively correlated with slow MHC isoform content. TL,CO and KCO were also negatively correlated with the content of the fast MHC-2B isoform. No correlation was found between exercise parameters and MHC isoform composition. The co-ordinated expression between MHC and MLC isoforms was altered in COPD patients. We conclude that reduced oxygen availability, probably in combination with muscle disuse, may determine muscle alterations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. The altered correlations between myosin heavy chain and light chain isoforms suggest that co-ordinated protein expression is lost in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease muscles.",1997,10,12,2853-60,10.1183/09031936.97.10122853,#3097,Satta 1997,
418,15362271.0,Intramyocardial oxygen monitoring in coronary artery bypass surgery.,J Clin Monit Comput,"OBJECTIVE: In coronary artery bypass surgery various parameters have been used to monitor patients clinical status. Direct monitoring of myocardial oxygenation can be performed by measuring intramyocardial partial oxygen tension pressure (p ti O2). This study was performed to determine the perioperative time course of this parameter in correlation to standard monitoring parameters. METHODS: Twenty-three patients underwent standard coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A special polarographic microprobes was inserted into the myocardium in the distribution zone of the left anterior descending artery which was one of the target vessels of myocardial revascularization. Intramyocardial p ti O2 was monitored intra- and up to 12 hours postoperatively. Values were correlated to hemodynamic, oxygenation and procedure associated parameters. RESULTS: Myocardial oxygenation during CABG is characterized by a significant decrease of p ti O2 during cross-clamping and a significant increase after removal of the cross-clamp. The postoperative time course of p ti O2 shows a steady increase of p ti O2 in the first 12 postoperative hours investigated. Preoperative ejection fraction as well as cardio-pulmonary bypass time does not seem to have an influence on the postoperative p ti O2 in these patients. Various standard monitoring parameters show complex influence on intramyocardial p ti O2- CONCLUSIONS: Determination of intramyocardial partial oxygen pressure in patients undergoing bypass surgery shows characteristic changes. Changes in p ti O2 as a direct online parameter of myocardial oxygenation occur immediately after procedures that influence myocardial perfusion and therefore, may help to detect potential complications earlier than standard monitoring parameters in cardiac surgery.",2004,18,2,93-101,10.1023/b:jocm.0000032697.95793.44,#3098,Misfeld 2004,
419,10779107.0,Adaptive neural network control of cyclic movements using functional neuromuscular stimulation.,IEEE Trans Rehabil Eng,"In this study, we evaluated the performance of an adaptive feedforward controller and its ability to automatically develop and customize stimulation patterns for use in functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) systems. Results from previous experiments using the pattern generator/pattern shaper (PG/PS) controller to generate isometric contractions demonstrated its ability to adjust stimulation patterns to account for recruitment nonlinearities and muscle dynamics. In this study, the PG/PS controller was tested under isotonic conditions. This evaluation required the PG/PS controller to account for muscle length-tension and force-velocity properties as well as limb dynamics. The performance of the adaptive controller was also compared with that of a proportional-derivative (PD) feedback controller. The PG/PS controller is composed of a neural network system that adaptively filters a periodic signal to produce a muscle stimulation pattern for generating cyclic movements. We used computer-simulated models to determine controller parameters for the PG/PS and PD controller that perform well across a variety of musculoskeletal systems. The controllers were then experimentally evaluated on both legs of two subjects with spinal cord injury. Results indicated that the PG/PS controller was able to achieve and maintain better tracking performance than the PD controller. This study indicates that the PG/PS control system may provide an effective mechanism for automatically customizing stimulation patterns for individuals using FNS systems.",2000,8,1,42-52,10.1109/86.830948,#3099,Riess 2000,
420,11912453.0,Potassium channel KV alpha1 subunit expression and function in human detrusor muscle.,J Urol,"PURPOSE: We determined whether voltage gated K+ (KV) channels are expressed and functional in human detrusor smooth muscle MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on KV channels was obtained using electrophysiological patch clamp, immunofluorescence, Western blot and isometric tension recording techniques RESULTS: Patch clamp recordings from detrusor cells revealed a Ca2+ independent K+ current that was activated by depolarization in a voltage range near the resting potential of detrusor smooth muscle. The current was inhibited by 3,4-diaminopyridine, a blocker of KV channels. Antibodies targeted to KValpha1 subunits revealed KV1.3 and KV1.6 expression in whole bladder tissue samples and specifically in detrusor smooth muscle cells. New specific blockers of KValpha1 channel currents (correolide and recombinant agitoxin-2) had a myogenic effect, characterized by increased amplitude of spontaneous contractions without an effect on the frequency of contractions or on resting baseline tension.

In the present study, fifteen healthy males and females, 18 to 38 years old and representing varied activity patterns from sedentary to athletic, performed maximal dynamic knee extensions on an isokinetic loading dynamometer. Maximal torque forces attained at a specific point in the range (30 degrees before full extension) and at seven loading velocities from 0 (isometric) to 288 degrees/sec were recorded. The maximum 30 degrees torques exhibited by the various subjects ranged from 29 to 245 Newton-meters. However, over the four lower test velocities (0, 48, 96 & 144 degrees/sec), all subjects exhibited less than a 15% deviation from their respective maximum 30 degrees torque values, which occurred most often at the 96 degree/sec test velocity. Maximal instantaneous power output at the 30 degree position ranged from 98 to 680 Watts. In all 15 subjects this was attained at and remained generally constant over the three highest test velocities (192 to 288 degrees/sec). A neural mechanism that restricts a muscle's maximal tension in-vivo is postulated as being responsible for the marked difference between the force-velocity relationship found for human muscles in-vivo and that exhibited by isolated animal muscles.",1978,10,3,159-66,,#3101,Perrine 1978,
422,21819137.0,Single myosin cross-bridge orientation in cardiac papillary muscle detects lever-arm shear strain in transduction.,Biochemistry,"Myosin motors transduce ATP free energy into mechanical work. Transduction models allocate specific functions to motor structural domains beginning with ATP hydrolysis in the active site and ending in a lever-arm rotating power-stroke. Myosin light chains, regulatory (RLC) and essential (ELC), bind IQ-domains on the lever-arm and track its movement. Strong evidence exists that light chains stabilize the lever-arm and that light chain mutation undermines stability. Human ventricular RLC tagged with photoactivatable GFP (HCRLC-PAGFP) replaces native RLC in porcine papillary muscle fibers, restores native contractility, and situates PAGFP for single molecule orientation tracking within the crowded fiber lattice. The spatial emission pattern from single photoactivated PAGFP tagged myosins was observed in z-stacks fitted simultaneously to maximize accuracy in estimated dipole orientation. Emitter dipole polar and azimuthal angle pair scatter plots identified an area where steric and molecular crowding constraints depopulated orientations unfavorable for actin interaction. Transitions between pre- and post-power-stroke states represent the lever-arm trajectory sampled by the data and quantify lever-arm shear strain in transduction at three tension levels. These data identify forces acting on myosin in the in situ fiber system due to crowding, steric hindrance, and actomyosin interaction. They induce lever-arm shear strain observed with single molecule orientation detection. A single myosin work histogram reveals discretized power-stroke substates reminiscent of the Huxley-Simmons model for myosin based contraction [Huxley and Simmons ( 1971 ) Nature 233 , 533]. RLC or ELC mutation, should it impact lever-arm shear strain, will be detected as changes in single myosin shear strain or power-stroke substate distribution.",2011,50,36,7809-21,10.1021/bi2008992,#3102,Burghardt 2011,

Ten male subjects were asked to respond to the flashing light by performing a plantar flexion as strongly and quickly as possible. The myoelectric signals from agonist (m. gastrocnemius, caput laterale: LG, m. soleus: SOL) and antagonist (m. tibialis anterior: TA) were simultaneously recorded together with the isometric contraction force signal. The excitability of the alpha motoneuron pools by means of the H reflex analysis was also determined at various phases of the movement. The results obtained are as follows: 1) In five out of 10 subjects, the electromyographic silent period was consistently observed (SP Group), while the rest of the subjects did not show such changes (NSP Group). 2) The maximum rate of tension raise (dF/dt) in SP Group (32.3 +/- 24.9 N/ms) was significantly (p less than .05) greater than NSP Group (15.1 +/- 12.0 N/ms). 3) In SP Group, the averaged H-wave mean amplitude decreased about 40ms prior to the appearance of SP. From these results, it can be concluded that SP in this study was attributable to the supraspinal influences so as to allow a specific motor program to be executed for selective recruitment of phasic (high threshold) motor units.",1991,10,4,211-8,10.2114/ahs1983.10.211,#3103,Shibata 1991,

An algometric study.,Acta Paediatr,"The origin of recurrent abdominal pain of ""non-organic origin"" is believed to be psychogenic in most cases. But the pathogenesis of the pain itself is unknown. To test the hypothesis that recurrent abdominal pain of non-organic origin is related to increased pain sensitivity in the myofascial elements of the abdominal wall itself, an investigation of pain pressure threshold of the abdominal wall, close to the umbilicus, was carried out. Altogether 140 children in the fourth school grade, approximately 11 years old, were tested for pressure pain threshold. Two groups were constituted: one without pain symptoms (no recurrent abdominal pain, chest pains or headache (n = 50)) and one with recurrent abdominal pain (n = 49). The pressure pain threshold differed significantly (p < 0.0001). To support the hypothesis that recurrent abdominal pain is a part phenomenon of a specific pattern of muscular tension and tenderness, the pressure pain threshold was tested in five other muscles, with significant results.",1993,82,5,481-3,10.1111/j.1651-2227.1993.tb12727.x,#3104,AlfvÃ©n 1993,
425,22952043.0,Generalized anxiety disorder and the proposed associated symptoms criterion change for DSM-5 in a treatment-seeking sample of anxious youth.,Depress Anxiety,"BACKGROUND: A current proposal for the DSM-5 general anxiety disorder (GAD) definition is to remove fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and sleep disturbance from the list of associated symptoms, and to require the presence of one of two retained symptoms (restlessness or muscle tension) for diagnosis. Relevant evaluations in youth to support such a change are sparse. METHODS: The present study evaluated patterns and correlates of the DSM-IV GAD associated symptoms in a large outpatient sample of anxious youth (N = 650) to empirically consider how the proposed diagnostic change might impact the prevalence and sample composition of GAD in children. RESULTS: Logistic regression found irritability to be the most associated, and restlessness to be the least associated, with GAD diagnosis. Fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances-which have each been suggested to be nonspecific to GAD due to their prevalence in depression-showed sizable associations with GAD even after accounting for depression and attention problems. Among GAD youth, 10.9% would not meet the proposed DSM-5 associated symptoms criterion. These children were comparable to GAD youth who would meet the proposed criteria with regard to clinical severity, symptomatology, and functioning. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of youth with excessive, clinically impairing worry may be left unclassified by the DSM-5 if the proposed GAD associated symptoms criterion is adopted. Despite support for the proposed criterion change in adult samples, the present findings suggest that in children it may increase the false negative rate. This calls into question whether the proposed associated symptoms criterion is optimal for defining childhood GAD.",2012,29,12,994-1003,10.1002/da.21999,#3105,Comer 2012,
426,3769904.0,Contributions of slow and fast muscles of triceps surae to a cyclic movement.,Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol,"The relative contribution of synergistic muscles has been studied during pedalling on a bicycle. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the different components of triceps surae (namely soleus or SOL and medial gastrocnemius or MG) has been recorded and analyzed for increasing pedalling speed performed against increasing resistance. The results indicate that SOL IEMG (integrated EMG) increases linearly (y = 2x-12.1; r = 0.98) with increasing load (10-70 N) at constant speed (60 rpm), whereas no change is noted in MG IEMG below 40 N. In contrast, when the pedalling speed is increased (from 30 to 170 rpm) at constant load, MG IEMG shows the largest increase. Furthermore, although in both muscles EMG activity appears earlier in the movement with increases in load and/or speed, the delay between the onset of both EMGs remains unchanged at constant speed and synchronization of MG with SOL is only observed when speed is increased above 140 rpm. These results suggest that the different muscles of the triceps surae make specific contributions to the development of the mechanical tension required to maintain or increase the speed of movement.",1986,55,5,476-81,10.1007/BF00421640,#3106,Duchateau 1986,

The Z-band lattice is also expanded, except for soleus type I fibers with presumably stiffer Z bands.

Separate analyses for each diagnostic group revealed no relationship between age or fiber type distribution and response to halothane or caffeine. When all caffeine results were pooled, however, there was a significant effect of age on the caffeine specific concentration (the concentration eliciting a contracture of 1 g), but not on the caffeine threshold concentration (the minimal concentration eliciting an increase in tension).

Investigations in our laboratory have indicated that these agents inhibit fatty acid (FA) transport by tumors and several sub-types of white adipose tissue via inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor mechanisms. Skeletal muscle constitutes over 45% of human body mass and plays an important role in cancer cachexia and obesity-related diseases. Since fatty acid oxidation is a major source of energy for this tissue, we tested the hypothesis that physiologic MLT levels, EPA, or CLA injected intravenously, inhibit FA uptake in rat skeletal muscle in vivo. We used a surgical technique for catheterizing the femoral vein in rats that allows rapid blood collection from the entire hind limb, while ensuring continuous blood flow to the tissue. Blood acid/gas tensions and hematocrit were monitored and remained constant during the course of each experiment. The MLT, EPA, and CLA inhibited FA uptake by the tissue and lowered cAMP values. Glucose uptake and glycerol production in the hind limb were not affected.

432,2465662.0,"Tetrodotoxin-resistant contractions induced by electrical stimulation of bladder muscle from man, rabbit and rat.",Acta Physiol Scand,"Isolated detrusor preparations from man, rabbit and rat were suspended in an organ bath and isometric tension was recorded. The preparations were stimulated electrically in the presence of Bay K8644 and nifedipine before and after neuronal blockade with tetrodotoxin. Transmural electrical stimulation produced frequency-dependent contractions in all preparations. Bay K8644 significantly increased and nifedipine decreased these contractions. TTX effectively suppressed the response to electrical field stimulation in all species. When Bay K8644 was added to TTX blocked preparations, the responses to electrical stimulation were partly restored in bladder strips from man and rat. No increase in response was seen in the rabbit preparations. However, if the extracellular K+-concentration was increased to 10 mM (which per se did not affect the response) Bay K8644 significantly increased the contractions. All responses elicited by electrical stimulation in the presence of TTX were abolished by nifedipine. It is concluded that if the bladder smooth muscle is exposed to factors that can increase its sensitivity to contractile agents, this may result in uncontrolled (unstable) bladder contractions. Such contractions may use the 'normal' transmitter substances, but may be triggered at a lower stimulus intensity than normal. As a non-specific increase in membrane excitability seems to be associated with an influx of calcium through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, calcium antagonists, together with agents specifically blocking relevant transmitter substances, would offer an effective therapy against the unstable bladder.",1988,132,2,233-9,10.1111/j.1748-1716.1988.tb08322.x,#3112,Fovaeus 1988,
433,880399.0,Peripheral limiting factors during exercise in chronic lung diseases.,Bull Eur Physiopathol Respir,"In normal subjects the sensation of general fatigue subjectively limits the physical performance, whereas in patients with reduced respiratory function the sensation of breathlessness is the common limiting symptom. Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease may adopt an intermittent exercise pattern (e.g. when climibing stairs), in which the work periods are brief in duration but relatively high in intensity. The immediate ventilatory demand can in that way be reduced. The local metabolism of the working muscles can meet the increased demand, which demonstrates that peripheral factors are unlikely to limit the physical performance in these patients. For evaluating the importance of peripheral factors limiting the exercise tolerance of daily activities, such as stair-climbing or walking uphill, such activities should specifically be studied considerating also the exercise pattern shown by the patient. Even in bronchitic patients with reduced arterial oxygen tension there are no evidence that the skeletal muscles are working under more anaerobic conditions than in normal persons at the same relative work load. The blood lactate as related to the heart rate usually lies within normal limits. In patients with respiratory failure, however, lack of energy supply from the energy rich compounds may develop. Thus, only in extreme situations can the exercise performance of the respiratory patients be expected to be specifically limited by peripheral factors. Physical inactivity leads to changes in the muscle metabolism as in normal persons with reduced aerobic capacity in the muscles. The specific effects of steroid treatment on the muscle function in patients with chronic obstructive disease have not been studied, but may be an important factor limiting muscular performance at certain types of exercises.",1977,13,3,381-6,,#3113,Grimby 1977,

Isometric force, contractile properties, and fatigue were measured in electrically stimulated muscles (0.3 ms, 1-256 Hz), and Na+K+ and Ca2+ATPase activities were quantified in muscle membrane preparations. Systolic arterial pressure and aortic blood flow were recorded at rest and during LD muscle stimulation. Compared with control muscle, diabetic muscle showed smaller maximum specific tetanic tension and lower rates of rise and fall in force. Diabetic LD muscle also showed lower muscle enzyme activities. Twitch tension and fatigue did not differ between groups. Smaller increases in aortic flow and systolic pressure after CDM were found in diabetic rats compared to controls. The marked decrease in CDM effectiveness in diabetic rats likely reflected the alterations in muscle properties associated with diabetes.",2004,28,4,326-31,10.1111/j.1525-1594.2004.47349.x,#3114,DeAngelis 2004,

The present experiments were designed to test whether pioneering axons regenerating through a large muscle graft showed specificity for their homonymous distal stumps if faced with a choice of pathways. Regeneration was assessed with respect to nerve conduction, the electromyograph, isometric tension and morphological indices of nerve regeneration in the median and ulnar nerves of non-human primates. Reinnervation of both distal stumps with functional neuromuscular transmission was found to take place by growth of nerve fibres from either proximal nerve into either distal stump. There was thus no evidence of specific homonymous reinnervation.

After BR, attenuation in P were observed in lower limb movements (decreased by 19.8-43.6% for squatting, KF and KE), in upper limb movements on the other hand, the decreases in P were not significant (approximately -5% for EF and EE). Decrease in P in lower limb were more pronounced in heavier loaded conditions which were characterized by decreases in both F and V. For KF and KE, decreases in maximal static F (-18.9 to approximately -26.8%) were more pronounced than the decreases observed in the PCSA (approximately -7%), resulting in decreases in specific tension (-12.3 to approximately -22.1%).

To determine whether volatile anesthetics directly affect cardiac contractile proteins in humans, we examined the effects of various equianesthetic doses of halothane (0.46, 0.83, and 1.23 mM, equivalent to 0.75, 1.50, and 2.25%, respectively) and isoflurane (0.63, 1.22, and 1.93 mM, equivalent to 1.15, 2.30, and 3.50%, respectively) on the Ca2+ sensitivity and maximal force in human skinned cardiac fibers. METHODS: Left ventricular muscle strips were obtained from seven patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Sarcolemma was disrupted with EGTA (ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), and sarcoplasmic reticulum was destroyed with EGTA plus BRIJ 58 detergent. Ca2+ sensitivity was studied by observing the isometric tension developed by skinned fiber bundles challenged with solutions of increasing Ca2+ concentrations expressed in pCa (where pCa = -log10[Ca2+]). Maximal force was measured with a pCa 4.8 solution. RESULTS: Both anesthetics shifted the pCa-tension curves toward higher Ca2+ concentrations and decreased pCa for half-maximal activation in a dose-dependent and reversible fashion (from 5.71 for control to 5.56 and 5.55 for 1 MAC halothane and isoflurane, respectively) without changing the slope of this relationship (Hill coefficient). No differences between agents were observed at equianesthetic concentrations. The two agents also decreased the maximal activated tension in a dose-dependent fashion (-27 and -28% vs. control for 2 MAC halothane and isoflurane, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that halothane and isoflurane decrease Ca2+ sensitivity and maximal force in human skinned cardiac fibers at 20 degrees C. If these effects extend to higher temperatures, they may contribute to the negative inotropic effect of these agents.",1994,80,3,625-33,10.1097/00000542-199403000-00020,#3125,Tavernier 1994,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present the case of a 65 y.o. female patient who received a FNL. Miniature metal pins were placed on the external surface of the SMAS in order to ensure radiological monitoring. A cephalo­metric and photographic monitoring were performed pre­operatively and on day 1, months 2, 6 and 16 postoperatively . We performed a computed numerised analysis of the movement of the markers in an orthogonal axis. RESULTS: All our bearings kept a constant position in the radiographic follow-up , demons­tra­ting the fixity of SMAS kinked 16 months postoperatively. Clinically the correction remained a good appearance with a very slight relaxation of the superficial tissues (skin and subcutaneous fat). CONCLUSION: In the case of our patient, the tensioning of the deep facial plan (the SMAS) objectively appeared to be efficient over time, with an overall delay of 16 months.

However, other reports showed that endothelium-dependent relaxation was not observed in isometric tension studies using HUA ring with intact endothelium. Thus, we intended to clarify whether vascular smooth muscle of HUA at term is sensitive to EDRF. HUA was obtained after normal vaginal delivery or cesarean section at term. Isometric tension studies were performed in normal Krebs solution, using HUA rings or strips, which were prepared in calcium-free Krebs solution. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide (NO) donor drug, relaxed HUA rings precontracted with 0.1 microM 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) in a dose-dependent manner (1 nM-10 microM). Histamine, substance P, carbachol, or the calcium ionophore A23187, which are considered to be EDRF-releasing agents, did not relax the HUA rings. By immunohistochemical study, it was confirmed that endothelial cells were present in the luminal surface of the HUA rings after the isometric tension recording. In a co-axial bioassay system involving HUA strips denuded of endothelium and rabbit aorta with intact endothelium, HUA strips precontracted with 0.1 microM 5HT were relaxed in response to 1 microM SNP but not 1 microM carbachol, which released EDRF from the endothelium of rabbit aorta.

452,1809860.0,"A presumed reflex by which upward gaze induces relaxation of accommodation, a way to overcome instrument myopia.",Med Hypotheses,"This hypothesized reflex relates the vertical direction of gaze to the amount of tension exerted by the ciliary muscle. Based on simple observations the following is assumed. When looking downwards a tendency for closer focusing (near searching) exists even without a specific visual stimulus, whereas looking up favors a more relaxed state of the accommodative mechanism. This reflex is much weaker than accommodation induced by visual stimuli but may have potential practical implications with regards to automated objective ocular refraction devices. When using such instruments it is crucial to eliminate entirely all accommodation. The inability to achieve such relaxation has prevented automated devices from completely replacing all manual and subjective techniques in ophthalmology practice. If the reflex is empirically proven to exist, then by performing objective examinations while the patient's gaze is directed up, more precise measurements may be achieved. An additional benefit can be derived from comparing upward versus forward gaze measurements. Even a small difference can imply that accommodation has been triggered, so that ultimately this screening method enables identification of the accommodators sub-group and reciprocally approving the accuracy of the non-accommodators sub-group results.",1991,36,4,381-3,10.1016/0306-9877(91)90016-r,#3132,Blumenthal 1991,

The main techniques that we used were tension recording and electrophysiology. RESULTS: We previously reported distinct electrical activity and cell types in the prostate, and speculated on their functional roles. We believe that a specialized group of c-kit immunoreactive prostatic interstitial cells that lie between glandular epithelium and smooth muscle stroma have a role similar to that of gastrointestinal interstitial cells of Cajal, generating the pacemaker signal that manifests as slow wave activity and triggers contraction in smooth muscle cells in guinea pig prostates. CONCLUSIONS: Since changes in muscle tone are involved in the etiology of age dependent prostate specific conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, knowledge of the electrical properties of the various prostatic cell types and their interactions with each other, with nerves and with the hormonal environment, and how these factors change with age is of considerable medical importance.",2011,185,1,347-51,10.1016/j.juro.2010.09.036,#3136,Nguyen 2011,
457,33427927.0,Purinergic smooth muscle contractions in the human prostate: estimation of relevance and characterization of different agonists.,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,"Non-adrenergic prostate smooth muscle contractions may account for the limited effectiveness of α(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, which are the first-line option for medical treatment of voiding symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. In non-human prostates, purinergic agonists induce contractions reaching similar magnitudes as α(1)-adrenergic contractions. However, evidence for the human prostate is highly limited, and pointed to much weaker purinergic contractions. Here, we examined contractions of different purinergic agonists in human prostate tissues. Tissues were obtained from radical prostatectomy. Contractions were studied in an organ bath, and expression of purinergic receptors was studied by RT-PCR. Electric field stimulation (EFS)-induced contractions amounted to 104% of KCl-induced contractions (95% CI: 84-124%). From all tested agonists, only ATP induced concentration-dependent contractions, reaching an average maximum of 18% (12-24%) of KCl. Maximum tensions following application of other agonists averaged to 7.1% of KCl for α,β-methylene-ATP (1.8-12.4%), 3.9% for β,γ-methylene-ATP (2.0-5.4%), 3.1% for 2-methylthio-ATP (- 0.1-6.3%), and 5.1% for ATPγS (1.0-9.2%). Responses were not affected by the P2X antagonist NF023 or the P2Y antagonist PPADS. mRNA expression of P2X1-4 correlated with expression of a marker for catecholaminergic nerves, although neither ATP, NF023, nor PPADS changed EFS-induced contractions. Correlation between expression of receptors and the smooth muscle marker calponin was not observed. Our findings point to a low relevance of purinergic contractions in the human prostate, compared to other contractile stimuli in the human prostate and compared to purinergic contractions in non-human prostates. Purinergic contractions in the human prostate are not sensitive to NF023 or PPADS.",2021,394,6,1113-1131,10.1007/s00210-020-02044-4,#3137,Spek 2021,Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
458,15045518.0,Interactions between cGMP- and cAMP-pathways are involved in the regulation of penile smooth muscle tone.,World J Urol,"Nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic GMP (cGMP)-mediated mechanisms have a pivotal function in reducing the tone of the penile smooth musculature during normal erectile responses. The cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway is also involved in the adjustment of smooth muscle contractility, and suggestions for interactions between cGMP- and cAMP-mediated mechanisms have been presented. Using activators of the cGMP- or the cAMP-pathway, as well as inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA; cAMP-dependent kinase) and protein kinase G (PKG; cGMP-dependent kinase), the present study was undertaken to further delineate the functional relation between these pathways in the penis. In addition, the distribution of PKA and some cAMP-binding phosphodiesterases (cAMP-PDEs) were investigated in human erectile tissue. Functional experiments were performed on isolated human corpus cavernosum (HCC). The effects of an inhibitor of the PKA, Rp-8CPT-cAMPS (10 microM), or the PKG, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (10 microM), on relaxation induced by the cumulative administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), forskolin, sildenafil or tadalafil (IC351) were studied in preparations of HCC precontracted with 1 microM norepinephrine (NE). Using immunohistochemical procedures, the presence of immunoreactivity for cAMP-PDEs PDE3, PDE4, and PDE4A, as well as for PKA was investigated in specimens of HCC from which preparations were also used in the functional experiments. Forskolin, SNP, sildenafil, and IC 351 dose-dependently reversed NE-induced tension of isolated HCC preparations. The relaxing effects of SNP were significantly attenuated by Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, but not by Rp-8CPT-cAMPS. In contrast, relaxation induced by forskolin, sildenafil and tadalafil were significantly reversed by both Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS and Rp-8CPT-cAMPS. Abundant immunoreactivity for PDE3 and PKA was observed in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells. Immunoreactivity for PDE4 was also detected in the smooth musculature and in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining the cavernous sinusoids, as well as in nerve fibres interspersing the trabecular stroma. The present results support the hypothesis of interactions between cGMP- and cAMP-mediated signals in the HCC, and suggest that the effects of inhibitors of PDE5 on isolated erectile tissue may also partly or indirectly include actions of the cAMP second messenger system. The exact mechanism by which such an interaction occurs is not clear, but it may involve altered activity of the cGMP-inhibited PDE3 brought about by a change in the intracellular levels of cGMP by the inhibition of PDE5. This will in turn lead to increasing levels of cAMP, facilitating the interaction of cAMP with the PKA. The immunoreactivity specific for PDE3, PDE4, PDE4A and PKA registered in HCC section is also in support of an important role for the cAMP/PKA-system for penile smooth muscle function.",2004,22,4,261-6,10.1007/s00345-003-0394-4,#3138,Uckert 2004,
459,33368226.0,"Topography and evidence of a separate ""fascia plate"" for the femoral nerve inside the iliopsoas - A dorsal approach.",J Anat,"The femoral nerve stretch test is an essential part of clinical neurological examinations. This test is performed alongside Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to determine if there is any evidence of nerve root irritation, usually as a consequence of disc prolapse. The test occasionally gives false positive results. Why such false positives can occur, is subject to continued research, however, no obvious reason has yet emerged. We hypothesize that connectives of the femoral nerve may explain such a phenomenon. To see these connectives, we approached the femoral nerve from dorsal in 12 cases. With the use of ink injection into the subparaneural compartment of the femoral nerve and dissections, a thin transparent structure can clearly be seen that is separate from the epineurium, perineurium, and a paraneural sheath. A continuation of the paraneural sheath produces a fascia plate approximately 1.5 cm in width and with a thickness of around 3 mm, which not only circumnavigates the nerve but projects into the surrounding tissues. Our qualitative observations show that not only does this femoral nerve fascia plate exists, but it also contains nerves and vessels. Furthermore, we show that the femoral nerve is connected to the myofascial complex of the iliopsoas, and in a separate fascia plate from the iliopsoas fascia. This plate is a hitherto neglected connective which extends as far as the spinal dura mater. Evidence from our plastinates and histological sections suggests that when tension is applied to the femoral nerve during the femoral nerve stretch test, tension is also applied to the femoral nerve fascia plate. The femoral nerve fascia plate could be a specific factor that contributes to pain resulting in a false positive femoral nerve stretch test.",2021,238,5,1233-1243,10.1111/joa.13374,#3139,Kulow 2021,Methylene blue
460,10850961.0,Series of exon-skipping events in the elastic spring region of titin as the structural basis for myofibrillar elastic diversity.,Circ Res,"Titins are megadalton-sized filamentous polypeptides of vertebrate striated muscle. The I-band region of titin underlies the myofibrillar passive tension response to stretch. Here, we show how titins with highly diverse I-band structures and elastic properties are expressed from a single gene. The differentially expressed tandem-Ig, PEVK, and N2B spring elements of titin are coded by 158 exons, which are contained within a 106-kb genomic segment and are all subject to tissue-specific skipping events. In ventricular heart muscle, exons 101 kb apart are joined, leading to the exclusion of 155 exons and the expression of a 2.97-MDa cardiac titin N2B isoform. The atria of mammalian hearts also express larger titins by the exclusion of 90 to 100 exons (cardiac N2BA titin with 3.3 MDa). In the soleus and psoas skeletal muscles, different exon-skipping pathways produce titin transcripts that code for 3.7- and 3.35-MDa titin isoforms, respectively. Mechanical and structural studies indicate that the exon-skipping pathways modulate the fractional extensions of the tandem Ig and PEVK segments, thereby influencing myofibrillar elasticity. Within the mammalian heart, expression of different levels of N2B and N2BA titins likely contributes to the elastic diversity of atrial and ventricular myofibrils.",2000,86,11,1114-21,10.1161/01.res.86.11.1114,#3140,Freiburg 2000,

However, the status of the receptor-effector systems that mediate these actions of ET-1 in asthmatic airways is currently unknown. Thus, we have used quantitative autoradiographic and isometric-tension recording techniques to evaluate the density, distribution, and function of the specific receptors that mediate the actions of ET-1 in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic airways. Here, we report that similar numbers of specific binding sites for [125I]-ET-1 exist in asthmatic and nonasthmatic airways, with the greatest densities located in airway smooth muscle in both tissue types. The ETB-receptor subtype constituted approximately 82% and 88% of these receptors for ET-1 in asthmatic and nonasthmatic human bronchial smooth muscle, respectively, and mediated contraction in response to this peptide. In addition, a component of ET-1-induced contraction appeared to be mediated by a non-ETB, BQ-123-resistant mechanism. Furthermore, a small population of ETA sites was identified that did not mediate contraction, but which may have a role in ET-1-induced prostanoid release and airway smooth-muscle proliferation. Interestingly, bronchial smooth muscle from asthmatic lung was significantly less sensitive to the contractile effects of ETB receptor activation, consistent with desensitization of this receptor subtype in response to the increased production and release of ET-1 that occurs in this disease.",1995,152,5 Pt 1,1653-8,10.1164/ajrccm.152.5.7582310,#3141,Goldie 1995,

The study design included prospective cohort of patients with neck pain referred to physical therapy. Development of a CPR will assist clinicians in classifying patients with neck pain likely to benefit from cervical traction. Eighty patients with neck pain received a standardized examination and then completed six sessions of intermittent cervical traction and cervical strengthening exercises twice weekly for 3 weeks. Patient outcome was classified at the end of treatment, based on perceived recovery according to the global rating of change. Patients who achieved a change > or =+6 (""A great deal better"" or ""A very great deal better"") were classified as having a successful outcome. Univariate analyses (t tests and chi-square) were conducted on historical and physical examination items to determine potential predictors of successful outcome. Variables with a significance level of P < or = 0.15 were retained as potential prediction variables. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) were then calculated for all variables with a significant relationship with the reference criterion of successful outcome. Potential predictor variables were entered into a step-wise logistic regression model to determine the most accurate set of clinical examination items for prediction of treatment success. Sixty-eight patients (38 female) were included in data analysis of which 30 had a successful outcome. A CPR with five variables was identified: (1) patient reported peripheralization with lower cervical spine (C4-7) mobility testing; (2) positive shoulder abduction test; (3) age > or =55; (4) positive upper limb tension test A; and (5) positive neck distraction test. Having at least three out of five predictors present resulted in a +LR equal to 4.81 (95% CI = 2.17-11.4), increasing the likelihood of success with cervical traction from 44 to 79.2%. If at least four out of five variables were present, the +LR was equal to 23.1 (2.5-227.9), increasing the post-test probability of having improvement with cervical traction to 94.8%. This preliminary CPR provides the ability to a priori identify patients with neck pain likely to experience a dramatic response with cervical traction and exercise. Before the rule can be implemented in routine clinical practice, future studies are necessary to validate the rule. The CPR developed in this study may improve clinical decision-making by assisting clinicians in identifying patients with neck pain likely to benefit from cervical traction and exercise.",2009,18,3,382-91,10.1007/s00586-008-0859-7,#3143,Raney 2009,
464,12478033.0,Fractures of the olecranon: an in vitro study of elbow joint stresses after tension-band wire fixation versus proximal fracture fragment excision.,J Trauma,"BACKGROUND: Displaced fractures of the olecranon usually require operative treatment, by either open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) or excision of the proximal fragment. However, the relative merits of these treatment options have not been fully delineated. One treatment outcome measure of joint function is residual intra-articular stress. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of these two types of olecranon fracture treatment on humeroulnar joint stress. METHODS: Eight matched pairs of fresh frozen cadaveric upper extremities were thawed; stripped of skin, muscular, and neurovascular tissue; and potted in polymethylmethacrylate. The intra-articular humeroulnar joint peak pressures were measured at 90 degrees of elbow flexion using pressure-sensitive film after application of a 0.15 kg-m torque through the remaining triceps muscle attachment. First, pretreatment (normal) pressures were obtained from the major contact regions of the humeroulnar joint. A 50% olecranon osteotomy was then performed simulating a fracture, and the elbows from each of the paired specimens were randomly assigned to one or the other of two treatment groups: ORIF (using a tension-band wiring technique) and proximal fragment excision. Joint pressures were remeasured. A two-tailed paired t test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: After osteotomy, the peak pressures were higher, overall, in the excision group. Comparing each posttreatment experimental group to its pretreatment (normal) counterpart revealed that the peak pressures in the distal medial and distal lateral articular subzones were significantly higher for the fragment excision group (p = 0.005 and p= 0.0008, respectively), but were not significantly different in the ORIF group (p = 0.545 and p= 0.153, respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that ORIF restores the normal biomechanics of the elbow joint and proximal fragment excision results in abnormally elevated joint stresses. These elevated joint stresses may, over time, contribute to the development of elbow pain and osteoarthrosis. Therefore, ORIF should continue to be regarded as the treatment of choice for displaced fractures of the olecranon involving large proximal fracture fragments similar in size to those in this study.",2002,53,6,1088-93,10.1097/00005373-200212000-00010,#3144,Moed 2002,

The scientific basis for eccentric quasi-isometric resistance training: A narrative review. J Strength Cond Res 33(10): 2846-2859, 2019-Eccentric quasi-isometric (EQI) resistance training involves holding a submaximal, yielding isometric contraction until fatigue causes muscle lengthening and then maximally resisting through a range of motion. Practitioners contend that EQI contractions are a powerful tool for the development of several physical qualities important to health and sports performance. In addition, several sports involve regular quasi-isometric contractions for optimal performance. Therefore, the primary objective of this review was to synthesize and critically analyze relevant biological, physiological, and biomechanical research and develop a rationale for the value of EQI training. In addition, this review offers potential practical applications and highlights future areas of research. Although there is a paucity of research investigating EQIs, the literature on responses to traditional contraction types is vast. Based on the relevant literature, EQIs may provide a practical means of increasing total volume, metabolite build-up, and hormonal signaling factors while safely enduring large quantities of mechanical tension with low levels of peak torque. Conversely, EQI contractions likely hold little neuromuscular specificity to high velocity or power movements. Therefore, EQI training seems to be effective for improving musculotendinous morphological and performance variables with low injury risk. Although speculative due to the limited specific literature, available evidence suggests a case for future experimentation.",2019,33,10,2846-2859,10.1519/JSC.0000000000003291,#3145,Oranchuk 2019,
466,10409227.0,alpha-Thrombin stimulates contraction of human bronchial rings by activation of protease-activated receptors.,Am J Physiol,"In a variety of diseases, inflammation causes microvascular leakage and activates thrombin. Evidence suggests that thrombin increases cytosolic calcium and stimulates human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell proliferation. The receptor subtypes, however, that mediate the effects of thrombin on ASM cell growth or calcium mobilization remain unknown. In this study, we postulate that thrombin, which activates specific protease-activated receptors (PARs), also stimulates contraction of isolated human bronchial rings. With the use of intact human bronchial rings, alpha-thrombin (1-20 U/ml) increased bronchial tone to 19 +/- 3% of basal tone (P = 0.008; n = 5 experiments) and represents 20 +/- 8% of the maximum carbachol response. The EC(50) for thrombin-induced force generation was 12.2 U/ml (95% confidence interval 9.9-15.3 U/ml) and was not altered in bronchial rings that had the epithelium removed. In parallel experiments, a specific thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP-14; 0.1-100 micromol/l) increased isometric tension to levels (14 +/- 2%; P = 0.0005; n = 5 experiments) comparable to those rings stimulated with thrombin. To characterize the receptors that mediate thrombin effects on human ASM, the expression of PARs in cultured human ASM cells was analyzed by RT-PCR analysis with specific primers for PARs. In these cells, PAR1 (thrombin receptor), PAR2, and PAR3 were expressed at comparable levels. In other experiments using immunocytochemical staining with specific antibodies to PAR1 and PAR2, we showed that ASM in bronchial rings and cultured ASM cells express PAR1 and PAR2 proteins. Taken together, these studies suggest that alpha-thrombin, in a receptor-specific and dose-dependent manner, induces contraction of bronchial rings in vitro. In addition, cultured human ASM cells express mRNA of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3 and express PAR1 and PAR2 protein. Further studies are needed to determine whether alpha-thrombin plays a role in stimulating bronchoconstriction in inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma and bronchiolitis obliterans.",1999,277,1,L22-9,10.1152/ajplung.1999.277.1.L22,#3146,Hauck 1999,
467,29443077.0,Contractility Measurements of Human Uterine Smooth Muscle to Aid Drug Development.,J Vis Exp,"Discovery and characterization of novel pharmaceutical compounds or biochemical probes rely on robust and physiologically relevant assay systems. We describe methods to measure ex vivo myometrium contractility. This assay can be used to investigate factors and molecules involved in the modulation of myometrial contraction and to determine their excitatory or inhibitory actions, and hence their therapeutic potential in vivo. Biopsies are obtained from women undergoing cesarean section delivery with informed consent. Fine strips of myometrium are dissected, clipped and attached to a force transducer within 1 mL organ baths superfused with physiological saline solution at 37 °C. Strips develop spontaneous contractions within 2-3 h under set tension and remain stable for many hours (>6 h). Strips can also be stimulated to contract such as by the endogenous hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin, which cause concentration-dependent modulation of contraction frequency, force and duration, to more closely resemble contractions in labor. Hence, the effect of known and novel drug leads can be tested on spontaneous and agonist-induced contractions. This protocol specifically details how this assay can be used to determine the potency of known and novel agents by measuring their effects on various parameters of human myometrial contraction. We use the oxytocin- and V1a receptor antagonists, atosiban and SR49059 as examples of known compounds which inhibit oxytocin- and vasopressin-induced contractions, and demonstrate how this method can be used to complement and validate pharmacological data obtained from cell-based assays to aid drug development. The effects of novel agonists in comparison to oxytocin and vasopressin can also be characterized. Whilst we use the example of the oxytocin/ vasopressin system, this method can also be used to study other receptors and ion channels that play a role in uterine contraction and relaxation to advance the understanding of human uterine physiology and pathophysiology.",2018,,131,,10.3791/56639,#3147,Arrowsmith 2018,
468,16257253.0,A comparative FEA of the debonding process in different concepts of cemented hip implants.,Med Eng Phys,"Debonding of the stem-cement interface and damage accumulation in the cement mantle are basic events that contribute to the long-term failure of cemented hip reconstructions. In this work, a numerical study with these two processes coupled is presented. On the one hand, debonding of the stem-cement interface was simulated by means of a cohesive surface theory that was implemented into an interface finite element. This interface model includes a tensile-shear behavior law, the fatigue failure of the interface, and the friction evolution between both surfaces. On the other hand, damage accumulation in the cement was formulated through the theory of continuum damage mechanics, considering cement damage due to tension, creep under compression, crack closure effects, non-linear damage accumulation and cement residual stresses appearing during polymerisation. This methodology was applied to simulate and compare the degradation process of the cement and stem-cement interface in four different concepts of design: Exeter, Charnley, Elite Plus and ABG II stems. As the actual mechanical properties of the surface of each specific prosthesis are not known, we assumed the same for all of them, distinguishing between polished and matt surfaces. With this assumption, the predicted results showed that the debonding process is very different for each implant depending on the stem geometry. Lower cement deterioration was obtained for the Exeter and ABG II stems, while the lowest stem-cement interface debonding was produced in the Exeter and the Elite Plus stems.",2006,28,6,525-33,10.1016/j.medengphy.2005.09.007,#3148,PÃ©rez 2006,
469,27023351.0,Smooth muscle filamin A is a major determinant of conduit artery structure and function at the adult stage.,Pflugers Arch,"Human mutations in the X-linked FLNA gene are associated with a remarkably diverse phenotype, including severe arterial morphological anomalies. However, the role for filamin A (FlnA) in vascular cells remains partially understood. We used a smooth muscle (sm)-specific conditional mouse model to delete FlnA at the adult stage, thus avoiding the developmental effects of the knock-out. Inactivation of smFlnA in adult mice significantly lowered blood pressure, together with a decrease in pulse pressure. However, both the aorta and carotid arteries showed a major outward hypertrophic remodeling, resistant to losartan, and normally occurring in hypertensive conditions. Notably, arterial compliance was significantly enhanced in the absence of smFlnA. Moreover, reactivity of thoracic aorta rings to a variety of vasoconstrictors was elevated, while basal contractility in response to KCl depolarization was reduced. Enhanced reactivity to the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist U46619 was fully reversed by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632. We discuss the possibility that a reduction in arterial stiffness upon smFlnA inactivation might cause a compensatory increase in conduit artery diameter for normalization of parietal tension, independently of the ROCK pathway. In conclusion, deletion of smFlnA in adult mice recapitulates the vascular phenotype of human bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopia, culminating in aortic dilatation.",2016,468,7,1151-1160,10.1007/s00424-016-1813-x,#3149,Retailleau 2016,Aorta

However, understanding of this contraction type is rudimentary. We aimed to compare the acute effects of a single session of isotonic EQIs with isokinetic eccentric (ECC) contractions. METHODS: Fifteen well-trained men performed a session of impulse-equated EQI and ECC knee extensions, with each limb randomly allocated to one contraction type. Immediately PRE, POST, 24/48/72 h, and 7 days post-exercise, regional soreness, quadriceps swelling, architecture, and echo intensity were evaluated. Peak concentric and isometric torque, rate of torque development (RTD), and angle-specific impulse were evaluated at each time point. RESULTS: There were substantial differences in the number of contractions (ECC: 100.8 ± 54; EQI: 3.85 ± 1.1) and peak torque (mean: ECC: 215 ± 54 Nm; EQI: 179 ± 28.5 Nm). Both conditions elicited similar responses in 21/53 evaluated variables. EQIs resulted in greater vastus intermedius swelling (7.1-8.8%, ES = 0.20-0.29), whereas ECC resulted in greater soreness at the distal and middle vastus lateralis and distal rectus femoris (16.5-30.4%, ES = 0.32-0.54) and larger echogenicity increases at the distal rectus femoris and lateral vastus intermedius (11.9-15.1%, ES = 0.26--0.54). Furthermore, ECC led to larger reductions in concentric (8.3-19.7%, ES = 0.45-0.62) and isometric (6.3-32.3%, ES = 0.18-0.70) torque and RTD at medium-long muscle lengths.

Bovine and canine trachea relax to amiloride in vitro, suggesting another benefit as a bronchodilator, whereas guinea pig trachea, a useful model of human airways, does not. We hypothesized that human airways would respond like guinea pig airways. Airway ring segments from guinea pigs, mice, and human fetuses were constricted with the concentration of acetylcholine producing 50-75% maximum contraction. Subsequent changes in isometric tension to cumulative additions of amiloride (10(-8)-10(-4) M) were measured. Guinea pig airways contracted 29 +/- 5%, mouse airways contracted 23 +/- 6%, and human fetal airways contracted 30 +/- 8%. Contraction to amiloride was mimicked by dimethylamiloride, a more selective inhibitor of the Na+/H+ antiporter, and was attenuated by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition with GF109203X and staurosporine.

472,23887900.0,Age-related slowing of myosin actin cross-bridge kinetics is sex specific and predicts decrements in whole skeletal muscle performance in humans.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"We hypothesize that age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction and physical disability may be partially explained by alterations in the function of the myosin molecule. To test this hypothesis, skeletal muscle function at the whole muscle, single fiber, and molecular levels was measured in young (21-35 yr) and older (65-75 yr) male and female volunteers with similar physical activity levels. After adjusting for muscle size, older adults had similar knee extensor isometric torque values compared with young, but had lower isokinetic power, most notably in women. At the single-fiber and molecular levels, aging was associated with increased isometric tension, slowed myosin actin cross-bridge kinetics (longer myosin attachment times and reduced rates of myosin force production), greater myofilament lattice stiffness, and reduced phosphorylation of the fast myosin regulatory light chain; however, the age effect was driven primarily by women (i.e., age-by-sex interaction effects). In myosin heavy chain IIA fibers, single-fiber isometric tension and molecular level mechanical and kinetic indexes were correlated with whole muscle isokinetic power output. Collectively, considering that contractile dysfunction scales up through various anatomical levels, our results suggest a potential sex-specific molecular mechanism, reduced cross-bridge kinetics, contributes to the reduced physical capacity with aging in women. Thus these results support our hypothesis that age-related alterations in the myosin molecule contribute to skeletal muscle dysfunction and physical disability and indicate that this effect is stronger in women.",2013,115,7,1004-14,10.1152/japplphysiol.00563.2013,#3152,Miller 2013,aging
473,10854624.0,Hypercapnia-induced contraction in isolated pulmonary arteries is endothelium-dependent.,Respir Physiol,"It has been demonstrated previously that isohydric hypercapnia (IH) does not affect agonist-induced tension development in pulmonary arteries. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of IH on depolarisation-induced, steady state tension in the isolated rat pulmonary artery. Rings were submaximally contracted with high KCl under control conditions (5% CO(2)-95% air). IH was achieved by switching to a modified PSS (isosmotic substitution of NaHCO(3) for NaCl), equilibrated with 10% CO(2) in air. On switching to IH, a significant increase in mean (+/-SEM) tension (25.3+/-6.3% Tmax) was observed in endothelium intact rings (n=6). Endothelial removal significantly reduced this response. Non-specific inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoenzymes (L-NAME, 10(-3) M) abolished the IH-induced increase in tension while inhibition of neuronal NOS (TRIM, 10(-5) M) was without effect. The relaxant response to the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside was similar in IH and control conditions. These results suggest that IH caused an endothelium-dependent increase in depolarisation-induced tension by reducing NO production.",2000,121,1,65-74,10.1016/s0034-5687(00)00106-7,#3153,Lynch 2000,

The ratio of hyaluronic acid to chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate in all three cuff tendons was approximately 1. Rotator cuff tendons contained large proteoglycan similar to aggrecan, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel migration elution from Sepharose CL-4B, and content of both chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate chains.

In contrast decorin was the only proteoglycan prominent in distal/tensional regions of biceps tendon. Histological analysis showed layers of loosely organized alcian blue-stained material running between the longitudinal collagen fiber bundles. The proteoglycan content of rotator cuff tendons was similar to fibrocartilage in tendons that have been subjected to compressive loads in situ. This suggests that cells of normal adult rotator cuff tendons have adapted to loads distinct from pure tension. However, the histological organization did not resemble mature fibrocartilage. The increased amount of proteoglycan in rotator cuff tendons may serve to separate and lubricate collagen bundles as they move relative to each other during normal shoulder motion.",1996,14,4,518-25,10.1002/jor.1100140404,#3154,Berenson 1996,

METHOD: The KSP was administered to 102 obese patients prior to entering an 8-week weight loss program. Patients were weighed again at the end of treatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: The KSP did not predict initial weight loss after the 8-week program. Several of the KSP scales (Muscle Tension, Monotony Avoidance, Suspicion, and Guilt) had weak associations with 12-month relapse status. Weight gain at the 3-month follow-up was the strongest predictor of 12-month relapse status (O.R. = 0.46; 95% C.I. = 0.32, 0.66). DISCUSSION: Personality traits, as measured by the KSP, do not appear to be important predictors of initial weight loss or 12-month relapse status. Personality assessment may not substantially contribute to predicting treatment outcome in obesity research.",1999,25,3,301-9,10.1002/(sici)1098-108x(199904)25:3<301::aid-eat8>3.0.co;2-p,#3155,PostonWS2nd 1999,
476,19767810.0,Modeling age-related neuromuscular changes in humans.,Appl Physiol Nutr Metab,"With aging, motoneurons and muscle tissue undergo significant changes, which influence function in terms of strength, mobility, and overall independence. Mathematical modeling provides a practical method of studying the relationships among recruitment, rate-coding, and force output in motor units, and may be used to predict functional neuromuscular changes related to aging. For this study, the Heckman-Binder model was used to examine changes in human quadriceps motor units. Relationships among current input, firing frequency, and force output were defined for both a younger and an older individual. Included in the model were age-related effects associated with reduced muscle contractile speed; reduced muscle-fibre number, size, and specific tension; reduced gain of the frequency-current relationship; decreased size of motoneurons; and altered motor unit remodeling. Adjustment of this model to reflect age-related changes resulted in a leftward shift of the force-frequency function, lower firing frequency for any given current injected into the motoneuron, and a reduction in maximal force output. The model suggests that older individuals are capable of reaching force levels up to approximately 50% of those attained by younger individuals, with relatively similar or even slightly lower levels of current input. This could mean that the sense of effort and the contribution of factors other than degree of effort from afferent inputs to the pool, including conscious supraspinal centres, might be different in the older adult.",2009,34,4,732-44,10.1139/H09-052,#3156,Webber 2009,
477,21240029.0,Psychophysiological effects of preperformance massage before isokinetic exercise.,J Strength Cond Res,"Sports massage provided before an activity is called pre-event massage. The hypothesized effects of pre-event massage include injury prevention, increased performance, and the promotion of a mental state conducive to performance. However, evidence with regard to the effects of pre-event massage is limited and equivocal. The exact manner in which massage produces its hypothesized effects also remains a topic of debate and investigation. This randomized single-blind placebo-controlled crossover design compared the immediate effects of pre-event massage to a sham intervention of detuned ultrasound. Outcome measures included isokinetic peak torque assessments of knee extension and flexion; salivary flow rate, cortisol concentration, and α-amylase activity; mechanical detection thresholds (MDTs) using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments and mood state using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. This study showed that massage before activity negatively affected subsequent muscle performance in the sense of decreased isokinetic peak torque at higher speed (p < 0.05). Although the study yielded no significant changes in salivary cortisol concentration and α-amylase activity, it found a significant increase in salivary flow rate (p = 0.03). With the massage intervention, there was a significant increase in the MDT at both locations tested (p < 0.01). This study also noted a significant decrease in the tension subscale of the POMS for massage as compared to placebo (p = 0.01). Pre-event massage was found to negatively affect muscle performance possibly because of increased parasympathetic nervous system activity and decreased afferent input with resultant decreased motor-unit activation. However, psychological effects may indicate a role for pre-event massage in some sports, specifically in sportspeople prone to excessive pre-event tension.",2011,25,2,481-8,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181e83a47,#3157,Arroyo-Morales 2011,

These cells gradually displace from distal to proximal position alongside the bronchial tree, elongate, and begin to synthesize SM-specific proteins. Mechanical tension (either generated by cell spreading/elongation or stretch), as well as epithelial paracrine factors, regulates the process of bronchial myogenesis. The specific roles of many of these paracrine factors during normal lung development are currently unknown. It is also unknown how and if mechanical and paracrine signals integrate into a common myogenic pathway. Furthermore, as with vascular SM and other types of visceral SM, we are just beginning to elucidate the intracellular signaling pathways and the genetic program that controls lung myogenesis.

A finite-element analysis study.,Rom J Morphol Embryol,"Commonly is accepted that a non-vital tooth has a higher risk of root fracture but there is a relatively little knowledge about the specific biomechanical behavior of non-vital frontal teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the deformation and tensile generated in these teeth while vertically loading them because it is crucial to assess the moment when the absorbed occlusal forces exceed the elasticity of root dentine. Using the method of finite-element analysis, we highlighted the distribution patterns of the compressive and tension tensile, as well as their concentration areas. The vertical forces of 100 N generate deformations of no clinical risk in teeth with chronic apical periodontitis. The tensile developed in these teeth are higher than those in the vital teeth are but do not exceed the value of the elastic modulus of the radicular dentin. By increasing the force to 300 N occur elastic deformations, which cannot be neglected anymore. Even so, the 300 N forces do not generate deformations of the alveolar bone. The highest tensile at loading with 300 N was generated in vertical direction but in the cervical area of the tooth also developed tensile in lingual and mesiodistal direction that must be taken into consideration because they are near the risk limit of the elasticity modulus. The crack lines or fractures can appear both in case of excessive or even usual but accumulative occlusal forces that gradually alter the mechanical resistance of the tooth.",2013,54,3,587-92,,#3159,Petcu 2013,

Specifically, we characterized the mechanical profiles of papillary muscle fibers from transgenic mice expressing human ventricular RLC wild-type (Tg-WT) or E22K mutation (Tg-E22K). Because the two mouse models expressed different amounts of transgene, the B6SJL mouse line (NTg) was used as an additional control. Mechanical experiments were carried out on Ca(2+) - and ATP-activated fibers and in rigor. Sinusoidal analysis was performed to elucidate the effect of E22K on tension and stiffness during activation/rigor, tension-pCa, and myosin cross-bridge (CB) kinetics. We found significant reductions in active tension (by 54%) and stiffness (active by 40% and rigor by 54%). A decrease in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension (by ∆pCa ~ 0.1) was observed in Tg-E22K compared with Tg-WT fibers. The apparent (=measured) rate constant of exponential process B (2πb: force generation step) was not affected by E22K, but the apparent rate constant of exponential process C (2πc: CB detachment step) was faster in Tg-E22K compared with Tg-WT fibers. Both 2πb and 2πc were smaller in NTg than in Tg-WT fibers, suggesting a kinetic difference between the human and mouse RLC. Our results of E22K-induced reduction in myofilament stiffness and tension suggest that the main effect of this mutation was to disturb the interaction of RLC with the myosin heavy chain and impose structural abnormalities in the lever arm of myosin CB. When placed in vivo, the E22K mutation is expected to result in reduced contractility and decreased cardiac output whereby leading to HCM. SUB-DISCIPLINE: Bioenergetics.

481,10938997.0,The origin of intermittent exhalation (A! Ha! Ha!) peculiar to human laugh.,Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol,"Since Darwin (1872), the origin of the laugh with an intermittent exhalation ""A! Ha! Ha!"" which is peculiar to human, has been a great question. The author found out that this laugh is caused by the three sets of emotion. Firstly, light surprise or discovery. The ability to estimate ""light"" is absolutely important, because the amount of the first exhalation ""A!"" caused by the stimulation is decided by the amount of ""surprise"" felt by the subject. The ability to estimate the amount of ""surprise"" to be ""light"", makes the partial exhalation ""A!"". Secondly, consciousness of this harmlessness or delight, and thirdly, the following expectation of some safe circumstances. The author proved this theory by electromyography (EMG), photoplethysmography and galvanic skin reaction (GSR). The similarity between the facial EMG distribution pattern of ""the beginning of laugh"" and ""the light surprise"" was proved by electromyography about many facial muscles, with special fine electrode which did not disturb any natural facial expression of the subjects. Plethysmography and GSR proved light sympathetic tension and following relaxation when laughing.

482,9251240.0,Kinase-related protein: a smooth muscle myosin-binding protein.,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,"Kinase-related protein (telokin) is a small myosin-binding protein which has recently been discovered in smooth muscle. The KRP messenger RNA is transcribed from within the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) gene, a rare example in vertebrates of two proteins coded for by a single gene. Owing to a separate transcription unit and a common reading frame, kinase-related protein is expressed as an independent protein which consists of the C-terminal 156 amino acids of the kinase. It binds specifically to dephosphorylated smooth muscle myosin and inhibits myosin phosphorylation by MLCK in vitro, suggesting that it might modify the rate of myosin activation and consequently the rate of tension development in the muscle. KRP also stabilizes an extended conformation of dephosphorylated myosin which can polymerize, and thereby stabilizes myosin in the filamentous state against the dissociating effect of ATP. Thus, kinase-related protein may have a function in regulating the assembly of myosin filaments into the contractile apparatus in the cell.",1997,29,5,727-30,10.1016/s1357-2725(96)00156-2,#3163,Vorotnikov 1997,
483,21041317.0,Increased catalase expression improves muscle function in mdx mice.,Exp Physiol,"It has been well established that oxidative stress contributes to pathology associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). I hypothesized that overexpression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase would improve muscle function in the mdx mouse, the mouse model of DMD. To test this hypothesis, neonatal mdx mice were injected with a recombinant adeno-associated virus driving the catalase transgene. Animals were killed 4 or 6 weeks or 6 months following injection. Muscle function was generally improved by catalase overexpression. Four weeks following injection, extensor digitorum longus specific tension was improved twofold, while soleus was similar between groups. Resistance to contraction-induced injury was similar between groups; however, resistance to fatigue was increased 25% in catalase-treated soleus compared with control muscle. Six weeks following injection, extensor digitorum longus specific tension was increased 15%, while soleus specific tension was similar between treated and untreated limbs. Catalase overexpression reduced contraction-induced injury by 30-45% and fatigue by 20% compared with control limbs. Six months following injection, diaphragm specific tension was similar between groups, but resistance to contraction-induced injury was improved by 35% and fatigue by 25%. Taken together, these data indicate that catalase can improve a subset of parameters of muscle function in dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle.",2011,96,2,194-202,10.1113/expphysiol.2010.054379,#3164,Selsby 2011,

This is especially relevant in patients with an observable limitation of duction movement. The purpose of this study was to validate passive duction forces in healthy subjects using a novel instrument. METHODS: An instrument for making continuous quantitative measurements of passive duction forces was designed. Tension was measured as the eyeball was rotated horizontally or vertically from the resting position under general anesthesia 10 mm (50°) away from the direction of force to be tested (opposite side). RESULTS: Seventy eyes of 35 subjects were enrolled in this study (age range of 4-80 years and mean age of 36.3 years). The passive duction force was measured at 49.0 ± 15.3 g (mean ± standard deviation) for medial rotation, 44.8 ± 13.2 g for lateral rotation, 50.5 ± 14.8 g for superior rotation, and 53.5 ± 13.8 g for inferior rotation. The passive duction forces were similar for all gaze positions, but it was larger for inferior rotation than for lateral rotation (P = 0.009). The passive duction force was significantly larger for vertical rotation (51.9 ± 14.4 g) than for horizontal rotation (46.9 ± 14.4 g) (P = 0.006). The passive duction force did not differ significantly with sex (P = 0.355), side (P = 0.087), or age (P = 0.872). CONCLUSIONS: These measurements of passive duction forces in a healthy population provide valuable information for diagnosing specific strabismic problems and could be useful for increasing the precision of strabismus surgery.

485,35853157.0,Use of a Novel Multimodal Imaging Technique to Model In Vivo Quadriceps Force and ACL Strain During Dynamic Activity.,Am J Sports Med,"BACKGROUND: Quadriceps loading of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) may play a role in the noncontact mechanism of ACL injury. Musculoskeletal modeling techniques are used to estimate the intrinsic force of the quadriceps acting at the knee joint. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this paper was to develop a novel musculoskeletal model of in vivo quadriceps force during dynamic activity. We used the model to estimate quadriceps force in relation to ACL strain during a single-leg jump. We hypothesized that quadriceps loading of the ACL would reach a local maximum before initial ground contact with the knee positioned in extension. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS: Six male participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging in addition to high-speed biplanar radiography during a single-leg jump. Three-dimensional models of the knee joint, including the femur, tibia, patellofemoral cartilage surfaces, and attachment-site footprints of the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, and ACL, were created from the magnetic resonance imaging scans. The bone models were registered to the biplanar radiographs, thereby reproducing the positions of the knee joint at the time of radiographic imaging. The magnitude of quadriceps force was determined for each knee position based on a 3-dimensional balance of the forces and moments of the patellar tendon and the patellofemoral cartilage contact acting on the patella. Knee kinematics and ACL strain were determined for each knee position. RESULTS: A local maximum in average quadriceps force of approximately 6500 N (8.4× body weight) occurred before initial ground contact. ACL strain increased concurrently with quadriceps force when the knee was positioned in extension. CONCLUSION: This novel participant-specific modeling technique provides estimates of in vivo quadriceps force during physiologic dynamic loading. A local maximum in quadriceps force before initial ground contact may tension the ACL when the knee is positioned in extension. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data contribute to understanding noncontact ACL injury mechanisms and the potential role of quadriceps activation in these injuries.",2022,50,10,2688-2697,10.1177/03635465221107085,#3166,Englander 2022,MRI

Studies describing the evolutionary line of these connections are well known. The flexibility of particular leaflets of the tricuspid valve varies, as does the tension of the blood stream in particular cusps. The present study was performed on a group of 96 formalin-fixed adult human hearts, which ranged in age from 18 to 90 years and gave no evidence of congenital malformations or pathological changes. The valves were divided into five types according to earlier studies and analysis was made in terms of these types. The tendinous chords and their ramifications were counted. The surfaces of particular leaflets were measured. The ratio of marginal to ventricular leaflets was counted for each type of leaflet in particular types of valves. The parts of the main leaflets supported by specific papillary muscles were counted for types 1, 2 and 3. The number of tendinous chords decreased in leaflets in particular types of tricuspid valve, but the ratio of chords attached to the margins and ventricular surfaces was similar. The number of chords for the surface of leaflets (measured in mm2) was similar in particular types of valve for all cusps. The most differentiated were commissural chords in all types of valve. The ratio of chords attached to the margins and ventricular surfaces does not depend on the surface area of the leaflets.",2007,66,4,314-22,,#3167,Skwarek 2007,

Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate the effects of a novel, four-week, gymnastic-specific, eccentric-isokinetic (0.1 m/s) cluster training on a computer-controlled training device on the improvement of two static strength elements on rings (swallow and support scale). Nine elite male gymnasts participated in this study. Outcome parameters were maximum strength and strength endurance in maintaining the static position of both elements. After four weeks of training, specific maximum strength increased significantly (swallow: +4.1%; d = 0.85; p = 0.01; support scale: +3.6%; d = 2.47; p = 0.0002) and strength endurance tended to improve (swallow: +104.8%; d = 0.60; p = 0.07; support scale: +26.8%; d = 0.27; p = 0.19). Our results demonstrate that top athletes can considerably improve ring-specific strength and strength endurance in only four weeks. We assumed that the high specificity but also the unfamiliar stimulus of slow eccentric movements with very long times under maximal muscle tension led to these improvements.

488,16845551.0,New fundamental resistance exercise determinants of molecular and cellular muscle adaptations.,Eur J Appl Physiol,"Abstract Physical activity relies on muscular force. In adult skeletal muscle, force results from the contraction of postmitotic, multinucleated myofibres of different contractile and metabolic properties. Myofibres can adapt to (patho-)physiological conditions of altered functional demand by radial growth, longitudinal growth, and regulation of fibre type functional gene modules. The adaptation's specificity depends on the distinct molecular and cellular events triggered by unique combinations of conditional cues. In order to derive effective and tailored exercise prescriptions, it must be determined (1) which mechano-biological condition leads to what molecular/cellular response, and (2) how this molecular/cellular response relates to the structural, contractile, and metabolic adaptation. It follows that a thorough mechano-biological description of the loading condition is imperative. Unfortunately, the definition of (resistance) exercise conditions in the past and present literature is insufficient. It is classically limited to load magnitude, number of repetitions and sets, rest in-between sets, number of interventions/week, and training period. In this review, we show why the current description is insufficient, and identify new determinants of quantitative and/or qualitative effects on skeletal muscle with respect to resistance exercise in healthy, adult humans. These new mandatory determinants comprise the fractional and temporal distribution of the contraction modes per repetition, duration of one repetition, rest in-between repetitions, time under tension, muscular failure, range of motion, recovery time, and anatomical definition. We strongly recommend to standardise the design and description of all future resistance exercise investigations by using the herein proposed set of 13 mechano-biological determinants (classical and new ones).",2006,97,6,643-63,10.1007/s00421-006-0238-1,#3169,Toigo 2006,
489,3518128.0,In vitro and in vivo effect of verapamil on human airway responsiveness to leukotriene D4.,Thorax,"The mechanism by which leukotriene D4 (LTD4) induces airway narrowing in man is unclear. We have investigated this by examining the effect of the calcium channel blocker verapamil on the sensitivity of in vitro preparations of human bronchi to LTD4 and methacholine, and on the bronchoconstriction induced in normal subjects by these agonists in vivo. In vitro smooth muscle sensitivity was assessed by the concentration of LTD4 and methacholine causing a 50% of maximum contraction (EC50) and as the maximum tension generated. Verapamil did not alter baseline tension or the response to LTD4 but did inhibit contractile responses to methacholine. In vivo studies were performed in six normal subjects; they inhaled increasing concentrations of LTD4 (0.4-50 micrograms/ml) or methacholine (2-64 mg/ml). Airway responsiveness in vivo was expressed as the provocation concentration (PC) of agonist producing a 35% fall in specific airways conductance (PC35sGaw) and a 30% fall in flow at 30% of vital capacity (PC30 V30(p)). Verapamil did not alter baseline sGaw or V30(p). One subject did not respond to LTD4 on either day. In contrast to the in vitro results, verapamil produced a greater than 10 fold reduction in LTD4 induced bronchoconstriction, but had no effect on methacholine induced bronchoconstriction. These results suggest that in normal subjects bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled LTD4 is due to a combination of direct and indirect mechanisms.",1986,41,1,6-Dec,10.1136/thx.41.1.12,#3170,Roberts 1986,
490,8829881.0,Length-specific impairment of skeletal muscle contractile function after eccentric muscle actions in man.,Clin Sci (Lond),"1. The effects of maximum voluntary eccentric muscle actions on forearm flexor strength were studied at three different elbow joint angles (0.87, 1.57 and 2.79 rad) to examine whether subsequent impairment of contractile function is muscle length-specific. 2. A bout of 70 maximum voluntary eccentric muscle actions performed with the forearm flexors elicited delayed muscle soreness, efflux of creatine kinase into the blood, loss of elbow joint range of motion and a prolonged decline in maximum voluntary isometric contraction torque at the three elbow angles monitored (P < 0.01) in 30 subjects. 3. The relative decline in maximum voluntary isometric contraction torque after eccentric exercise differed between elbow angles (P < 0.01). The greatest decline in strength relative to baseline was observed at the most acute elbow angle of 0.87 rad, followed by 1.57 and 2.79 rad respectively. Superimposed electrical stimulation in a subgroup of eight subjects did not increase the torque elicited by the forearm flexors during maximum voluntary contraction tests at the most acute elbow angle (0.87 rad) at any time-point after eccentric exercise, suggesting the disproportionate loss of strength at short muscle length was not due to the inhibitory effects of muscle soreness. 4. Measures of arm circumference and ability to fully flex the elbow (in the same subgroup of eight subjects) suggested the greater decline in strength at the acute elbow angle was not due to the possible confounding influences of muscle swelling and/or impaired muscle shortening ability on strength measurements at short muscle length. 5. These data suggest a shift in the forearm flexor length-tension relationship could account for the disparate decline in strength between elbow angles after eccentric exercise. The disproportionate loss of strength at short muscle length suggests that eccentric exercise evoked a subtle increase in muscle length, perhaps attributable to the cumulative effects of regions of lengthened sarcomeres and/or series elastic elements.",1996,90,2,119-25,10.1042/cs0900119,#3171,Saxton 1996,

CRI resulted in significant smaller average cross sectional areas (CSAs) by ∼11% for UREM muscle fibers (vs CON, P < 0.01). At standard conditions, UREM fibers produced lower absolute and specific forces (i.e. normalized force per fiber CSA) (vs CON, P < 0.01); force increased in 30 °C for both groups (P < 0.01), but the disparity between UREM and CON remained significant.

Participants ingested 20 g of whey protein immediately after exercise and again at 24 h recovery. Needle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were obtained while fasted at rest and after 6, 24 and 30 h post-exercise in the fed-state following a primed, constant infusion of l-[ring-(13)C(6)]phenylalanine. Myofibrillar protein synthetic rate was higher in the SLOW condition versus CTL after 24-30 h recovery (P < 0.001) and correlated to p70S6K phosphorylation (r = 0.42, P = 0.02). Exercise-induced rates of mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis were elevated by 114% and 77%, respectively, above rest at 0-6 h post-exercise only in the SLOW condition (both P < 0.05). Mitochondrial protein synthesis rates were elevated above rest during 24-30 h recovery in the SLOW (175%) and CTL (126%) conditions (both P < 0.05). Lastly, muscle PGC-1α expression was increased at 6 h post-exercise compared to rest with no difference between conditions (main effect for time, P < 0.001). These data show that greater muscle time under tension increased the acute amplitude of mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis and also resulted in a robust, but delayed stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis 24-30 h after resistance exercise.",2012,590,2,351-62,10.1113/jphysiol.2011.221200,#3174,Burd 2012,
494,9129940.0,The mode of action of several opioids on cardiac muscle.,Exp Physiol,"The objective of the experiments was to investigate the cellular basis of the inotropic effect on myocardium of several opioids which have been implicated in producing cardiotoxic effects in human poisoning. Opioids exerted negative inotropic effects, with half-maximal concentrations between 10 microM (dextropropoxyphene) and 118 microM (pethidine); all agents reduced the magnitude of the intracellular Ca2+ transient and the L-type Ca2+ current, ICa, over a similar concentration range to that which reduced twitch tension. The depression of ICa correlated positively with the value of the opioid oil-water partition coefficient. Effects were not antagonized by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Action potential upstroke rate was also reduced but at significantly higher concentrations. Resting potential and action potential duration were not consistently affected; none of the opioids tested altered intracellular pH. These data suggest that opioids exert a negative inotropic effect by their action on ICa; blockade of the Na+ current is not great enough to exert a significant action. The lack of effect of naloxone implies the actions are independent of the opioid receptor. The correlation of effects with the oil water partition coefficient implies a non-specific effect dependent on the hydrophobicity of the agent.",1997,82,2,261-72,10.1113/expphysiol.1997.sp004021,#3175,Wu 1997,
495,35088396.0,Aerobic Adaptations to Resistance Training: The Role of Time under Tension.,Int J Sports Med,"Generally, skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise are perceived through a dichotomous lens where the metabolic stress imposed by aerobic training leads to increased mitochondrial adaptations while the mechanical tension from resistance training leads to myofibrillar adaptations. However, there is emerging evidence for cross over between modalities where aerobic training stimulates traditional adaptations to resistance training (e.g., hypertrophy) and resistance training stimulates traditional adaptations to aerobic training (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis). The latter is the focus of the current review in which we propose high-volume resistance training (i.e., high time under tension) leads to aerobic adaptations such as angiogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and increased oxidative capacity. As time under tension increases, skeletal muscle energy turnover, metabolic stress, and ischemia also increase, which act as signals to activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, which is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. For practical application, the acute stress and chronic adaptations to three specific forms of high-time under tension are also discussed: Slow-tempo, low-intensity resistance training, and drop-set resistance training. These modalities of high-time under tension lead to hallmark adaptations to resistance training such as muscle endurance, hypertrophy, and strength, but little is known about their effect on traditional aerobic training adaptations.",2022,43,10,829-839,10.1055/a-1664-8701,#3176,Mang 2022,
496,2005569.0,Antagonism of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) by human CGRP-(8-37): role of CGRP in internal anal sphincter relaxation.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,We performed functional studies on the opossum internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle strips and receptor binding studies in the IAS smooth muscle membranes to examine the influence of: human calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-(8-37) on the fall in IAS tension caused by human CGRP I and CGRP II and on [125I]human CGRP I binding on the IAS smooth muscle membranes. We also compared the ability of [Tyr0]-rat CGRP 28-37 to displace the radioligand from the IAS membranes to that of human CGRP-(8-37). Human CGRP-(8-37) caused significant and dose-dependent right-ward shifts of the dose-response curves of both CGRP I and CGRP II on the IAS smooth muscle. The specific binding of [125I]human CGRP I to IAS smooth muscle membranes was time- and temperature-dependent. CGRP antagonists human CGRP-(8-37) and [Tyr0]-rat CGRP 28-37 and CGRP I and CGRP II caused dose-dependent displacement of the radioligand. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calcitonin on the other hand had no significant effect on the radioligand binding. Tachyphylaxis and cross tachyphylaxis to the effects of CGRP I and CGRP II were observed. The CGRP antagonists and CGRP I and CGRP II tachyphylaxis failed to modify the fall in the IAS tension in response to neural stimulation by electrical field stimulation. From these studies we conclude: human CGRP-(8-37) and [Tyr0]-rat CGRP 28-37 may serve as potential antagonists of CGRP action; human CGRP I and CGRP II may act on the same receptor on the IAS smooth muscle; and CGRP may not play a significant role in the IAS relaxation in response to electrical field stimulation.,1991,256,3,1019-24,,#3177,Chakder 1991,
497,28572500.0,Neuromuscular electrical stimulation improves skeletal muscle regeneration through satellite cell fusion with myofibers in healthy elderly subjects.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"The aim of this study was to determine whether neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) affects skeletal muscle regeneration through a reduction of oxidative status in satellite cells of healthy elderly subjects. Satellite cells from the vastus lateralis skeletal muscle of 12 healthy elderly subjects before and after 8 wk of NMES were allowed to proliferate to provide myogenic populations of adult stem cells [myogenic precursor cells (MPCs)]. These MPCs were then investigated in terms of their proliferation, their basal cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentrations, and their expression of myogenic regulatory factors (PAX3, PAX7, MYF5, MYOD, and MYOG) and micro-RNAs (miR-1, miR-133a/b, and miR-206). The oxidative status of these MPCs was evaluated through superoxide anion production and superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. On dissected single skeletal myofibers, the nuclei were counted to determine the myonuclear density, the fiber phenotype, cross-sectional area, and tension developed. The MPCs obtained after NMES showed increased proliferation rates along with increased cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentrations and gene expression of MYOD and MYOG on MPCs. Muscle-specific miR-1, miR-133a/b, and miR-206 were upregulated. This NMES significantly reduced superoxide anion production, along with a trend to reduction of superoxide dismutase activity. The NMES-dependent stimulation of muscle regeneration enhanced satellite cell fusion with mature skeletal fibers. NMES improved the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle in elderly subjects. Accordingly, the skeletal muscle strength and mobility of NMES-stimulated elderly subjects significantly improved. NMES may thus be further considered for clinical or ageing populations.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) effect on skeletal muscle regeneration was assessed in healthy elderly subjects for the first time. NMES improved the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle through increased myogenic precursor cell proliferation and fusion with mature myofibers. The increased cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration along with MYOD, MYOG, and micro-RNA upregulation could be related to reduced O(2)(·-) production, which, in turn, favors myogenic regeneration. Accordingly, the skeletal muscle strength of NMES-stimulated lower limbs of healthy elderly subjects improved along with their mobility.",2017,123,3,501-512,10.1152/japplphysiol.00855.2016,#3178,DiFilippo 2017,micro-RNA
498,1785880.0,Role of sarcolemmal membrane sodium-calcium exchange in vascular smooth muscle tension.,Ann N Y Acad Sci,"A body of information obtained by experiments with intact tissues, isolated cells, and sarcolemmal vesicles indicates, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a specific Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange system exists in vascular smooth muscle. However, its role in the regulation of cytosolic free-Ca2+ concentration and cell tension under physiological conditions remains unclear. Under pharmacological conditions in which the Na(+)-K+ pump is inhibited either by digitalis glycosides or K(+)-free medium, Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange may be modulated by increases in cytosolic free Na+ to increase the cytosolic free-Ca2+ concentration and cell tension. Under pathological conditions in which the cytosolic Na+ concentration is increased as a result of inhibition of the Na(+)-K+ pump by endogenous ouabain or a digitalis-like factor, or activation of the Na(+)-H+ exchange or passive permeability of Na+, the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity of vascular smooth muscle and the nerve terminal may play an important role in the development and/or maintenance of hypertension. These and other premises remain to be confirmed or discounted.",1991,639,,531-42,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1991.tb17346.x,#3180,Matlib 1991,
499,12218746.0,"Exercise, diet, and skeletal muscle gene expression.",Med Sci Sports Exerc,"Skeletal muscle, as a consequence of its mass and great capacity for altered metabolism, has a major impact on whole-body metabolic homeostasis and is capable of remarkable adaptation in response to various physiological stimuli, including exercise and dietary intervention. Exercise-induced increases in skeletal muscle mRNA levels of a number of genes have been reported, due to transcriptional activation and/or increased mRNA stability. The cellular adaptations to exercise training appear to be due to the cumulative effects of transient increases in gene transcription after repeated exercise bouts. The relative importance of transcriptional (mRNA synthesis) and translational (mRNA stability or translational efficiency) mechanisms for the training-induced increases in skeletal muscle protein abundance remains to be fully elucidated. Dietary manipulation, and the associated alterations in nutrient availability and hormone levels, can also modify skeletal muscle gene expression, although fewer studies have been reported. A major challenge is to understand how exercise and diet exert their effects on gene and protein expression in skeletal muscle. In relation to exercise, potential stimuli include stretch and muscle tension, the pattern of motor nerve activity and the resultant calcium transients, the energy charge of the cell and substrate availability, oxygen tension and circulating hormones. These are detected by various cellular signaling mechanisms, acting on a range of downstream targets and a wide range of putative transcription factors. A key goal in the years ahead is to identify how alterations at the level of gene expression are coupled to the changes in skeletal muscle phenotype. It is clear that gene expression, although representing a specific site of regulation, is only one step in a complex cascade from the initial stimulus to the final phenotypic adaptation and integrated physiological response.",2002,34,9,1505-8,10.1097/00005768-200209000-00017,#3181,Hargreaves 2002,
500,32738735.0,Oxygen tension influences embryonic stem cell maintenance and has lineage specific effects on neural and cardiac differentiation.,Differentiation,"The importance of oxygen tension in in vitro cultures and its effect on embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation has been widely acknowledged. Research has mainly focussed on ESC maintenance or on one line of differentiation and only few studies have examined the potential relation between oxygen tension during ESC maintenance and differentiation. In this study we investigated the influence of atmospheric (20%) versus physiologic (5%) oxygen tension in ESC cultures and their differentiation within the cardiac and neural embryonic stem cell tests (ESTc, ESTn). Oxygen tension was set at 5% or 20% and cells were kept in these conditions from starting up cell culture until use for differentiation. Under these oxygen tensions, ESC culture showed no differences in proliferation and gene and protein expression levels. Differentiation was either performed in the same or in the alternative oxygen tension compared to ESC culture creating four different experimental conditions. Cardiac differentiation in 5% instead of 20% oxygen resulted in reduced development of spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes and lower expression of cardiac markers Nkx2.5, Myh6 and MF20 (myosin), regardless whether ESC had been cultured in 5% or 20% oxygen tension. As compared to the control (20% oxygen during stem cell maintenance and differentiation), neural differentiation in 5% oxygen with ESC cultured in 20% oxygen led to more cardiac and neural crest cell differentiation. The opposite experimental condition of neural differentiation in 20% oxygen with ESC cultured in 5% oxygen resulted in more glial differentiation. ESC that were maintained and differentiated in 5% oxygen showed an increase in neural crest and oligodendrocytes as compared to 20% oxygen during stem cell maintenance and differentiation. This study showed major effects on ESC differentiation in ESTc and ESTn of oxygen tension, which is an important variable to consider when designing and developing a stem cell-based in vitro system.",2020,115,,10-Jan,10.1016/j.diff.2020.07.001,#3182,Mennen 2020,Cardiac differentiation
501,16581309.0,Major classes of sensory neurons to the urinary bladder.,Auton Neurosci,"A novel in vitro bladder preparation was used to examine effect of various stimuli (stretch, von Frey hair compression, stroking of receptive fields, applications of chemical stimuli to the mucosa) on electrophysiological recordings from guinea pig bladder afferents in vitro. Several functionally distinct classes of bladder sensory neurons were distinguished. These include stretch-sensitive afferents-muscle mechanoreceptors which behaved as ""in-series tension receptors"" and tension-mucosal mechanoreceptors, which could be activated by stretch, mucosal stroking with light von Frey hair (0.1-2 mN) and by hypertonic solutions (1 M mannitol and 490-850 mM NaCl) applied locally to their receptive fields in the mucosa. In addition, we have recorded stretch-insensitive afferents-mucosal mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors. The non-selective P2X/P2Y purinoreceptor antagonist, PPADS (30 microM) did not affect stretch-induced firing by low threshold muscle mechanoreceptors but significantly inhibited alpha,beta-methylene ATP (30 microM)-induced contractions and associated afferent firing. Transduction by low threshold stretch-sensitive muscle mechanoreceptors does not appear to involve exocytotic synaptic transmission since it occurs in Ca2+-free (with 1 mM EDTA and 6 mM Mg2+) Krebs solution. The data suggest that the endogenous transmitter ATP is not involved in mechanotransduction by this specific class of low threshold muscle mechanoreceptors in the guinea pig bladder; rather they appear to transduce mechanical stimuli directly, possibly via stretch-activated ion channels. Mechanisms of activation of other classes of mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors remain to be established.",2006,126-127,,390-7,10.1016/j.autneu.2006.02.007,#3183,Zagorodnyuk 2006,

Translational studies require animal models that match human characteristics, such as Octodon degus, a diurnal rodent. This study aims to characterize the contractility of the detrusor muscle and the morphology and code of the vesical plexus from O. degus. Body temperature was measured by an intra-abdominal sensor, the contractility of detrusor strips was evaluated by isometric tension recording, and the vesical plexus was studied by electrical field stimulation (EFS) and immunofluorescence. The animals showed a diurnal chronotype as judged from core temperature. The myogenic contractile response of the detrusor muscle to increasing doses of KCl reached its maximum (31.04 mN/mm(2)) at 60 mM. In the case of cumulative dose-response of bethanecol, the maximum response (37.42 mN/mm(2)) was reached at 3.2 × 10(-4) M. The response to ATP was clearly smaller (3.8 mN/mm(2)). The pharmacological dissection of the EFS-induced contraction identified ACh and sensory fibers as the main contributors to this response. The neurons of the vesical plexus were located mainly in the trigone area, grouped in big and small ganglia. Out of them, 48.1 % of the neurons were nitrergic and 62.7 % cholinergic.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured tissue resistances offered to five types of meshes by four classical surgical routes. We also tested the incidence of the modification of the width of meshes on tissue resistance. This study was realized on frozen cadavers, by pull on prostheses just after implantation. Tests are realized with a dynamometer and results obtained in Newton. RESULTS: In the Retzius space, TVT offers a better resistance than IVS or LIFT meshes. We did not bring to the fore a significant difference between four routes for 1 cm wide prosthesis. The increase of width of Prolene meshes improves their resistance in tissues and thus quality of their fixation. We underscore a better resistance of the trans sacrospinous route with regard to the trans muscular one. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The increase of resistance is bound to the increase of the contact area between the prosthesis and the tissues. This increase of resistance should be taken into account in prolapse surgery: constraints are stronger than for stress incontinence. The posterior arms of meshes have to measure more than 1 cm wide and be set up through the sacrospinous ligament rather than through the elevator muscles. The type of knitting of prostheses is important and influences the resistance in tissues in the immediate postoperative time. Manufacturers should be interested in conceiving specific meshes for the tension-free fixation, with special and adapted mechanical properties.",2007,35,1,13-8,10.1016/j.gyobfe.2006.09.029,#3185,Boukerrou 2007,
504,23764881.0,Differential changes in titin domain phosphorylation increase myofilament stiffness in failing human hearts.,Cardiovasc Res,"AIMS: Titin-based myofilament stiffness is defined by the expression levels of the cardiac titin-isoforms, N2B and N2BA, and by phosphorylation of the elastic titin domains N2-B unique sequence (N2-Bus) and PEVK. Phosphorylation of the N2-Bus by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) or cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) decreases titin stiffness, whereas phosphorylation of the PEVK-domain by PKC increases it. We aimed to identify specific sites within the N2-Bus phosphorylated by PKA and PKG and to determine whether differential changes in titin domain phosphorylation could affect passive stiffness in human failing hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using mass spectrometry, we identified seven partly conserved PKA/PKG-targeted phosphorylation motifs in human and rat N2-Bus. Polyclonal antibodies to pSer4185, pSer4010, and pSer4099 in the N2-Bus, and to pSer11878 in the PEVK-region were used to quantify titin-domain phosphorylation by western blot analyses of a set of human donor and failing hearts with similar titin-isoform composition. Passive tension determined in skinned human myocardial fibre preparations was significantly increased in failing compared with donor hearts, notably at shorter sarcomere lengths where titin contributes most to total passive tension. Phosphorylation of Ser4185, Ser4010, and Ser4099 in the N2-Bus was significantly reduced in failing hearts, whereas phosphorylation of Ser11878 in the PEVK-region was increased compared with donor hearts. CONCLUSION: We conclude that hypo-phosphorylation of the N2-Bus and hyper-phosphorylation of the PEVK domain can act complementary to elevate passive tension in failing human hearts. Differential changes in titin-domain phosphorylation may be important to fine-tune passive myocardial stiffness and diastolic function of the heart.",2013,99,4,648-56,10.1093/cvr/cvt144,#3186,KÃ¶tter 2013,Connectin
505,16686439.0,AMP-activated protein kinase couples mitochondrial inhibition by hypoxia to cell-specific Ca2+ signalling mechanisms in oxygen-sensing cells.,Novartis Found Symp,"It is generally accepted that relatively mild hypoxia inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in O2-sensing cells, and thereby mediates, in part, cell activation. However, the mechanism by which this process is coupled to discrete, cell-specific Ca2+ signalling mechanisms remains elusive. We considered the possibility that hypoxia may increase the cellular ATP/AMP ratio, increase the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and thereby evoke Ca2+ signals in O2-sensing cells. Co-immunoprecipitation identified alpha1beta2gamma1 as the primary AMPK isozyme in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle, whilst the tissue-specific distribution of AMPK activities and their activation by hypoxia suggested that the AMPK-alpha1 catalytic subunit isoform is key to the regulation of O2-sensing cells. Strikingly, 3D reconstruction of immunofluorescence images showed AMPK-alpha1 to be located throughout the cytoplasm of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and, by contrast, targeted to the plasma membrane in carotid body glomus cells. Consistent with these observations Ca2+ imaging, tension recording and electrophysiology demonstrated that AMPK, like hypoxia, activates each cell type via discrete Ca2+ signalling mechanisms: cyclic ADP-ribose-dependent Ca2+ mobilization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and voltage-gated Ca2+ influx into carotid body glomus cells. Thus, metabolic-sensing by AMPK underpins the cell-specific response of O2-sensing cells to hypoxia.",2006,272,,"234-52; discussion 252-8, 274-9",,#3187,Evans 2006,

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of NT on human, dog, guinea pig, and rabbit GB in vitro, in order to delineate direct versus indirect actions of NT in different species and to evaluate the structure-activity relationships of NT. The effect of NT on the canine sphincter of Oddi (SOD) was also examined in vitro. Isolated longitudinal strips of GB from the four species given above and SOD from dogs were suspended in oxygenated Krebs buffer, and the isometric tension responses to various doses of NT, NT 8-13, NT 1-11, and xenopsin (XP) were determined. All the NT homologs, except NT 1-11, stimulated contraction of the dog GB and SOD in a dose-dependent manner. NT also caused dose-related stimulation of GB contraction from guinea pigs but did not stimulate or depress the contractile activity of human and rabbit GB strips. These results suggest that NT action on GB contraction is species-specific. Tetrodotoxin did not modify the contraction of dog GB and SOD in response to NT, indicating that NT mediates its contractile effects directly. The relaxing effect of NT on GB of humans in vivo, as previously reported by us, thus appears to be an indirect action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989,34,1,21-6,10.1007/BF01536149,#3188,Guo 1989,

In this study, the functional implications of cTnI proteolysis were investigated in human cardiac tissue for the first time. The predominant human cTnI degradation product (cTnI(1-192)) and full-length cTnI were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, reconstituted with the other cardiac troponin subunits, troponin T and C, and subsequently exchanged into human cardiac myofibrils and permeabilized cardiomyocytes isolated from healthy donor hearts. Maximal isometric force and kinetic parameters were measured in myofibrils, using rapid solution switching, whereas force development was measured in single cardiomyocytes at various calcium concentrations, at sarcomere lengths of 1.9 and 2.2 mum, and after treatment with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) to mimic beta-adrenergic stimulation. One-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western immunoblotting, and 3D imaging revealed that approximately 50% of endogenous cTnI had been homogeneously replaced by cTnI(1-192) in both myofibrils and cardiomyocytes. Maximal tension was not affected, whereas the rates of force activation and redevelopment as well as relaxation kinetics were slowed down. Ca(2+) sensitivity of the contractile apparatus was increased in preparations containing cTnI(1-192) (pCa(50): 5.73+/-0.03 versus 5.52+/-0.03 for cTnI(1-192) and full-length cTnI, respectively). The sarcomere length dependency of force development and the desensitizing effect of PKA were preserved in cTnI(1-192)-exchanged cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that degradation of cTnI in human myocardium may impair diastolic function, whereas systolic function is largely preserved.",2006,99,9,1012-20,10.1161/01.RES.0000248753.30340.af,#3189,Narolska 2006,

We report an original double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction technique using a quadriceps tendon graft and a simplified outside-in femoral tunnel-drilling process. The graft consists of a patellar bone block with its attached tendon split into superior and inferior portions, which yields 2 bundles.

The posterolateral tunnel is made through the same incision with a specific guide engaged in the anteromedial tunnel. A single tibial tunnel is created. The graft is routed from the tibia to the femur with the bone block in the tibial tunnel and the 2 bundles in their respective femoral tunnels.

509,25694375.0,Utility of craniosacral therapy in treatment of patients with non-specific low back pain. Preliminary report.,Ortop Traumatol Rehabil,"BACKGROUND: Non-specific low back pain is an increasingly common musculoskeletal ailment. The aim of this study was to examine the utility of craniosacral therapy techniques in the treatment of patients with lumbosacral spine overload and to compare its effectiveness to that of trigger point therapy, which is a recognised therapeutic approach. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 55 randomly selected patients (aged 24-47 years) with low back pain due to overload. Other causes of this condition in the patients were ruled out. The participants were again randomly assigned to two groups: patients treated with craniosacral therapy (G-CST) and patients treated with trigger point therapy (G-TPT). Multiple aspects of the effectiveness of both therapies were evaluated with the use of: an analogue scale for pain (VAS) and a modified Laitinen questionnaire, the Schober test and surface electromyography of the multifidus muscle. The statistical analysis of the outcomes was based on the basic statistics, the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon's signed rank test. The statistical significance level was set at p≤0.05. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated a significant reduction of pain measured with the VAS scale and the Laitinen questionnaire. Moreover, the resting bioelectric activity of the multifidus muscle decreased significantly in the G-CST group. The groups did not differ significantly with regard to the study parameters. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Craniosacral therapy and trigger point therapy may effectively reduce the intensity and frequency of pain in patients with non-specific low back pain. 2. Craniosacral therapy, unlike trigger point therapy, reduces the resting tension of the multifidus muscle in patients with non-specific lumbosacral pain. The mechanism of these changes requires further research. 3. Craniosacral therapy and trigger point therapy may be clinically effective in the treatment of patients with non-specific lumbosacral spine pain. 4. The present findings represent a basis for conducting further and prospective studies of larger and randomized samples.",2014,16,6,605-15,10.5604/15093492.1135120,#3191,BiaÅoszewski 2014,

511,26666743.0,Intramuscular Anabolic Signaling and Endocrine Response Following Resistance Exercise: Implications for Muscle Hypertrophy.,Sports Med,"Maintaining skeletal muscle mass and function is critical for disease prevention, mobility and quality of life, and whole-body metabolism. Resistance exercise is known to be a major regulator for promoting muscle protein synthesis and muscle mass accretion. Manipulation of exercise intensity, volume, and rest elicit specific muscular adaptations that can maximize the magnitude of muscle growth. The stimulus of muscle contraction that occurs during differing intensities of resistance exercise results in varying biochemical responses regulating the rate of protein synthesis, known as mechanotransduction. At the cellular level, skeletal muscle adaptation appears to be the result of the cumulative effects of transient changes in gene expression following acute bouts of exercise. Thus, maximizing the resistance exercise-induced anabolic response produces the greatest potential for hypertrophic adaptation with training. The mechanisms involved in converting mechanical signals into the molecular events that control muscle growth are not completely understood; however, skeletal muscle protein synthesis appears to be regulated by the multi-protein phosphorylation cascade, mTORC1 (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). The purpose of this review is to examine the physiological response to resistance exercise, with particular emphasis on the endocrine response and intramuscular anabolic signaling through mTORC1. It appears that resistance exercise protocols that maximize muscle fiber recruitment, time-under-tension, and metabolic stress will contribute to maximizing intramuscular anabolic signaling; however, the resistance exercise parameters for maximizing the anabolic response remain unclear.",2016,46,5,671-85,10.1007/s40279-015-0450-4,#3193,Gonzalez 2016,
512,31191087.0,The Effects of Eccentric Cadence on Power and Velocity of the Bar during the Concentric Phase of the Bench Press Movement.,J Sports Sci Med,"Training at a specific movement tempo is a relatively new concept in resistance training. It is based on manipulation of the duration of particular phases of a movement. General studies have demonstrated that faster movement tempo in resistance training leads to an increase in muscle power, whereas lower movement speed is beneficial in the development of muscle strength and hypertrophy. However, the studies in this area are inconclusive and do not relate precisely to various tempos and movement speeds. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of duration of the eccentric cadence ECC(REG) (2/0/X/0) and ECC(SLO) (6/0/X/0) on muscular power generated in the concentric phase of the movement expressed in maximal P(MAX), V(MAX) and average values P(AVE), V(AVE.) For the ECC(SLO) (6/0/X/0) cadence, a significantly lower value of P (401.95 ± 65.42 W) was observed compared to the ECC(REG) 2/0/X/0 tempo (467.65 ± 79.18 W), at p = 0.007. The same was true for power evaluated in maximal values (P(MAX)), as significantly higher values were recorded for the regular ECC(REG) (2/0/X/0) (671.55 ± 115.79 W) compared to the slow tempo ECC(SLO) (6/0/X/0) (565,70 ± 117,37 W), at the level of significance of p = 0.007. The velocity evaluated for ECC(REG) (2/0/X/0) tempo expressed in average values (V(AVE)) 0.60±0.09 m/s was significantly higher compared to the ECC(SLO) (6/0/X/0) tempo (0.52 ± 0.08 m/s), with p=0.004. When maximal velocity (V(MAX)), was considered higher values for ECC(REG) (2/0/X/0) tempo was registered (0.79 ± 0.10 m/s) compared to the ECC(SLO) (6/0/X/0) tempo (0.69 ± 0.13 m/s), at significance of p = 0.001. The main finding of the study indicates that the duration of the eccentric phase of the movement has a significant impact on muscular power and velocity during the concentric phase of the movement.",2019,18,2,191-197,,#3194,Wilk 2019,Resistance exercise
513,1852117.0,CGRP and ANF cause relaxation of opossum internal anal sphincter via different mechanisms.,Am J Physiol,"This investigation examined and compared the role of cyclic nucleotides in the mediation of internal anal sphincter (IAS) relaxation caused by the addition of neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF). The studies were performed in vitro on smooth muscle strips of opossum IAS. The relaxation produced by CGRP and ANF was examined before and after the addition of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 x 10(-6)M). At this concentration, TTX did not have any significant effect on the relaxation produced by either CGRP or ANF, suggesting that these peptides act directly on the smooth muscle. Addition of CGRP (3 x 10(-6) M) produced the maximal relaxation and significantly increased cAMP content without changing cGMP. On the other hand, addition of ANF (3 x 10(-6) M) caused a similar fall in IAS tension that was accompanied by a significant elevation in cGMP without any change in cAMP content. The rises in the levels of cyclic nucleotides preceded the onset of fall in the resting tension of IAS. Our results demonstrate that CGRP and ANF relax isolated strips of opossum IAS by their action directly at the smooth muscle and that this relaxation is associated with an increase in cAMP and cGMP, respectively. The studies suggest the presence of both cAMP and cGMP pathways in the IAS and that the relaxation of IAS smooth muscle in response to different peptides may occur via a specific intracellular biochemical pathway.",1991,260,5 Pt 1,G764-9,10.1152/ajpgi.1991.260.5.G764,#3195,Rattan 1991,

The aims of this study were to examine the vasorelaxant effects of three phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitors, olprinone, milrinone and amrinone, on isolated gastroepiploic arterial preparations in comparison with a calcium channel blocker diltiazem, and to confirm the mRNA expression of PDE3A isoenzyme using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the human gastroepiploic artery isolated from stomach removed in cancer surgery. In endothelium-denuded gastroepiploic arterial preparations, phenylephrine (100 microM) produced spontaneous, rhythmical changes in tension consisting of repeated contraction and relaxation. Olprinone at a concentration of 10 microM (n=6) significantly inhibited the frequency (2.7+/-1.1 times/30 min vs. 6.2+/-0.7 times/30 min in the vehicle group), maximum tension (1.7+/-0.6 g vs. 3.6+/-0.6 g in the vehicle group) and minimum tension (0.6+/-0.2 g vs. 1.7+/-0.3 g in the vehicle group) of rhythmical changes. Such potency is comparable to that of diltiazem, but is stronger than milrinone and amrinone. RT-PCR using PDE3A- or PDE3B-specific oligonucleotide primer demonstrated the existence of PDE3A sequence in the gastroepiploic artery. These results suggest that olprinone, a potent PDE3A inhibitor, would be suitable for protecting against perioperative spasm during coronary artery bypass graft surgery.",2005,528,3-Jan,137-43,10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.10.047,#3197,Adachi 2005,
516,28070866.0,Finite Element Analysis of Patient-Specific Mitral Valve with Mitral Regurgitation.,Cardiovasc Eng Technol,"Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is a significant complication of left ventricular dysfunction and strongly associated with a poor prognosis. In this study, we developed a patient-specific finite element (FE) model of the mitral apparatus in a FMR patient which included: both leaflets with thickness, annulus, chordae tendineae, and chordae insertions on the leaflets and origins on the papillary muscles. The FE model incorporated human age- and gender-matched anisotropic hyperelastic material properties, and MV closure at systole was simulated. The model was validated by comparing the FE results from valve closure simulation with the in vivo geometry of the MV at systole. It was found that the FE model could not replicate the in vivo MV geometry without the application of tethering pre-tension force in the chordae at diastole. Upon applying the pre-tension force and performing model optimization by adjusting the chordal length, position, and leaflet length, a good agreement between the FE model and the in vivo model was established. Not only were the chordal forces high at both diastole and systole, but the tethering force on the anterior papillary muscle was higher than that of the posterior papillary muscle, which resulted in an asymmetrical gap with a larger orifice area at the anterolateral commissure resulting in MR. The analyses further show that high peak stress and strain were found at the chordal insertions where large chordal tethering forces were found. This study shows that the pre-tension tethering force plays an important role in accurately simulating the MV dynamics in this FMR patient, particularly in quantifying the degree of leaflet coaptation and stress distribution. Due to the complexity of the disease, the patient-specific computational modeling procedure of FMR patients presented should be further evaluated using a large patient cohort. However, this study provides useful insights into the MV biomechanics of a FMR patient, and could serve as a tool to assist in pre-operative planning for MV repair or replacement surgical or interventional procedures.",2017,8,1,16-Mar,10.1007/s13239-016-0291-9,#3198,Pham 2017,Chordae tendineae
517,31471661.0,[Preoperative conditioning and surgical strategies for treatment of complex abdominal wall hernias].,Chirurg,"The successful treatment of complex abdominal wall hernias requires individualized and if necessary interdisciplinary treatment concepts. Due to the high potential for abdominal and cardiopulmonary complications, specialized centers with a high level of expertise and experience should undertake the care of patients. Prehabilitation and optimization of hernia-specific risk factors and comorbidities play an essential role in the treatment algorithm. Preoperative conditioning prior to surgery can be crucial for success. Bariatric surgery for weight loss and administration of botulinum toxin A in the lateral abdominal wall for stretching the musculature to provide myofascial advancement and enlargement of the torso diameter are parts of such strategies. The preoperative progressive pneumoperitoneum has its justification in massive evisceration, facilitates repositioning of the viscera and helps the patient to slowly adapt to the postoperatively changed abdominal pressure conditions. From a surgical technical point of view, the following principle should apply: ""mesh augmentation comes before defect bridging"". This means preference should be given to a morphological functional restoration of the myofascicular abdominal wall compared to procedures that merely bridge abdominal wall defects based on meshing. The retromuscular preperitoneal mesh strengthening in the sense of a sublay technique is the gold standard. This can be extended to anterior or posterior component separation techniques in order to achieve a reduction of tension to the midline and/or to achieve enlargement of the space for mesh placement.",2020,91,2,134-142,10.1007/s00104-019-01027-3,#3199,KÃ¶hler 2020,Abdominal wall defects
518,28915917.0,Translocation of molecular chaperones to the titin springs is common in skeletal myopathy patients and affects sarcomere function.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Myopathies encompass a wide variety of acquired and hereditary disorders. The pathomechanisms include structural and functional changes affecting, e.g., myofiber metabolism and contractile properties. In this study, we observed increased passive tension (PT) of skinned myofibers from patients with myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) caused by FLNC mutations (MFM-filaminopathy) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type-2A due to CAPN3 mutations (LGMD2A), compared to healthy control myofibers. Because the giant protein titin determines myofiber PT, we measured its molecular size and the titin-to-myosin ratio, but found no differences between myopathies and controls. All-titin phosphorylation and site-specific phosphorylation in the PEVK region were reduced in myopathy, which would be predicted to lower PT. Electron microscopy revealed extensive ultrastructural changes in myofibers of various hereditary myopathies and also suggested massive binding of proteins to the sarcomeric I-band region, presumably heat shock proteins (HSPs), which can translocate to elastic titin under stress conditions. Correlative immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy showed that two small HSPs (HSP27 and αB-crystallin) and the ATP-dependent chaperone HSP90 translocated to the titin springs in myopathy. The small HSPs, but not HSP90, were upregulated in myopathic versus control muscles. The titin-binding pattern of chaperones was regularly observed in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), LGMD2A, MFM-filaminopathy, MFM-myotilinopathy, titinopathy, and inclusion body myopathy due to mutations in valosin-containing protein, but not in acquired sporadic inclusion body myositis. The three HSPs also associated with elastic titin in mouse models of DMD and MFM-filaminopathy. Mechanical measurements on skinned human myofibers incubated with exogenous small HSPs suggested that the elevated PT seen in myopathy is caused, in part, by chaperone-binding to the titin springs. Whereas this interaction may be protective in that it prevents sarcomeric protein aggregation, it also has detrimental effects on sarcomere function. Thus, we identified a novel pathological phenomenon common to many hereditary muscle disorders, which involves sarcomeric alterations.",2017,5,1,72,10.1186/s40478-017-0474-0,#3200,Unger 2017,Immunoelectron microscopy
519,17164473.0,Sirolimus causes relaxation of human vascular smooth muscle: a novel action of sirolimus mediated via ATP-sensitive potassium channels.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"Little is known about the vasomotor effects of sirolimus, and preliminary studies using animal models have provided conflicting results. The present study was designed to determine the effects of sirolimus on vasomotor tone in human blood vessels. Human radial artery segments were cut into rings, denuded of endothelium, and placed into organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Sirolimus (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) caused concentration-dependent relaxation of human arteries contracted with U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-11alpha,9alpha-epoxymethano-prostaglandin F(2alpha); 10(-8) M) [-log (M) EC(50) (pD(2)) = 7.28 +/- 0.1; E(max) = 57 +/- 6%] or phenylephrine (10(-6) M) (pD(2) = 7.16 +/- 0.4; E(max) = 45 +/- 9%). Sirolimus-induced relaxation was unaffected by treatment with indomethacin (10(-5) M) but was nearly abolished in tissues contracted by depolarization with elevated K(+) (60 mM). In U46619-contracted rings, the response to sirolimus was markedly inhibited in the presence of the specific ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel blocker, glyburide (10(-6) M), but was unaffected by treatment with blockers of large conductance, calcium-activated potassium channel (iberiotoxin, 10(-7) M), small conductance, calcium-activated potassium channel (apamin, 10(-6) M), or voltage-gated potassium channel (4-aminopyridine, 10(-3) M). The K(ATP) channel opener, aprikalim (10(-7) to 10(-5) M), caused concentration-dependent relaxations that were inhibited by glyburide (10(-6) M) and abolished in tissues contracted with elevated K(+) (60 mM), thus confirming that K(ATP) channel opening causes relaxation of these arteries. These data suggest that sirolimus, at concentrations attained in vivo, causes relaxation of human arteries, and this effect is mediated by opening of K(ATP) channels in vascular smooth muscle. Reduced vasomotor tone is a heretofore unrecognized action of sirolimus that could potentially contribute to its efficacy in drug-eluting stents.",2007,320,3,1204-8,10.1124/jpet.106.115329,#3201,Ghatta 2007,

Concomitant with these studies, scientific investigations into the transcriptional regulation of myoglobin expression have been undertaken. These studies have indicated that activation of key transcription factors (MEF2, NFAT and Sp1) and co-activators (PGC-1alpha) by locomotor activity, differential intracellular calcium fluxes and low intracellular oxygen tension collectively regulate myoglobin expression. Future studies focused on tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory pathways and post-translational modifications governing myoglobin expression will need to be undertaken.

When mepyramine was added after maximal contraction with histamine, a relaxation occurred that could be blocked by adding cimetidine prior to mepyramine.

The purpose of this study was to identify the stretching positions that specifically applied the greatest passive tension on the posterior shoulder capsule by evaluating the elastic characteristics of posterior capsules and muscles in various stretching positions using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE). METHODS: We evaluated 9 fresh-frozen shoulders (mean age 86.6 ± 7.7 years) without osteoarthritis or rotator cuff tears. All posterior shoulder tissues were preserved intact. Shear moduli of the middle and inferior posterior shoulder capsules and the posterior shoulder muscles were evaluated using SWE. We obtained shear modulus measurements in 9 stretching positions using a combination of glenohumeral elevation planes and angles (frontal, sagittal, scapular; -30°, 0°, 30°, 60°, respectively). A 4-Nm torque for shoulder internal rotation or horizontal adduction was applied in each position. We also measured shear moduli in the resting position (0° elevation with neutral shoulder internal/external rotation). We compared the shear moduli of all stretching and resting positions using 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance (P < .05). In addition, we compared the shear modulus in 2 positions (ie, resting and each stretching) among tissues (ie, capsules and muscles) with repeated measures using 2-way analysis of variance (P < .05). RESULTS: Shear modulus values for the middle posterior capsules in ""internal rotation at 30° in scapular plane elevation"" (28.7 ± 14.3 kPa, P = .01) and in ""horizontal adduction at 60° of elevation"" (31.1 ± 13.1 kPa, P < .001) were significantly higher than that of the resting position (11.0 ± 7.3 kPa). The shear modulus value for the inferior posterior capsule in ""internal rotation at 30° of flexion"" was significantly higher than that of the resting position (39.0 ± 17.3 vs. 15.4 ± 13.9 kPa, respectively; P = .004). Additionally, the shear modulus values for the posterior capsules in ""internal rotation at 30° in scapular plane elevation and flexion"" were significantly higher than that of the posterior shoulder muscles. CONCLUSION: Effective middle posterior shoulder capsule stretching positions were shoulder ""internal rotation at 30° of scapular plane elevation"" and ""horizontal adduction at 60° of elevation."" Shoulder ""internal rotation at 30° of flexion"" was the most effective position for the inferior posterior shoulder capsule. Stretching in these positions could relieve posterior shoulder capsule tightness and contribute to the prevention and treatment of throwing injuries of the shoulder.",2021,30,5,1186-1195,10.1016/j.jse.2020.08.021,#3204,Iida 2021,Baseball

At the histopathological level, 3 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion was associated with an increase in hind limb girth, cross-sectional area, and weight and presence of neutrophils, as well as histological damage in more than 60% of muscle fibres. Our model allows to reliably reproduce the damage associated with the use of a pneumatic tourniquet. CK and LDH, as well as measures of tissue damage, allow to define and characterize the response to LL-IRI-related damage.

The aim was to establish the contribution of the four EP receptor types (EP(1-4) ), in human colon, that mediate PGE(2) -induced longitudinal smooth muscle contraction. METHODS: Changes in isometric muscle tension of human colon, mouse colon and mouse ileum were measured in organ baths in response to receptor-specific agonists and antagonists. In addition, lidocaine was used to block neurogenic activity to investigate whether EP receptors were pre- or post-junctional. KEY RESULTS: PGE(2) contracted longitudinal muscle from human and mouse colon and mouse ileum. These contractions were inhibited by the EP(1) receptor antagonist, EP(1) A in human colon, whereas a combination of EP(1) A and the EP(3) antagonist, L798106 inhibited agonist responses in both mouse preparations. The EP(3) agonist, sulprostone also increased muscle tension in both mouse tissues, and these responses were inhibited by lidocaine in the colon but not in the ileum. Although PGE(2) consistently contracted all three muscle preparations, butaprost decreased tension by activating smooth muscle EP(2) receptors in both colonic tissues. Alternatively, in mouse ileum, butaprost responses were lidocaine-sensitive, suggesting that it was activating prejunctional EP(2) receptors on inhibitory motor neurons. Conversely, EP(4) receptors were not functional in all the intestinal muscle preparations tested.

Force-velocity relationships were determined from isotonic contractions of 94 maximally activated fibres. Peak power (±SD) was 3.50±1.64 WL(-1). There was a tenfold range of peak power and five-, six- and fourfold ranges for Po, Vmax and a/Po, respectively. None of the differences between fibres was explicable by differences in myosin heavy or light chain composition. The inverse relationship between a/Po and Vmax suggests a similar underlying cause. Fitting the data to the Huxley (Progr Biophys Biophys Chem 7:255-318, 1957) cross-bridge model showed that the rate constant g (2) and the sum of the rate constants (f+g(1)) co-varied, both being low in the slowest fibres.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 109 male patients, 58 of them with SDANS, and 51 were healthy subjects. The patients with SDANS had the following risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, in decreasing order: stress (71% of cases), low physical activity (59%), smoking (57%), overweight and obesity (43%), anxiety (41%), low consumption of vegetables and fruit (36%), lack of extra aerobic physical activity (36%), excessive alcohol consumption (34%), depression (26%), total cholesterol ≥5 mmol/L (23%), and heart rate ≥80 (9% of the cases). All the subjects underwent clinical examination, laboratory investigation, ECG, ECG dispersion mapping, heart rate variability monitoring. RESULTS: Using the method of ECG dispersion mapping allowed a way for diagnosing pre-nosological changes in the electrophysiological state of the myocardium in male patients with SDANS, the basis of the pathogenesis of which is formed by the tension of the regulatory systems. Correlation between the total score according to the developed method, the RRNN value after 4 min of staying in orthostasis, and the ""Myocardium"" integral index has been proved. The diagnostic sensitivity of the proposed method with a threshold score of 8 was 80%, specificity - 70.8%. CONCLUSION: The developed method for assessing pre-nosological changes in the electrophysiological state of the myocardium which includes cardiovascular risk factors with a reclassifying potential, proves the development of pre-nosological changes in patients with SDANS in response to daily physical strain. The changes are associated with the tension of the electrophysiological state of the myocardium, an increased activity of the sympathetic division of the ANS being one of its pathogenetic mechanisms.",2021,12,5,87-92,10.17691/stm2020.12.5.10,#3209,Esina 2021,ECG dispersion mapping
528,10037432.0,Studies on the mechanisms involved in the ATP-induced relaxation in human and rabbit corpus cavernosum.,J Urol,"The effect of ATP in human and rabbit corpus cavernosum (CC) smooth muscle was investigated. Strips of human CC were vertically mounted in an organ bath and the tonic tension was recorded. ATP (0.1-3 mM) induced a concentration-dependent relaxant effect, with a pD2 value of 3.01+/-0.3. The purine-induced relaxation was not affected by L-NAME (100 microM). In rabbit CC, ATP also induced a concentration-dependent relaxation, which was not influenced by L-NAME or by indomethacin (3 microM), with a pD2 value of 3.1 +/-0.4. The ATP-induced relaxant effect in rabbit CC was increased by both the inhibitor of adenosine reuptake, dipyridamole (3 microM) and by the inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, EHNA (0.3 microM). Moreover CGS 15943 (3 microM), an A2a adenosine antagonist, reduced the ATP-induced relaxation. UTP was not able to produce relaxation. The two ATP analogues 2-methylthioATP and alpha,beta-methylene ATP were able to induce relaxation in rabbit CC, with the following order of potency: 2-methylthioATP > ATP > alpha,beta-methylene ATP thus suggesting a role for P2y receptors. However, reactive blue (500 microM), an unspecific P2y antagonist, did not modify the ATP relaxant response. The inhibition of phospholipase C by U73122 (3 microM) and of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase by thapsigargin (1 microM) did not modify the ATP-induced relaxation. The P2x specific antagonist PPADS (30 microM) and suramine (500 microM) were not able to modify the ATP relaxation either in the absence or presence of CGS 15943 (3 microM). These results confirm that ATP acts as a potent and NO-independent relaxant agent of human and rabbit CC. Our findings also show that the ATP effect is partially attributable to the metabolic breakdown of ATP to adenosine, which acts through A2a receptor stimulation, but is also due to a direct stimulation of P2 receptors that are different from the classical P2y and P2X receptor subtypes for ATP.",1999,161,1,326-31,,#3210,Filippi 1999,
529,19741023.0,The Borg dyspnoea score: a relevant clinical marker of inspiratory muscle weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,Eur Respir J,"The aim of the study was to determine whether the Borg dyspnoea scale could be a useful and simple marker to predict respiratory muscle weakness in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). From April 1997 to 2001, respiratory function was perfomed in 72 patients together with the Borg score in both the upright (uBorg) and supine (sBorg) positions. Mean upright vital capacity (VC) was 81+/-24% predicted, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) was 55+/-26% pred, maximal inspiratory pressure (P(I,max)) was 57+/-26% pred and arterial carbon dioxide tension (P(a,CO(2))) was 41+/-6 mmHg. The mean Borg scores in the upright and supine positions were 1.7+/-1.5 and 2.2+/-2, respectively. A significant relationship between SNIP and uBorg (r = 0.4; p = 0.0007) and SNIP and sBorg (r = 0.58; p<0.0001) was observed. Upright VC, DeltaVC (measured as the supine fall in VC as a percentage of seated VC), P(I,max) and P(a,CO(2)) were significantly correlated with SNIP. A cut-off value of 3 on the sBorg scale provided the best sensitivity (80%) and specificity (78%) (area under the curve 0.8) to predict a SNIP < or =40 cmH(2)O, indicating severe inspiratory muscle weakness. Patients with a sBorg score > or =3 also exhibited significantly lower VC, P(I,max) and twitch mouth pressure during cervical magnetic stimulation, and slightly higher P(a,CO(2)) (43.7+/-7 versus 39.2+/-5 mmHg; p = 0.05). The Borg dyspnoea scale is a valuable noninvasive test for the prediction of inspiratory muscle weakness in ALS patients.",2010,35,2,353-60,10.1183/09031936.00184908,#3211,Just 2010,
530,15818459.0,Effects of cilostazol on human venous smooth muscle.,Ann Vasc Surg,"In this study, we evaluated the effect of therapeutic doses of cilostazol on human venous smooth muscle. Saphenous vein rings (two to four per patient sample) were suspended in tissue baths for isometric tension recordings. At the beginning of the experiment, optimal tension for isometric contraction was achieved for each ring in a stepwise fashion in the presence of norepinephrine (10(-2) M). Norepinepherine was then added cumulatively in half-molar increments and isometric tension developed by the rings was measured, thereby obtaining a dose-response curve. Following washout and reequilibration, the rings were precontracted with a 30-50% submaximal dose of norepinepherine determined from the dose-response curve and allowed to contract until a stable plateau was reached. Cilostazol was then added in a cumulative manner (680-2,720 microg/L), and the tension generated was recorded. A total of 76 venous rings were tested, and all relaxed in the presence of cilostazol. The amount of relaxation increased as the concentration of cilostazol increased. Relaxation of 15 +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SEM) at low cilostazol doses (680 microg/L) to 37+/-3% at high cilostazol doses (2,720 microg/L) was demonstrated. A second finding of this study was demonstrated when the patient samples were divided according to the presence or absence of risk factors for arteriosclerosis. The specific risk factors examined included diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. The presence or absence of hypertension (n = 52) or hypercholesterolemia (n = 18) did not affect the amount of relaxation of the venous rings. Smokers (n = 46) had less relaxation 16 +/- 2.4% (680 microg/L) to 41 +/- 3.6% (2,720 microg/L) compared to nonsmokers (n = 53) who relaxed 22 +/- 3.5% (680 microg/L) to 48 +/- 5.7% (2720 microg/L). This did not reach statistical significance at any concentration cilostazol (p = 0.11-0.18). Diabetics (n = 53) did have statistically significantly less relaxation at every concentration of cilostazol compared to nondiabetics (n = 11, p < 0.05). All venous rings relaxed in the presence of cilostazol. Veins of nondiabetics relaxed statistically significantly more than those of diabetics. Smokers had less relaxation than non-smokers, but this was not statistically significant. We are the first to demonstrate that human venous smooth muscle cells undergo relaxation when exposed to therapeutic concentrations of cilostazol.",2005,19,3,393-7,10.1007/s10016-005-0012-6,#3212,Becker 2005,

This study investigated Ca(2+ )sensitivity of tension and myosin-ATPase activity in skinned fiber preparations of male and female wildtype (WT; n = 12) and transgenic mice with a cardiac specific overexpression of the Galphaq-protein (Galphaq-OE; n = 11). In addition, the phosphorylation status of troponin I was measured. Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension was increased in Galphaq-OE with a significant reduction in the half-maximum Ca(2+) concentration (EC(50)) compared to WT. Similarly, Ca(2+) sensitivity of myosin ATPase activity was increased in Galphaq-OE when comparing Galphaq-OE to WT. Maximum Ca(2+)-dependent tension and ATPase activity were both enhanced in Galphaq-OE compared to WT littermates. Phosphorylation of troponin I was significantly reduced in Galphaq-OE compared to WT. In the above experiments, no gender specific differences were observed in either Gaq-OE or in WT. We conclude that, in mice, increased expression of the Galphaq-protein induces alterations of myofibrillar function and energy consumption, which are also characteristics of human heart failure. This may result from a decreased phosphorylation of troponin I in Galphaq-OE.",2008,314,2-Jan,133-41,10.1007/s11010-008-9774-9,#3213,Pott 2008,
532,9131289.0,Papaverive abolishes endothelium-dependent dilatation of human internal mammary arteries in vitro.,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,"1. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of papaverine-HCl, administered into the lumen of the human internal mammary artery (IMA) during harvesting of this vessel, on vascular reactivity in vitro and to specifically test the hypothesis that intraluminal administration of papaverine-HCl impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation. 2. The present study measured in vitro dilator and constrictor responses of terminal segments of human IMA. Internal mammary artery segments were obtained either prior to routine administration of intraluminal papaverine (pre-P) or after papaverine administration (post-P) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. In addition, the viability of cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells exposed to papaverine-HCl was examined. 3. Cumulative concentrations of U46619, 5-hydroxytryptamine and phenylephrine (PE) produced active contractions in post-P IMA rings. Contractile responses to low concentrations of endothelin-1 were significantly enhanced in post-PIMA compared with pre-P IMA segments. 4. Maximal endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses of pre-P IMA segments to cumulative concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) and the calcium ionophore A23187 were 49 +/- 7 and 66 +/- 4%, respectively, of the initial active tension induced by PE (1 mumol/L). 5. Maximal endothelium-dependent vasodilator responses were markedly attenuated in post-P IMA (6 +/- 6 and 11 +/- 10% for ACh and A23187, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both vasodilators compared with pre-P). Post-P IMA relaxed completely to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside. 6. Exposure of cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells to papaverine-HCl (1.2 and 12.0 mg/mL) for 1 h resulted in the reduced viability of these cells. 7. The loss of endothelium-dependent relaxation could dangerously predispose the IMA graft to vasospasm in the postoperative period.",1997,24,4-Mar,223-8,10.1111/j.1440-1681.1997.tb01811.x,#3214,Schyvens 1997,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight Swiss albino mice (30-40 g) of both sexes were anesthetized with tiopental sodium (30 mg/kg). After exsanguinations from abdominal artery, esophagi were removed and suspended under 0.6 g of resting tension in a tissue bath containing 10 mL of Krebs solution at 37 degrees C. The experiments were performed in different pH mediums 7.4, 6.4, 4, and 2. Carbachol and acetylcholine were used as contractile agonists, and noradrenalin and isoproterenol to evaluate relaxation responses. Data concerning similar concentrations of contractile agonists obtained from different pH mediums were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance and post hoc Dunn test. Relaxation responses were compared with Student t test. A P value less than .05 was considered significant. The study was approved by Local Ethical Committee of Kirikkale University. RESULTS: Carbachol and acetylcholine caused concentration-dependent contractility in pH 7.4, 6.4, and 4, but contractile responses were inhibited in pH 2. In carbachol and acetylcholine experiments, there was a significant decrease in contractile responses to all concentrations in conjunction with a decreased in pH value. Relaxation responses in pH 2 and 4 could not be obtained because precontraction of tissues was not possible. Noradrenalin and isoproterenol produced concentration-dependent relaxations in pH 7.4 and 6.4. Although noradrenalin responses showed no significant difference according to pH, isoproterenol caused better relaxations in pH 6.4 (between 10(-8) and 10(-6) mol/L) when compared to pH 7.4 studies. CONCLUSION: The mouse esophagus has impaired contractile responses to carbachol and acetylcholine in decreased pH values. Contraction responses did not occur in pH medium of 2. In contrast, esophagus segments showed better relaxations in lower pH values with isoproterenol.",2007,42,12,1988-92,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2007.08.006,#3215,Soyer 2007,
534,32931484.0,Modulating the tension-time integral of the cardiac twitch prevents dilated cardiomyopathy in murine hearts.,JCI Insight,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is often associated with sarcomere protein mutations that confer reduced myofilament tension-generating capacity. We demonstrated that cardiac twitch tension-time integrals can be targeted and tuned to prevent DCM remodeling in hearts with contractile dysfunction. We employed a transgenic murine model of DCM caused by the D230N-tropomyosin (Tm) mutation and designed a sarcomere-based intervention specifically targeting the twitch tension-time integral of D230N-Tm hearts using multiscale computational models of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in the thin filament and cell-level contractile simulations. Our models predicted that increasing the calcium sensitivity of thin filament activation using the cardiac troponin C (cTnC) variant L48Q can sufficiently augment twitch tension-time integrals of D230N-Tm hearts. Indeed, cardiac muscle isolated from double-transgenic hearts expressing D230N-Tm and L48Q cTnC had increased calcium sensitivity of tension development and increased twitch tension-time integrals compared with preparations from hearts with D230N-Tm alone. Longitudinal echocardiographic measurements revealed that DTG hearts retained normal cardiac morphology and function, whereas D230N-Tm hearts developed progressive DCM. We present a computational and experimental framework for targeting molecular mechanisms governing the twitch tension of cardiomyopathic hearts to counteract putative mechanical drivers of adverse remodeling and open possibilities for tension-based treatments of genetic cardiomyopathies.",2020,5,20,,10.1172/jci.insight.142446,#3216,Powers 2020,Cardiology

Skeletal muscle appears to be particularly vulnerable to genetic defects in basal and induced autophagy, indicating that autophagy is co-substantial to skeletal muscle maintenance and adaptation. We discuss emerging evidence that tension-induced protein unfolding may act as a direct link between mechanical stress and autophagic pathways. Mechanistic links between protein damage, autophagy and muscle hypertrophy, which is also induced by mechanical stress, are still poorly understood. However, some mouse models of muscle disease show ameliorated symptoms upon effective targeting of basal autophagy. These findings highlight the importance of autophagy as therapeutic target and suggest that elucidating connections between protein unfolding and mTOR-dependent or mTOR-independent hypertrophic responses is likely to reveal specific therapeutic windows for the treatment of muscle wasting disorders.",2016,27,12-Nov,525-537,10.1007/s00335-016-9659-2,#3217,Jokl 2016,

METHODS: We collected 50 muscle biopsies (26 vastus lateralis, 24 tibialis anterior) from 14 patients with genetically confirmed FSHD and 12 healthy controls. Single muscle fibers (n = 547) were isolated for contractile measurements. Titin content and titin phosphorylation were examined in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies. RESULTS: Single muscle fiber specific force was intact at saturating and physiologic calcium concentrations in all FSHD biopsies, with (FSHD(FAT)) and without (FSHD(NORMAL)) fatty infiltration, compared to healthy controls. Myofilament calcium sensitivity of force is increased in single muscle fibers obtained from FSHD muscle biopsies with increased fatty infiltration, but not in FSHD muscle biopsies without fatty infiltration (pCa(50): 5.77-5.80 in healthy controls, 5.74-5.83 in FSHD(NORMAL), and 5.86-5.90 in FSHD(FAT) single muscle fibers). Cross-bridge cycling kinetics at saturating calcium concentrations and myofilament cooperativity did not differ from healthy controls. Development of single muscle fiber passive tension was changed in all FSHD vastus lateralis and in FSHD(FAT) tibialis anterior, resulting in increased fiber stiffness. Titin content was increased in FSHD vastus lateralis biopsies; however, titin phosphorylation did not differ from healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Muscle weakness in patients with FSHD is not caused by reduced specific force of individual muscle fibers, even in severely affected tissue with marked fatty infiltration of muscle tissue.",2020,94,11,e1157-e1170,10.1212/WNL.0000000000008977,#3218,Lassche 2020,
537,6321585.0,Prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors in human and canine saphenous veins.,J Auton Nerv Syst,"Experiments were designed to compare the functional importance of prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors in human and canine blood vessels. Rings of saphenous veins were mounted for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with physiological salt solution. Isoproterenol caused concentration-dependent relaxations of comparable magnitude during contractions of canine veins caused by electrical stimulation or norepinephrine. In the human veins, isoproterenol caused smaller relaxations during norepinephrine-induced contractions, and augmented the contractile response to electrical stimulation. Helical strips of veins were incubated with [3H]norepinephrine and mounted for superfusion and isometric tension recording. Isoproterenol augmented the release of intact labeled transmitter during electrical stimulation more in the human than in the canine vein. In veins from both species the effects of isoproterenol were inhibited by propranolol. These experiments demonstrate that the adrenergic nerves of the human saphenous vein have a greater responsiveness to prejunctional beta-adrenergic activation than those of the corresponding canine vessel. As a consequence, in the human vein, beta-adrenergic agonists augment, rather than depress the contractile response to activation of the adrenergic nerve endings.",1983,8,3,261-71,10.1016/0165-1838(83)90109-1,#3219,Verbeuren 1983,
538,7888288.0,Interaction between endothelin and vasodilators in the human internal mammary artery.,Br J Clin Pharmacol,"1. The internal mammary artery (IMA) is the primary choice as an arterial graft for coronary artery bypass surgery. Endothelin (ET) has been recently measured with an increased release after cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass grafting. Threshold concentrations of ET-1 have been found to amplify specifically contractions induced by noradrenaline and serotonin. This study was designed to investigate the effect of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and calcium antagonists on ET-1 contraction in the human IMA. 2. Human IMA segments taken from 21 patients undergoing IMA-coronary artery bypass grafting were mounted in an organ bath under the physiological pressure determined from their own length-tension curves. Four ring segments were allocated into four groups. One served as a control and the others were treated with GTN (10, 100 nM, or 30 microM) for 5 min or nifedipine (20 or 200 nM, or 30 microM) for 25 min before concentration-contraction curves to ET-1 were established. In separate experiments, the concentration-relaxation curves to GTN or nifedipine were established in the IMA rings precontracted with ET-1 (10 nM). 3. Pretreatment of IMA with GTN for 5 min did not alter the ET-1-induced contraction. Pretreatment with 20 or 200 nM of nifedipine slightly but not significantly, altered the maximum contraction induced by ET-1. Higher concentrations (30 microM) significantly reduced the maximum contraction force (P = 0.008). On the other hand, GTN caused 76.44 +/- 6.35% relaxation in ET-1-precontracted IMA. In contrast, the nifedipine-induced relaxation was difficult to establish due to unsustained contraction to ET-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,38,6,505-12,10.1111/j.1365-2125.1994.tb04391.x,#3220,He 1994,

The ability of selective (pirenzepine, UH-AH 371, AF-DX 116, methoctramine, AQ-RA 741, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and hexahydro-sila-difenidol (HHSiD)) and non-selective (atropine) antagonists to inhibit the constriction elicited by ACh was estimated. In addition, using a subtype-specific ribonucleotide probe directed against mRNA encoding the human m1 (Hm1) muscarinic receptor, identification of the corresponding vascular receptor was undertaken in total RNA extracts from cat cerebral blood vessels. The potent inhibition of the ACh-induced constriction by M1 antagonists (pirenzepine and UH-AH 371; pA2 values respectively of 8.08 and 8.64), together with lower affinities of M2 (AF-DX 116; pA2 = 6.50, methoctramine; pA2 = 6.27 and AQ-RA 741; pA2 = 7.60) and M3 compounds (4-DAMP and HHSiD; with pA2 values of 8.85 and 7.76, respectively) strongly suggested the involvement of a pharmacological M1 receptor in this vasomotor response. Furthermore, Northern blot hybridization with the selective Hm1 ribonucleotide probe showed the presence of mRNA transcripts for this muscarinic receptor subtype in the cat cerebrovascular bed. The results indicate that muscarinic constriction in the feline cerebrovascular bed is mediated by a pharmacological M1 receptor subtype and that the corresponding m1 receptor mRNA is present in cat cerebral blood vessels. These findings clearly point to a role of M1 muscarinic receptors in cerebrovascular function.",1991,207,4,319-27,10.1016/0922-4106(91)90006-4,#3221,Dauphin 1991,

Rat aortic spiral strip preparations without endothelium were treated with the acetoxymethyl ester of fura 2, and the ratio of fluorescences (R340/380), an index of [Ca2+]i, emitted from smooth muscle, was measured. The tension of the preparations was simultaneously measured. PTHrP-(1-34) produced concentration-dependent decreases both in the tension and in R340/380 increased by phenylephrine (10(-7) M). These effects were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with either PTHrP-(7-34) (10(-6) M), a PTHrP receptor antagonist, or with Rp diastereomer of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate (RpcAMPS; 10(-4) M), a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-5)-10(-3.5 M) elicited effects similar to those of PTHrP-(1-34). PTHrP-(1-34) was found to significantly elevate aortic cAMP level, measured by specific radioimmunoassay, after 5 min incubation with PTHrP-(1-34). These results suggest that the decrease in [Ca2+]i is involved in the vasodilator action of PTHrP, and that the decreases both in tension and in [Ca2+]i might be attributed to cyclic AMP production stimulated by PTHrP.",1994,269,3,311-7,10.1016/0922-4106(94)90038-8,#3222,Ishikawa 1994,

RESULTS: Outcomes concerning pain, quality of life and Constant index were good and similar to other series. Few complications were observed. An increase of the acromio-epiphyseal distance of 33 to 50% compared to the non operated side is associated with a good functional result. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm those of other series and show that Delta 3 inverted prosthesis is an efficient therapeutic alternative in arthropathy with rotator cuff tears.

A novel method infers esophageal neuromechanical wall states through simultaneous determination of pressure and diameter in vivo using impedance manometry. We hypothesized that changes in esophageal neuromechanical wall states relate to conscious awareness of esophageal bolus passage (""bolus perception""). Seven healthy participants were selected for perception of solid bolus passage and were compared with seven healthy participants with no conscious awareness of solid bolus passage. Participants were studied using impedance manometry (MMS Solar, Unisensor, 20 Hz). Subjects swallowed ten 5-ml liquid and ten 2-cm square saline-soaked bread boluses and rated bolus perception using a visual analog scale. Esophageal neuromechanical wall states were calculated and analyzed. Proportions of time spent in states with and without luminal distension were compared using a two-proportions Z-test. Bolus perception was associated with neuromechanical wall states corresponding to luminal distension more frequently than matching states without distension in the proximal esophagus (P < 0.001) and transition zone (P < 0.001), whereas there were no differences for the distal esophagus. In healthy volunteers, perceived swallows relate to changes in esophageal neuromechanical wall states in the proximal esophagus. We postulate that these changes relate to bolus retention and summation of active and passive wall tension activating intramural tension receptors.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study explores esophageal neuromechanical wall states derived from changes in pressure and impedance-derived distension in relation to conscious awareness of esophageal solid bolus transit in healthy volunteers. There are increases in neuromechanical wall states indicative of esophageal distension in healthy volunteers with conscious awareness of bolus transit as compared with unaware individuals. Bolus-based esophageal distension is postulated as a mechanism for esophageal symptoms such as dysphagia.",2020,318,5,G946-G954,10.1152/ajpgi.00235.2019,#3224,Cock 2020,bolus perception
543,33806419.0,Hypoxic Conditions Promote Rhythmic Contractile Oscillations Mediated by Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Activation in Human Arteries.,Int J Mol Sci,"Arterial smooth muscle exhibits rhythmic oscillatory contractions called vasomotion and believed to be a protective mechanism against tissue hypoperfusion or hypoxia. Oscillations of vascular tone depend on voltage and follow oscillations of the membrane potential. Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(v)), responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells, have also been evidenced both in animal and human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). For example, they contribute to arterial contraction in rats, but their physiopathological relevance has not been established in human vessels. In the present study, we investigated the functional role of Na(v) in the human artery. Experiments were performed on human uterine arteries obtained after hysterectomy and on SMCs dissociated from these arteries. In SMCs, we recorded a tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive and fast inactivating voltage-dependent I(Na) current. Various Na(v) genes, encoding α-subunit isoforms sensitive (Na(v) 1.2; 1.3; 1.7) and resistant (Na(v) 1.5) to TTX, were detected both in arterial tissue and in SMCs. Na(v) channels immunostaining showed uniform distribution in SMCs and endothelial cells. On arterial tissue, we recorded variations of isometric tension, ex vivo, in response to various agonists and antagonists. In arterial rings placed under hypoxic conditions, the depolarizing agent KCl and veratridine, a specific Na(v) channels agonist, both induced a sustained contraction overlaid with rhythmic oscillations of tension. After suppression of sympathetic control either by blocking the release of catecholamine or by antagonizing the target adrenergic response, rhythmic activity persisted while the sustained contraction was abolished. This rhythmic activity of the arteries was suppressed by TTX but, in contrast, only attenuated by antagonists of calcium channels, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and the cardiac Na(v) channel. These results highlight the role of Na(v) as a novel key element in the vasomotion of human arteries. Hypoxia promotes activation of Na(v) channels involved in the initiation of rhythmic oscillatory contractile activity.",2021,22,5,,10.3390/ijms22052570,#3225,Virsolvy 2021,human arteries

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: µ-CnIIIC was sequenced, synthesized and characterized by its direct block of elicited twitch tension in mouse skeletal muscle and action potentials in mouse sciatic and pike olfactory nerves. µ-CnIIIC was also studied on HEK-293 cells expressing various rodent VGSCs and also on voltage-gated potassium channels and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to assess cross-interactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were carried out for structural data. KEY RESULTS: Synthetic µ-CnIIIC decreased twitch tension in mouse hemidiaphragms (IC(50) = 150 nM), and displayed a higher blocking effect in mouse extensor digitorum longus muscles (IC = 46 nM), compared with µ-SIIIA, µ-SmIIIA and µ-PIIIA. µ-CnIIIC blocked Na(V)1.4 (IC(50) = 1.3 nM) and Na(V)1.2 channels in a long-lasting manner. Cardiac Na(V)1.5 and DRG-specific Na(V)1.8 channels were not blocked at 1 µM. µ-CnIIIC also blocked the α3β2 nAChR subtype (IC(50) = 450 nM) and, to a lesser extent, on the α7 and α4β2 subtypes. Structure determination of µ-CnIIIC revealed some similarities to α-conotoxins acting on nAChRs. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: µ-CnIIIC potently blocked VGSCs in skeletal muscle and nerve, and hence is applicable to myorelaxation. Its atypical pharmacological profile suggests some common structural features between VGSCs and nAChR channels.",2012,166,5,1654-68,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.01837.x,#3227,Favreau 2012,
546,23324873.0,Respiratory muscle tension as symptom generator in individuals with high anxiety sensitivity.,Psychosom Med,"OBJECTIVE: Anxiety and panic are associated with the experience of a range of bodily symptoms, in particular unpleasant breathing sensations (dyspnea). Respiratory theories of panic disorder have focused on disturbances in blood gas regulation, but respiratory muscle tension as a source of dyspnea has not been considered. We therefore examined the potential of intercostal muscle tension to elicit dyspnea in individuals with high anxiety sensitivity, a risk factor for developing panic disorder. METHODS: Individuals high and low in anxiety sensitivity (total N=62) completed four tasks: electromyogram biofeedback for tensing intercostal muscle, electromyogram biofeedback for tensing leg muscles, paced breathing at three different speeds, and a fine motor task. Global dyspnea, individual respiratory sensations, nonrespiratory sensations, and discomfort were assessed after each task, whereas respiratory pattern (respiratory inductance plethysmography) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (capnography) were measured continuously. RESULTS: In individuals with high compared to low anxiety sensitivity, intercostal muscle tension elicited a particularly strong report of obstruction (M=5.1, SD=3.6 versus M=2.5, SD=3.0), air hunger (M=1.9, SD=2.1 versus M=0.4, SD=0.8), hyperventilation symptoms (M=0.6, SD=0.6 versus M=0.1, SD=0.1), and discomfort (M=5.1, SD=3.2 versus M=2.2, SD=2.1) (all p values<.05). This effect was not explained by site-unspecific muscle tension, voluntary manipulation of respiration, or sustained task-related attention. Nonrespiratory control sensations were not significantly affected by tasks (F<1), and respiratory variables did not reflect any specific responding of high-Anxiety Sensitivity Index participants to intercostal muscle tension. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory muscle tension may contribute to the respiratory sensations experienced by panic-prone individuals. Theories and treatments for panic disorder should consider this potential source of symptoms.",2013,75,2,187-95,10.1097/PSY.0b013e31827d1072,#3228,Ritz 2013,
547,11061437.0,Integrin function and regulation in development.,Int J Dev Biol,"Integrins are a large family of membrane receptors, consisting of alpha and beta subunits, that play a pivotal role in the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix. Such interaction regulates the organization of cells in organs and tissues during development as well as cell differentiation and proliferation. We have shown that unfertilized oocytes express integrins that might be important during fertilization. We also analyzed nervous system and muscle tissue development showing that integrin expression is precisely regulated during organization of these tissues. The results indicate that two distinct integrin alpha subunits mediate the outgrowth of processes in nerve and glial cells. Alpha1 integrin, a laminin receptor, is up-regulated by nerve growth factor and other differentiation stimuli and is involved in neurite extension by nerve cells. In contrast, process extension by glial cells is likely to involve the alphaV integrin. Moreover, the latter integrin subunit is also transiently expressed in muscle of the embryo body where it localizes predominantly at developing myotendinous junctions. After birth this integrin disappears and is substituted by the alpha7 subunit. At the same time, important changes also occur in the expression of the associated beta subunit. In fact, the beta1A isoform which is expressed in fetal muscles, is substituted by beta1D. These isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and differ in only a few amino acid residues at the COOH terminus of the protein. This region of the molecule is exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and is connected to the actin filaments. Our results show that beta1D, which is expressed only in striated muscle tissues, binds to both cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins with an affinity higher than beta1A. Thus, beta1D provides a stronger link between the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix necessary to support mechanical tension during muscle contraction. These results indicate that cells can regulate their interactions with the extracellular matrix by changing their expression of alpha integrin subunits and thus ligand specificity, or by more subtle changes involving alternative usage of different cytoplasmic domains. The important role of both alpha and beta integrin subunit cytoplasmic domains during development is further illustrated by the analysis of targeted mutations which we have generated by homologous recombination in mice.",2000,44,6,725-31,,#3229,Tarone 2000,
548,21821730.0,Improved bioavailability of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids reduces TP-receptor agonist-induced tension in human bronchi.,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) and thromboxane A(2) are arachidonic acid derivatives. The former has initially been defined as an epithelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor displaying broncho-relaxing and anti-inflammatory properties, as recently demonstrated, whereas thromboxane A(2) induces vaso- and bronchoconstriction upon binding to thromboxane-prostanoid (TP)-receptor. EETs, however, are quickly degraded by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) into inactive diol compounds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 14,15-EET on TP-receptor activation in human bronchi. Tension measurements performed on native bronchi from various species, acutely treated with increasing 14,15-EET concentrations, revealed specific and concentration-dependent relationships as well as a decrease in the tension induced by 30 nM U-46619, used as a synthetic TP-receptor agonist. Interestingly, acute treatments with 3 μM N-(methylsulfonyl)-2-(2-propynyloxy)-benzenehexanamide, an epoxygenase inhibitor, which minimizes endogenous production of EET, resulted in an increased reactivity to U-46619. Furthermore, we demonstrated that chronic treatments with trans-4-[4-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-cyclohexyloxy]-benzoic acid (t-AUCB), a sEH inhibitor, reduced human bronchi reactivity to U-46619. During our tension measurements, we also observed that human bronchi generated small-amplitude contractions; these spontaneous activities were reduced upon acute 14,15-EET treatments in the presence of t-AUCB. Altogether, these data demonstrate that endogenous and exogenous 14,15-EET could interfere with the activation of TP-receptors as well as with spontaneous oscillations in human airway smooth muscle tissues.",2011,301,5,L675-82,10.1152/ajplung.00427.2010,#3230,Senouvo 2011,
549,9051150.0,Human prostatic smooth muscle cells in culture: estradiol enhances expression of smooth muscle cell-specific markers.,Prostate,"Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) constitute a major cellular component of prostatic stroma. SMC tension plays an important role in urethral obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). We have developed an in vitro procedure for the propagation of human prostatic SMCs. Tissue specimens from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or cystectomy were enzymatically disaggregated and cultured in MCDB-131 medium supplemented with horse serum, insulin, conditioned medium from the tumor cell line CRL-5813, and steroid hormones. The medium was assembled on the basis of the effects these supplements have on the growth of SMC cultures and on the expression of the two markers desmin and smooth muscle myosin. Addition of 0.1 microM of estradiol to the growth medium dramatically increased expression of these SMC-specific markers. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and hydrocortisone had a similar, albeit less pronounced effect. At three to five passages, about two thirds of the cells were immunohistologically positive for smooth muscle myosin or desmin. Almost all cells were positive for the myofibroblast marker smooth muscle alpha-actin throughout 10 passages and more. In SMC cultures, cells staining for smooth muscle myosin and desmin were found to seek direct contact to myofibroblasts. They grew in aggregates on a layer of myofibroblasts which adhered to the surface of the culture vessel. As revealed by transmission electron microscopy the cultured cells exhibited morphological features of myofibroblasts. Characteristics of smooth muscle cells, such as prominent bundles of microfilaments associated with dense bodies, basal laminae investing the cells, and numerous caveolae at the cell surfaces were regularly observed in cultures of low passages. After several passages, these features were markedly decreased and organelles of the biosynthetic system became more prominent. In summary, we present an in vitro model of prostatic SMCs and demonstrate that steroid hormones have characteristic effects on these cells. SMC cultures are expected to facilitate investigation of the functions and properties of human prostatic SMCs.",1997,30,2,117-29,10.1002/(sici)1097-0045(19970201)30:2<117::aid-pros7>3.0.co;2-l,#3231,Zhang 1997,
550,31446446.0,Contractile elements and their sympathetic regulations in the pig urinary bladder: a species and regional comparative study.,Cell Tissue Res,"Contractile behaviour of the urinary bladder and its sympathetic inhibition during storage phases are not well understood. Here, we explore muscularis mucosae (MM) as a predominant mucosal contractile element and the capability of sympathetic nerves to relax detrusor smooth muscle (DSM) or MM. Distribution of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)-immunoreactive cells was compared in pig, human, guinea pig, rat and mouse bladders by immunohistochemistry, while contractility of the bladder mucosa was compared in these species by isometric tension recordings. In pig, human and guinea pig bladders, DSM and MM located in the lamina propria expressed α-SMA immunoreactivity, while both rat and mouse bladders lacked a MM. Consistent with this presence or absence of MM, bladder mucosa of pig, human and guinea pig but not rat and mouse developed spontaneous phasic contractions (SPCs). Distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive sympathetic nerve fibres was compared in pig DSM, MM, trigone and urethra, as were their sympathetic nerve-evoked contractile/relaxing responses examined. In pig DSM or MM, where TH-immunoreactive sympathetic fibres exclusively projected to the vasculature, sympathetic relaxations were difficult to demonstrate. In contrast, sympathetic contractions were invariably evoked in pig trigone and urethra where the smooth muscle cells receive TH-immunoreactive sympathetic innervations. Thus, SPCs of bladder mucosa appear to predominantly arise from the MM displaying species differences. Despite the currently accepted concept of sympathetic nerve-mediated DSM relaxation during the storage phase, it is unlikely that neurally released noradrenaline acts on β-adrenoceptors to relax either DSM or MM due to the anatomical lack of sympathetic innervation.",2020,379,2,373-387,10.1007/s00441-019-03088-6,#3232,Mitsui 2020,Muscularis mucosae
551,15514163.0,Protein kinase D is a novel mediator of cardiac troponin I phosphorylation and regulates myofilament function.,Circ Res,"Protein kinase D (PKD) is a serine kinase whose myocardial substrates are unknown. Yeast 2-hybrid screening of a human cardiac library, using the PKD catalytic domain as bait, identified cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), and telethonin as PKD-interacting proteins. In vitro phosphorylation assays revealed PKD-mediated phosphorylation of cTnI, cMyBP-C, and telethonin, as well as myomesin. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis of cTnI by liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry indicated PKD-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide containing Ser22 and Ser23, the protein kinase A (PKA) targets. Ser22 and Ser23 were replaced by Ala, either singly (Ser22Ala or Ser23Ala) or jointly (Ser22/23Ala), and the troponin complex reconstituted in vitro, using wild-type or mutated cTnI together with wild-type cardiac troponin C and troponin T. PKD-mediated cTnI phosphorylation was reduced in complexes containing Ser22Ala or Ser23Ala cTnI and completely abolished in the complex containing Ser22/23Ala cTnI, indicating that Ser22 and Ser23 are both targeted by PKD. Furthermore, troponin complex containing wild-type cTnI was phosphorylated with similar kinetics and stoichiometry (approximately 2 mol phosphate/mol cTnI) by both PKD and PKA. To determine the functional impact of PKD-mediated phosphorylation, Ca2+ sensitivity of tension development was studied in a rat skinned ventricular myocyte preparation. PKD-mediated phosphorylation did not affect maximal tension but produced a significant rightward shift of the tension-pCa relationship, indicating reduced myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. At submaximal Ca2+ activation, PKD-mediated phosphorylation also accelerated isometric crossbridge cycling kinetics. Our data suggest that PKD is a novel mediator of cTnI phosphorylation at the PKA sites and may contribute to the regulation of myofilament function.",2004,95,11,1091-9,10.1161/01.RES.0000149299.34793.3c,#3233,Haworth 2004,
552,9706292.0,Arthritis of dislocation.,Orthop Clin North Am,"Arthritis of dislocation is a unique form of degenerative joint disease involving the shoulder. It seems that a larger number of patients who develop arthritis of dislocation have had prior instability repairs. In studying large numbers of patients, several factors seem to recur. Careful, repeated examinations of both symptomatic and asymptomatic shoulders may uncover subtle subluxations; examination of other peripheral joints may reveal evidence of hyperlaxity and multidirectional instability. With understanding of the nature, direction, and extent of the instability patterns, more appropriate stabilization procedures may diminish the incidence of arthritis of dislocation. Today's techniques and the surgical management of instabilities obviate the need for hardware, which has been shown to have a significant impact on the occurrence of this arthritis. Surgeons should realize the potentials and risks of arthroscopic stabilization procedures, and only after satisfactory analysis should these procedures be done by orthopedic surgeons in general. Many new techniques for shoulder stabilization are now in the armementarium of the arthroscopist, but more time is needed to see if they will influence the development of arthritis of instability. When arthritis of dislocation does develop, shoulder arthroplasty is reasonable, despite the young age of patients. In the technique of joint replacement for this condition, specific surgical principles must be kept in mind. Preservation of deltoid function is paramount. Restoration of muscle length and tension relationships are critical for successful functional outcomes. Component positioning and orientation must account for the bone loss and alterations in soft tissue tension and quality. No shoulder replacement, no matter how well performed, will be successful without adequate physician-directed rehabilitation.",1998,29,3,453-66,10.1016/s0030-5898(05)70021-3,#3234,Brems 1998,
553,11533524.0,Risk factors of atherosclerosis and saphenous vein endothelial function.,Int Angiol,"BACKGROUND: Impaired vasomotor function has been suggested as playing a role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and it may also affect the late patency of bypass grafts. We evaluated, in vitro, the influence of risk factors of atherosclerosis on saphenous vein endothelial function in patients with cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Forty-five saphenous vein rings with intact (E+) and denuded endothelium (E-) were studied. The following drugs were used: norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine (Ach), histamine (H) and serotonine (5-HT). RESULTS: Contraction to norepinephrine (n=15) showed a maximal tension of 783+/-115 percent that was increased in diabetics, smokers, and patients with hypertension. There was a wide range of response to acetylcholine in rings with intact endothelium (n=25), (mean relaxation 16.4+/-1.7 percent, ranging from -22.2 percent to 45 percent) with relaxation (26+/-1.1 percent) and contraction (-11+/-1.2 percent); relaxation was reduced in patients with hypertension and in diabetics (7.4+/-2.6 percent vs non diabetics 24.4+/-1.73 percent; p<0.01). Five of the 12 veins from diabetics exibited contraction (10+/-1.48 percent). Histamine (n=15) caused moderate relaxation at low doses (25+/-2.46 percent) followed by contraction at higher concentrations (184+/-5.7 percent). This was greater in diabetics (193+/-6.8 percent vs non diabetics 157+/-5.3 percent; p=0.045) while in preparations without endothelium (n=10) only relaxation was obtained (45+/-2.89 percent). Contraction (242+/-7.4 percent) was observed in response to serotonine (n=15) that was not affected by endothelial removal. In this study saphenous vein: (1) exhibited a wide range of responses to acetylcholine; (2) evoked marked contraction to norepinephrine and serotonine; (3) elicited contraction in response to histamine that was endothelium-dependent, suggesting the production or the release of an endothelium-derived-contracting-factor (EDCF). CONCLUSIONS: Saphenous vein is able to secrete a contracting factor in patients with risk factors of atherosclerosis and above all diabetes. The mechanisms that regulate the balance between the relaxing and contracting factors and how the endothelial cells become the source of the substances with vasoconstrictor activity remain to be determined.",2001,20,2,152-63,,#3235,Sessa 2001,

We investigated immunohistochemically the localization of the binding sites of the enterotoxin in the preparation under the conditions in which the enterotoxin reduced maximally the amplitudes of the twitch tension elicited by electrical stimulations to the phrenic nerve. Under the conditions, double immunohistochemical staining of the preparation with (1) rabbit anti-enterotoxin IgG-rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and (2) mouse anti-synaptophysin (one of the synaptic vesicle-specific membrane proteins)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG showed that the enterotoxin binds specifically to most of the sites which were stained with anti-synaptophysin exactly in the same configurations having the shapes of the nerve endings in the endplates. The thin section electron micrographs of the enterotoxin-intoxicated preparation showed no alterations in the ultrastructure of the neuromuscular junction and the nerve endings filled with numerous synaptic vesicles. The present results, together with our previous electrophysiological findings, indicate that the enterotoxin binds specifically to the presynaptic nerve endings and inhibits neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction.",1995,33,4,499-506,10.1016/0041-0101(94)00165-5,#3236,Senda 1995,

Early success of the reverse shoulder arthroplasty for reconstructions has recently been reported. The reverse allograft-prosthetic composite offers the advantage of improved glenohumeral stability compared with hemiarthroplasty for proximal humeral reconstructions as it uses the deltoid for stability. METHODS: This article describes the technique for treating proximal humeral tumors, including preoperative planning, biopsy principles, resection pearls, soft tissue tensioning, and specifics about reconstruction using the reverse allograft-prosthetic composite. Two cases are presented along with the functional outcomes with use of this technique. Biomechanical considerations during reconstruction are reviewed, including techniques to improve the deltoid compression force. RESULTS: Reported instability rates are less with reverse shoulder arthroplasty reconstruction as opposed to hemiarthroplasty or total shoulder arthroplasty reconstructions of tumor resections. Reported functional outcomes are promising for the reverse allograft-prosthetic composite reconstructions, although complications are reported. CONCLUSION: Reverse allograft-prosthetic composites are a promising option for proximal humeral reconstructions, although nonunion of the allograft-host bone junction continues to be a challenge for this technique.",2016,25,1,45-54,10.1016/j.jse.2015.06.021,#3237,King 2016,Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty

In order to further understand this process during SSC exercises, the interaction between fascicle-tendinous tissues (TT) of the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle was examined under different prestretch and rebound intensity drop jumps. Ten male subjects participated in the study. Direct VL fascicle lengths (N = 10) and in vivo patellar tendon force (N = 1) were measured together with the electromyographic (EMG) activity of VL during the trials. With increasing drop height but the same rebound height condition, the TT stretch increased during the early braking phase with a subsequent increase in its recoil during the early push-off phase. This occurred concomitantly with decreased fascicle shortening and EMG activation. However, with the increased rebound height but the same drop height condition, the fascicles were stretched less during the late braking phase with higher EMG activation. In this situation, TT could be stretched more by the tension provided by fascicles. Consequently, the TT recoil increased during the late push-off phase. These observations confirm that there can be an intensity specific fascicle-TT interaction during SSC exercises.",2006,16,5,423-31,10.1016/j.jelekin.2005.08.006,#3238,Ishikawa 2006,
557,18054024.0,Strains and stresses in sub-dermal tissues of the buttocks are greater in paraplegics than in healthy during sitting.,J Biomech,"A pressure-related deep tissue injury (DTI) is a severe pressure ulcer, which initiates in muscle tissue overlying a bony prominence (e.g. the ischial tuberosities, IT) and progresses outwards through fat and skin, unnoticed by the paralyzed patient. We recently showed that internal strains and stresses in muscle and fat of individuals at anatomical sites susceptible to DTI can be evaluated by integrating Open-MRI scans with subject-specific finite element (FE) analyzes (Linder-Ganz et al., Journal of Biomechanics, 2007); however, sub-dermal soft tissue strains/stresses from paraplegics are still missing in literature. We hypothesize that the pathoanatomy of the buttocks in paraplegia increases the internal soft tissue loads under the IT, making these patients inherently susceptible to DTI. We hence compared the strain and stress peaks in the gluteus muscle and fat tissues under the IT of six healthy and six paraplegic patients, using the coupled MRI-FE method. Peak principal compression, principal tension, von Mises and shear strains in the gluteus were 1.2-, 3.1-, 1.4- and 1.4-fold higher in paraplegics than in healthy, respectively (p<0.02). Likewise, peak principal compression, principal tension, von Mises and shear stresses in the gluteus were 1.9-, 2.5-, 2.1- and 1.7-fold higher for the paraplegics (p<0.05). Peak gluteal compression and shear stresses decreased by as much as 70% when the paraplegic patients moved from a sitting to a lying posture, indicating on the effectiveness of recommending such patients to lie down after prolonged periods of sitting. This is the first attempt to compare internal soft tissue loads between paraplegic and healthy subjects, using an objective standardized bioengineering method of analysis. The findings support our hypothesis that internal tissue loads are significantly higher in paraplegics, and that postural changes significantly affect these loads. The method of analysis is useful for quantifying the effectiveness of various interventions to alleviate sub-dermal tissue loads at sites susceptible to pressure ulcers and DTI, including cushions, mattresses, recommendations for posture and postural changes, etc.",2008,41,3,567-80,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2007.10.011,#3239,Linder-Ganz 2008,
558,17096248.0,Improved estimation of human neck tensile tolerance: reducing the range of reported tolerance using anthropometrically correct muscles and optimized physiologic initial conditions.,Stapp Car Crash J,"Unlike other modes of loading, the tolerance of the human neck in tension depends heavily on the load bearing capabilities of the muscles of the neck. Because of limitations in animal models, human cadaver, and volunteer studies, computational modeling of the cervical spine is the best way to understand the influence of muscle on whole neck tolerance to tension. Muscle forces are a function of the muscle's geometry, constitutive properties, and state of activation. To generate biofidelic responses for muscle, we obtained accurate three-dimensional muscle geometry for 23 pairs of cervical muscles from a combination of human cadaver dissection and 50(th) percentile male human volunteer magnetic resonance imaging and incorporated those muscles into a computational model of the ligamentous spine that has been previously validated against human cadaver studies. To account for multiple origins, insertions, and lines of action, 82 muscle partition pairs, including nonlinear passive and active elastic components, were included in the model. Using optimization, we determined physiologically appropriate levels of muscle activation for each of the 23 muscles simulating relaxed (no pre-impact awareness) and tensed (pre-impact awareness) states. Unlike all prior neck models, both of these states of activation were mechanically stable in an upright neutral anatomic position resisting gravity as an initial condition prior to tensile loading. Tensile forces were then applied to the models at the head center of gravity at 500 N/s. Both states of activation predicted injury above C3, consistent with clinically observed tensile neck injuries. Using these more physiologically reasonable estimates of muscle activation significantly narrowed the range of estimates of 50(th) percentile male tolerance to tensile loading. Specifically, while the ligamentous spine fails in tension at an average of 1.8 kN and the total muscle activation predicts neck failure at 4.8 kN, the optimized muscle forces resulted in a whole neck tolerance of 3.1 kN and 3.7 kN for the relaxed and tensed neck, respectively. Moreover, these techniques provide quantitative estimates of load sharing between the neck musculature and ligamentous spine that will be useful in the creation of next generation ATD necks.",2003,47,,135-53,10.4271/2003-22-0008,#3240,Chancey 2003,

This study investigated whether the vasodilatory activity involves the endothelium and is specific for certain wines. Effects of different red and white wines and phenolic grape ingredients on vascular tension and cGMP content were studied in human coronary arteries and rat aortic rings in vitro. Only French and Italian red wines produced ""en barrique"" (Bordeaux, Châteauneuf du Pape, Barolo) (1:1,000, vol/vol), quercetin (1-100 microM), and tannic acid (1-100 microgram/ml) decreased tension of precontracted vascular rings and increased vascular cGMP content (both P < 0.001). The effects were abolished after endothelial denudation and reversible by nitric oxide synthase inhibition. Red wines not produced en barrique (Valpolicella, Ahr Spätburgunder), white wines (en barrique-produced Rioja, Chardonnay, Mosel-Riesling), and ethanol did not affect vascular tension or cGMP content. Thus endothelium-dependent vasodilatory effects appear to be specific for red barrique wines, possibly because of their high content of phenolic substances.

560,27779431.0,Acellular dermal matrix: New applications for free flap pedicle coverage - A prospective study in 10 patients.,J Cosmet Laser Ther,"INTRODUCTION: The goal of lower extremity reconstruction after trauma is the coverage of defects to give patients a healed wound and to let them resume their life, ambulate and return to work, while preventing amputation. In this article, we describe an innovative use of Integra® for free flap pedicle coverage in lower extremity reconstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2011 and December 2015, ten patients, four women and six men, underwent a lower limb reconstruction with an association of free flap and Integra® to cover the flap pedicle. The mean age of the patients was 38.8±15.6 years at the time of surgery (range of 14-59 years). The mean defect size was 102±54 cm(2) (range of 40-160 cm(2)). The bone and/or tendons were exposed at the level of the middle third of the leg in 2 cases, at the level of the distal leg in 5 cases and at the level of the foot in 3 cases. RESULTS: There were no intra-operative complications. Mean size of Integra® needed for flap pedicle coverage was 12.8±2.3 cm(2) (range 10-15 cm(2)). The mean follow-up was 41±19 months (range 21-70 months). Revision surgery was necessary in three cases due to haematoma of the pedicle. In these cases, the dermal substitute was easily removed while awaiting revision. This allowed flap survival in all cases. A skin graft was performed after a mean time of 3.4±0.8 weeks post-operatively. Complications at the donor site level included one seroma and a case of hypertrophic scar. Complete healing of both the donor and recipient sites was achieved in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of free flap and Integra® appears to be a useful option in covering complex defects in the lower limb.

561,24790014.0,Age-related structural alterations in human skeletal muscle fibers and mitochondria are sex specific: relationship to single-fiber function.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is implicated in the development of disease and physical disability. However, little is known about how age affects skeletal muscle structure at the cellular and ultrastructural levels or how such alterations impact function. Thus we examined skeletal muscle structure at the tissue, cellular, and myofibrillar levels in young (21-35 yr) and older (65-75 yr) male and female volunteers, matched for habitual physical activity level. Older adults had smaller whole muscle tissue cross-sectional areas (CSAs) and mass. At the cellular level, older adults had reduced CSAs in myosin heavy chain II (MHC II) fibers, with no differences in MHC I fibers. In MHC II fibers, older men tended to have fewer fibers with large CSAs, while older women showed reduced fiber size across the CSA range. Older adults showed a decrease in intermyofibrillar mitochondrial size; however, the age effect was driven primarily by women (i.e., age by sex interaction effect). Mitochondrial size was inversely and directly related to isometric tension and myosin-actin cross-bridge kinetics, respectively. Notably, there were no intermyofibrillar or subsarcolemmal mitochondrial fractional content or myofilament ultrastructural differences in the activity-matched young and older adults. Collectively, our results indicate age-related reductions in whole muscle size do not vary by sex. However, age-related structural alterations at the cellular and subcellular levels are different between the sexes and may contribute to different functional phenotypes in ways that modulate sex-specific reductions in physical capacity with age.",2014,116,12,1582-92,10.1152/japplphysiol.01362.2013,#3243,Callahan 2014,aging
562,17926061.0,Neuromuscular performance and bone structural characteristics in young healthy men and women.,Eur J Appl Physiol,"Muscle mass and strength have been shown to be important factors in bone strength. Low muscular force predisposes to falling especially among elderly. Regular exercise helps to prevent falls and resulting bone fractures. Better understanding of muscle function and its importance on bone properties may thus add information to fracture prevention. Therefore the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between bone strength and muscular force production. Twenty-young men [24 (2) years] and 20 [24 (3) years] women served as subjects. Bone compressive (BSI(d)) and bending strength indices (50 Imax) were measured with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at tibial mid-shaft and at distal tibia. Ankle plantarflexor muscle volume (MV) was estimated from muscle thickness measured with ultrasonography. Neuromuscular performance was evaluated from the measurements of maximal ground reaction force (GRF) in bilateral jumping and of eccentric maximal voluntary ankle plantarflexor torque (MVC). Specific tension (ST) of the plantarflexors was calculated by dividing the MVC with the muscle volume. Activation level (AL) was measured with superimposed twitch method. Distal tibia BSI(d) and tibial mid-shaft 50 Imax correlated positively with GRF, MVC and MV in men (r = 0.45-0.67, P < 0.05). Tibial mid-shaft 50 Imax and neuromuscular performance variables were correlated in women (r = 0.46-0.59, P < 0.05), whereas no correlation was seen in distal tibia. In the regression analysis, MV and ST could explain 64% of the variance in tibial mid-shaft bone strength and 41% of the variation in distal tibia bone strength. The study emphasizes that tibial strength is related to maximal neuromuscular performance. In addition, tibial mid-shaft seems to be more dependent on the neuromuscular performance, than distal tibia. In young adults, the association between bone adaptation and neuromuscular performance seems to be moderate and also site and loading specific.",2008,102,2,215-22,10.1007/s00421-007-0575-8,#3244,Rantalainen 2008,
563,11437537.0,Localization of regions of troponin I important in deactivation of cardiac myofilaments by acidic pH.,J Mol Cell Cardiol,"Ca2+-activation of cardiac muscle myofilaments is more sensitive to depression by acidic pH than is the case with skeletal myofilaments. We tested the hypothesis that this difference is related to specific regions of the TnI (troponin I) isoforms in these muscles. We exchanged native Tn complex in detergent-extracted fiber bundles from mouse ventricles with Tn containing various combinations of fast (fsTnI) or slow skeletal (ssTnI) complexed with either cardiac TnC (cTnC) or fsTnC, and with cTnC complexed with the following chimeras: (1) fsTnI N-terminal region (fN) plus cTnI inhibitory peptide (cIp) and cTnI C-terminal region (cC); and (2) cTnI N-terminal region (cN)-cIp-fsTnI C-terminal region (fC). We determined the change in half maximal Ca2+(DeltaEC50) for tension activation at pH 7.0 and pH 6.5. Similar DeltaEC50 values were obtained for unextracted controls (5.53+/-0.30 microm), for preparations containing cTnI-cTnC (5.74+/-0.40 microm), and preparations exchanged with cTnI-fsTnC (5.63+/-0.40 microm). However, replacement of cTnI with fsTnI significantly decreased DeltaEC50 to 3.95+/-0.17 microm. Replacement of cTnI with ssTnI also significantly depressed DeltaEC50 to 2.07+/-0.15 microm. Results of studies using the chimeras demonstrated that the C-terminal domains of cTnI and fsTnI are responsible for these differences. This conclusion also fits with data from experiments in which we measured Ca2+-binding to the regulatory site of cTnC in binary complexes containing cTnC with cTnI, fsTnI, or the chimeras. Our results localize a region of TnI important in effects of acidosis on cardiac myofilaments and extend our earlier data indicating that C-terminal regions of cTnI outside the Ip are critical for activation by Ca2+.",2001,33,7,1309-20,10.1006/jmcc.2000.1392,#3245,Li 2001,

We describe here a scalable tissue-cultivation platform that is cell source agnostic and enables drug testing under electrical pacing. The plastic platform enabled on-line noninvasive recording of passive tension, active force, contractile dynamics, and Ca(2+) transients, as well as endpoint assessments of action potentials and conduction velocity. By combining directed cell differentiation with electrical field conditioning, we engineered electrophysiologically distinct atrial and ventricular tissues with chamber-specific drug responses and gene expression. We report, for the first time, engineering of heteropolar cardiac tissues containing distinct atrial and ventricular ends, and we demonstrate their spatially confined responses to serotonin and ranolazine.

565,12004014.0,Ankle and knee coupling in patients with spastic diplegia: effects of gastrocnemius-soleus lengthening.,J Bone Joint Surg Am,"BACKGROUND: Empirical observations of subjects with an equinus gait have suggested that there is coupled motion between the ankle and knee such that, during single-limb stance, the ankle moves into equinus as the knee extends. Since the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle-tendon unit spans both joints, we hypothesized that this muscle-tendon unit may be responsible for the coupling and that lengthening of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle alone would result in greater ankle dorsiflexion as well as greater knee extension in single-limb stance, effectively uncoupling these joints. The concept that gastrocnemius-soleus lengthening may promote knee extension is counter to the popular notion that crouch gait may result if the hamstrings are not lengthened concomitantly. METHODS: A retrospective review identified thirty-four subjects with specific kinematic characteristics of equinus gait, and their gait was compared with that of normal children. Of the thirty-four subjects, eleven (twenty-two limbs) subsequently underwent isolated midcalf lengthening of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles with use of a recession technique. Gait analysis including joint kinematics and joint kinetics, electromyography, and physical examination were performed to test the hypothesis. RESULTS: We found that, unlike the normal subjects, the patients with an equinus gait pattern had a positive correlation (r = 0.7) between ankle and knee motion during single-limb stance. As hypothesized, ankle plantar flexion occurred while the knee moved into extension during single-limb stance. Calculations of the lengths of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle-tendon units showed them to be short throughout the gait cycle (p < 0.0001). After gastrocnemius-soleus recession, peak ankle dorsiflexion (p < 0.001) and peak ankle power (p < 0.001) shifted to occur later in stance than they did in the preoperative gait cycle. Furthermore, the magnitude of peak power increased (p < 0.001) in late stance despite the added length of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle-tendon unit. The electromyographic amplitude of the gastrocnemius-soleus was reduced during loading (p < 0.02), and this finding, together with the kinetic changes, suggested that muscle tension was reduced. Changes at the knee were less pronounced but included greater knee extension at foot contact (p < 0.01). No increase in the knee flexion angle or extension moment occurred in midstance after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with an equinus gait pattern function with a shortened gastrocnemius-soleus muscle-tendon unit, and this results in coupled motion between the ankle and knee during single-limb stance. Lengthening, with use of a recession technique, shifted ankle power generation and dorsiflexion to a later time in stance with no tendency to increase midstance knee flexion. Knee extension did increase at foot contact, but excessive midstance knee flexion persisted and was likely due to concomitant contracture of the hamstrings.",2002,84,5,736-44,10.2106/00004623-200205000-00006,#3247,Baddar 2002,
566,20462139.0,Effects of cigarette smoking on tissue gas exchange during hyperbaric exposures.,Undersea Hyperb Med,"OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigate whether differences exist in human skeletal muscle (MM) and subcutaneous (SC) tissue gas tensions between chronic cigarette smokers and non-smokers measured under room air and hyperbaric conditions. METHODS: Gas tensions in resting MM and SC tissues were recorded using a mass spectrometer at four-minute intervals during two and one-half to three-hour period in smokers and non-smokers during normobaric, normoxic (room air) and hyperbaric conditions. Two hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) protocols were utilized: Protocol A employed the continuous breathing of oxygen (O2) at 2 ATA, a typical monoplace hyperbaric chamber treatment, while Protocol B utilized intermittent air breaks between O2 breathing periods at 2 ATA representative of a multiplace hyperbaric chamber treatment. RESULTS: All tissue gas tensions changed significantly (repeated measures of variance, p=0.00001) with time as pressures and gas mixtures breathed were altered. Significant Individual Step Analysis (ISA) differences occurred with unloading of nitrogen (N2) from the muscle compartment in both protocols (T-test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum). The interaction of grouping variable and time revealed significant differences between smokers and non-smokers in unloading MM N2 in both protocols: Protocol A (p=0.02) and in Protocol B (p=0.022). Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in both protocols decreased significantly with time when exposed to HBO2 while increasing when breathing air at 2 ATA. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates: 1) Smokers release MM N2 more slowly than nonsmokers during hyperbaric oxygen exposures regardless of the treatment protocol used; 2) There were no significant differences in O2 loading of MM and SC tissues during HBO2 exposures between smokers and nonsmokers; 3) The CO2 levels in both protocols decrease with time when exposed to HBO2 while increasing with breathing air at 2 ATA; 4) The known vasoconstriction effect in subcutaneous tissue from nicotine lasts less than one hour with the topical adiabatic heating increasing the O2 loading specifically in the SC tissues of smokers; 5) Wounds heal more slowly due to the chronically injured endothelium from carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, and other toxic products in smoke rather than from the transient elevations of nicotine.",2010,37,2,73-87,,#3249,Hart 2010,
567,17367527.0,"THG113.31, a specific PGF2alpha receptor antagonist, induces human myometrial relaxation and BKCa channel activation.",Reprod Biol Endocrinol,"BACKGROUND: PGF2alpha exerts a significant contractile effect on myometrium and is central to human labour. THG113.31, a specific non-competitive PGF2alpha receptor (FP) antagonist, exerts an inhibitory effect on myometrial contractility. The BKCa channel is ubiquitously encountered in human uterine tissue and plays a significant role in modulating myometrial cell membrane potential and excitability. The objective of this study was to investigate potential BKCa channel involvement in the response of human myometrium to THG113.31. METHODS: Single and whole-cell electrophysiological BKCa channel recordings from freshly dispersed myocytes, were investigated in the presence and absence of THG113.31. Functional studies investigated the effects of THG113.31 on isolated spontaneous myometrial contractions, in the presence and absence of the BKCa channel blocker, iberiotoxin. RESULTS: Single channel recordings identified the BKCa channel as a target of THG113.31. THG113.31 significantly increased the open state probability of these channels [control 0.023+/-0.006; 10 microM THG113.31 0.087+/-0.012 (P = 0.009); and 50 microM THG113.31 0.1356+/-0.018 (P = 0.001)]. In addition, THG113.31 increased whole-cell BKCa currents over a range of membrane potentials, and this effect was reversed by 100 nanoM IbTX. Isometric tension studies demonstrated that THG113.31 exerted a significant concentration-dependent relaxant effect on human myometrial tissue and pre-incubation of strips with IbTX abolished this effect on spontaneously occurring contractions. CONCLUSION: These data suggests that activation of the BKCa channel may contribute, at least partially, to the uterorelaxant effect of THG113.31.",2007,5,,10,10.1186/1477-7827-5-10,#3250,Doheny 2007,
568,29226977.0,Mechanical responses of the mechanosensitive unstructured domains in cardiac titin.,Biol Cell,"BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Titin is one of the three main filaments in cardiac sarcomere. Besides a chain of Ig domains, cardiac titin also contains a proline (P), glutamate (E), valine (V), lysine (K) (PEVK) domain and a cardiac-specific N2B domain, both are largely unstructured. While they are believed to be involved in the elastic (PEVK and N2B) and the trophic (N2B) functions of the heart, their mechanical responses in physiological level of forces remains poorly understood. RESULTS: In order to gain understanding on their mechanical responses, we used magnetic tweezers to investigate their force responses from 1 to 30 pN. We confirmed that in vitro the PEVK domain is intrinsically disordered within the force range. Surprisingly, we discovered a mechanosensitive folded element in the disordered region of N2B, ∼84 amino acids in length, which has a large folding energy of approximately -10 k(B) T. Based on the force responses of PEVK and N2B domains, as well as an approximated force-dependent unfolding and refolding rates of titin Ig domains, we show that the tension in cardiac titin fluctuates within 5 pN during cardiac contraction and extension cycle using Gillespie simulation algorithm. Exceptionally, the simulation shows that deletion of N2B domain results in 10-fold increase in peak force. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight a critical role that N2B may potentially play in regulating tension on cardiac titin. SIGNIFICANCE: The study provides new insights into the tension regulatory role of unstructured domains in the elastic function of the heart, which has broad implication in diastolic dysfunction and cardiac trophic mechanisms. In addition, the method can be applied to probing other unstructured mechanosensitive proteins/domains.",2018,110,3,65-76,10.1111/boc.201700061,#3251,Pang 2018,Cardiac titin
569,19213591.0,Cervical musculoskeletal impairment is common in elders with headache.,Man Ther,"There is an opinion that with increasing cervical degenerative joint disease with ageing, cervicogenic headaches become more frequent. This study aimed to determine if cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction was specific to headache classifiable as cervicogenic or was more generic to headache in elders. Subjects (n=118), aged 60-75 years with recurrent headache and 44 controls were recruited. Neck function measures included range of motion (ROM), cervical joint dysfunction, cranio-cervical flexor muscle function, joint position sense (JPS) and cervical muscle strength. A questionnaire documented the characteristics of headaches for classification. A cluster analysis based on three musculoskeletal variables aligned previously with cervicogenic headache, divided headache subjects into two groups; cluster 1 (n=57), cluster 2 (n=50). Dysfunctions were greater in cluster 1 than in 2 for extension range and C1-2 joint dysfunction (p<0.05). Most cervicogenic headaches were grouped in cluster 1, but musculoskeletal dysfunction was also found in headaches classifiable as migraine or tension-type headache. Neck dysfunction is not uniquely confined to cervicogenic headache in elders.

In obstructive HCM patients who underwent surgical myectomy (SM), we sought to determine if there is a significant association between echocardiographic longitudinal strain, histopathology, and in vitro myocardial performance (resting tension and developed tension) of the surgical specimen. METHODS AND RESULTS: HCM patients (n=122, 54±14 years, 54% men) undergoing SM were prospectively recruited. Longitudinal systolic strain and diastolic strain rates were measured at that basal septum (partially removed at SM) by using velocity vector imaging on preoperative echocardiography. Semiquantitative histopathologic grading of myocyte disarray and fibrosis and in vitro measurements of resting tension and developed tension were made in septal tissue obtained at SM. Mean basal septal systolic strain and diastolic strain rate were -8.3±5% and 0.62±0.4/s, while mild or greater degree of myocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis were present in 85% and 87%, respectively. Mean resting tension and developed tension were 2.8±1 and 1.4±0.8 g/mm(2). On regression analysis, basal septal systolic strain, diastolic strain rate, disarray, and fibrosis were associated with developed tension (β=0.19, 0.20, -0.33, and -0.40, respectively, all P<0.01) and resting tension (β=0.21, 0.22, -0.25, and -0.28, respectively, all P<0.01). CONCLUSION: In obstructive HCM patients who underwent SM, left ventricular mechanics (echocardiographic longitudinal systolic strain and diastolic strain rates), assessed at the basal septum (myocardium removed during myectomy) and histopathologic findings characteristic for HCM (disarray and fibrosis) were significantly associated with in vitro myocardial resting and developed contractile performance.",2014,3,6,e001269,10.1161/JAHA.114.001269,#3253,Dhillon 2014,HCM
571,11104785.0,Stretch-induced alternative splicing of serum response factor promotes bronchial myogenesis and is defective in lung hypoplasia.,J Clin Invest,"Smooth muscle (SM) develops only in organs and sites that sustain mechanical tensions. Therefore, we determined the role of stretch in mouse and human bronchial myogenesis. Sustained stretch induced expression of SM proteins in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells and accelerated the differentiation of cells undergoing myogenesis. Moreover, bronchial myogenesis was entirely controlled in lung organ cultures by the airway intraluminal pressure. Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor critical for the induction of muscle-specific gene expression. Recently, a SRF-truncated isoform produced by alternative splicing of exon 5 has been identified (SRFDelta5). Here we show that undifferentiated mesenchymal cells synthesize both SRF and SRFDelta5 but that SRFDelta5 synthesis is suppressed during bronchial myogenesis in favor of increased SRF production. Stretch induces the same change in SRF alternative splicing, and its myogenic effect is abrogated by overexpressing SRFDelta5. Furthermore, human hypoplastic lungs related to conditions that hinder cell stretching continue to synthesize SRFDelta5 and show a marked decrease in bronchial and interstitial SM cells and their ECM product, tropoelastin. Taken together, our findings indicate that stretch plays a critical role in SM myogenesis and suggest that its decrease precludes normal bronchial muscle development.",2000,106,11,1321-30,10.1172/JCI8893,#3254,Yang 2000,
572,17895552.0,Prognostic value of arterial/alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2) in acute pulmonary embolism.,Circ J,"BACKGROUND: Because the arterial/alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2) is relatively constant throughout the entire range of fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2), its use in determining the prognosis of acute pulmonary embolism (APE) was investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study retrospectively assessed 202 consecutive patients with APE confirmed by computed tomography or high probability lung scintigraphy. All patients underwent initial arterial blood gas analysis during the first 24 h of admission. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine the a/APO2 cut-off value for predicting 30-day death or 30-day composite events. Cut-off values for a/APO2 were used to determine stability in all patients and 2 subgroups (0.49 for all patients; 0.49 for FiO2 =0.21; 0.46 for FiO2 >0.21). Using the cut-off value of a/APO2 <0.49 for predicting 30-day death, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 90%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 30.3%. For the 30-day composite end point, the NPV was 81.3%, and the PPV was 40.9%. Excluding massive APE, the a/APO2 also had high NPV and moderate PPV in predicting short-term prognosis. This study additionally demonstrated a linear relationship between platelet count and a/APO2. CONCLUSIONS: The cut-off value of a/APO2 <0.49 exhibits stability at variable FiO2 values and is a useful prognostic predictor in APE.",2007,71,10,1560-6,10.1253/circj.71.1560,#3255,Hsu 2007,
573,10586950.0,The effects of protein kinase C on trabecular meshwork and ciliary muscle contractility.,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,"PURPOSE: The possible role of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors in novel pressure-lowering drugs is currently under investigation. To gain further insight into regulation of contractility by PKC in trabecular meshwork (TM) and ciliary muscle (CM), the effects of various PKC inhibitors and activators were tested. METHODS: Isometric tension measurements of bovine TM and CM strips were performed. PKC was stimulated by phorbol ester and by the diacylglycerol analogue diC8. PKC blockade was accomplished using H7 and myristoilated PKC substrate (mPKC). Western blot analysis was used to identify specific PKC isoforms in human trabecular meshwork (HTM), human ciliary muscle (HCM), and bovine TM and CM. RESULTS: In tissues precontracted by carbachol PKC antagonist H7 led to a relaxation of TM (25+/-7.2 versus 100%; n = 8) with no effect on CM. mPKC substrate selectively blocks PKC. This substance led to relaxation of TM (32.8+/-7.4 versus 100%, n = 7), whereas CM was not affected. PMA at concentrations of 10(-6) M led to a slow contraction of both tissues that was more marked in TM. DiC8 and 4alpha-phorbol had no effect on contractility. Western blot analysis revealed expression of calcium-dependent PKC-alpha and calcium-independent PKC-epsilon isoforms in HTM and HCM. PKC-epsilon expression was more pronounced in HTM than in HCM. Similar PKC isoform expression was found in native bovine tissue. CONCLUSIONS: PKC isoforms show different tissue distributions in human and bovine TM and CM. Contractility differences exist in both tissues in response to PKC antagonists and agonists. The data indicate that PKC may be involved in regulation of aqueous humor outflow by the TM. Thus, inhibition of PKC may represent a new way of influencing outflow facility through isolated relaxation of TM.",1999,40,13,3254-61,,#3256,Thieme 1999,
574,20584115.0,Endogenous vasoactive peptides and the human vagina--a molecular biology and functional study.,J Sex Med,"INTRODUCTION: Endogenous peptides, such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), and bradykinin (BK), have been proposed to play a role in the female sexual arousal response by exerting relaxation of clitoral, labial, and vaginal smooth muscle. While the effects of endogenous peptides on the human male erectile tissue have already been described, only very few studies have been conducted to investigate the peptidergic control of female genital tissues, including the vagina. AIMS: To elucidate the expression of mRNA specifically encoding for peptide receptors in the human vagina and the effects of VIP, CNP, and BK on the tension induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1) of isolated human vaginal wall smooth muscle. The production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in response to exposure of the tissue to the peptides was also measured. METHODS: The expression of mRNA encoding for receptor proteins specific for VIP, CNP, and BK were investigated by means of molecular biology (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] analysis). Using the organ bath technique, the effects of VIP, CNP, and BK (0.1 nM to 1 µM) on the tension induced by 0.1 µM ET-1 of human vaginal strips were investigated. The tissue was also exposed to three different concentrations of VIP, CNP, and BK (0.01 µM, 0.1 µM, 1 µM) and the production of cAMP and cGMP determined by means of radioimmunoassays. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Characterize the expression of peptide receptors in the human vagina and measure the relaxation exerted by BK, CNP, and VIP on the contraction induced by ET-1 of isolated human vaginal tissue. In addition, the effects of the peptides on the production of cAMP and cGMP were also elucidated. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of mRNA transcripts encoding for the VIP receptors VIP1R/vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor type 1 (VPAC1) and VIP2R/VPAC2, CNP receptors natriuretic peptide receptor type A (NPRA), natriuretic peptide receptor type B (NPRB) and natriuretic peptide receptor type C (NPRC), and BK receptor B2R. The tension induced by ET-1 was reversed by the peptides with the following rank order of efficacy: BK (21.7%) > VIP (20.9%) > CNP (13.3%). The relaxing effects of VIP and BK were paralleled by a 4.8-fold and fivefold increase in cAMP, while the production of cGMP was stimulated 38-fold and 119-fold in the presence of CNP or BK, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results are in support of the hypothesis that endogenous peptides may contribute to the control of human vaginal smooth muscle tone through the involvement of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways.",2011,8,1,35-43,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01923.x,#3257,Rahardjo 2011,
575,17409372.0,Modulation of human arterial tone during pregnancy: the effect of the bioactive metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate.,Biol Reprod,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a potent bioactive lipid that has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. The objective of the present study was to determine the vasoactive effects and underlying mechanisms of S1P on adult human maternal arteries. The isometric tensions of the omental and myometrial arteries isolated from normal pregnant women at term were assessed in response to incremental doses of S1P in the presence or absence of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The putative involvement of Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs) in intact arteries and in those permeabilized with alpha-toxin, to study agonist-dependent calcium-sensitization, was assessed with the inhibitor Y27632. Real-time RT-PCR established the presence of mRNA encoding the S1P receptors (S1P(1) to (3)), previously known as endothelial differentiation gene receptors (EDG1, 3 and 5), in both artery types. S1P induced a dose-dependent increase in the isometric tension of all the arteries. Y27632 reduced constriction due to S1P in intact arteries and reduced S1P-induced sensitization of contraction to submaximal activating Ca(2+) in permeabilized arteries. L-NAME also modulated S1P vasoactive responses in a tissue-specific manner. Two subgroups of omental arteries were identified, one of which utilizes the NO pathway. In myometrial arteries, S1P evoked oscillatory constrictions, whereas pretreatment with L-NAME resulted in only tonic constrictions of unaltered peak magnitude. The prominent vasoactive actions of S1P in the maternal arteries of pregnant women are modulated by inhibitors of ROCKs and NO bioavailability. The subtle tissue-specific functional differences in the modulation of S1P actions by NO have important implications for vascular tone regulation by this bioactive circulatory metabolite during pregnancy.",2007,77,1,45-52,10.1095/biolreprod.107.060681,#3258,Hudson 2007,
576,32885903.0,Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase increases myofibril viscosity in cardiac myocytes.,Cytoskeleton (Hoboken),"The coordinated generation of mechanical forces by cardiac myocytes is required for proper heart function. Myofibrils are the functional contractile units of force production within individual cardiac myocytes. At the molecular level, myosin motors form cross-bridges with actin filaments and use ATP to convert chemical energy into mechanical forces. The energetic efficiency of the cross-bridge cycle is influenced by the viscous damping of myofibril contraction. The viscoelastic response of myofibrils is an emergent property of their individual mechanical components. Previous studies have implicated titin-actin interactions, cell-ECM adhesion, and microtubules as regulators of the viscoelastic response of myofibrils. Here we probed the viscoelastic response of myofibrils using laser-assisted dissection. As a proof-of-concept, we found actomyosin contractility was required to endow myofibrils with their viscoelastic response, with blebbistatin treatment resulting in decreased myofibril tension and viscous damping. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key regulator of cell-ECM adhesion, microtubule stability, and myofibril assembly. We found inhibition of FAK signaling altered the viscoelastic properties of myofibrils. Specifically, inhibition of FAK resulted in increased viscous damping of myofibril retraction following laser ablation. This damping was not associated with acute changes in the electrophysiological properties of cardiac myocytes. These results implicate FAK as a regulator of mechanical properties of myofibrils.",2020,77,9,342-350,10.1002/cm.21632,#3259,Taneja 2020,cardiac myocyte
577,16682230.0,Mechanical properties of cardiac titin's N2B-region by single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy.,J Struct Biol,"Titin is a giant protein responsible for passive-tension generation in muscle sarcomeres. Here, we used single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy to investigate the mechanical characteristics of a recombinant construct from the human cardiac-specific N2B-region, which harbors a 572-residue unique sequence flanked by two immunoglobulin (Ig) domains on either side. Force-extension curves of the N2B-construct revealed mean unfolding forces for the Ig-domains similar to those of a recombinant fragment from the distal Ig-region in titin (I91-98). The mean contour length of the N2B-unique sequence was 120 nm, but there was a bimodal distribution centered at approximately 95 nm (major peak) and 180 nm (minor peak). These values are lower than expected if the N2B-unique sequence were a permanently unfolded entropic spring, but are consistent with the approximately 100 nm maximum extension of that segment measured in isolated stretched cardiomyofibrils. A contour-length below 200 nm would be reasonable, however, if the N2B-unique sequence were stabilized by a disulphide bridge, as suggested by several disulphide connectivity prediction algorithms. Since the N2B-unique sequence can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), which lowers titin-based stiffness, we studied whether addition of PKA (+ATP) affects the mechanical properties of the N2B-construct, but found no changes. The softening effect of PKA on N2B-titin may require specific conditions/factors present inside the cardiomyocytes.",2006,155,2,263-72,10.1016/j.jsb.2006.02.017,#3260,Leake 2006,
578,21878406.0,A preliminary model of gastrointestinal electromechanical coupling.,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,"Gastrointestinal (GI) motility is coordinated by several cooperating mechanisms, including electrical slow wave activity, the enteric nervous system (ENS), and other factors. Slow waves generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) depolarize smooth muscle cells (SMC), generating basic GI contractions. This unique electrical coupling presents an added layer of complexity to GI electromechanical models, and a current barrier to further progress is the lack of a framework for ICC-SMC-contraction coupling. In this study, an initial framework for the electromechanical coupling was developed in a 2-D model. At each solution step, the slow wave propagation was solved first and [Ca(2+)](i) in the SMC model was related to a Ca(2+)-tension-extension relationship to simulate active contraction. With identification of more GI-specific constitutive laws and material parameters, the ICC-SMC-contraction approach may underpin future GI electromechanical models of health and disease states.",2011,58,12,3491-5,10.1109/TBME.2011.2166155,#3261,Du 2011,
579,16102671.0,Common practices of voice therapists in the evaluation of patients.,J Voice,"This study surveys voice therapists regarding common diagnostic practices in patients referred for therapy with the diagnosis of muscle tension dysphonia (broadly defined as the ""hyperfunctional"" component of the dysphonia). Through postings on the e-mail list of the ASHA special interest division on voice, speech pathologists with at least 3 years' experience in stroboscopy and acoustic instrumentation were invited to complete the survey. Results from 53 completed surveys demonstrated that voice quality and patient self-perception are the sole assessments performed by all therapists. Voice quality, observation of body posture and movement, and probing the patient's ability to alter voice production are each significantly more likely to be performed than the more objective stroboscopic, acoustic, aerodynamic, and EGG assessments. Further, the tasks of defining specific therapy session goals and helping the patient to achieve a particular target skill are considered best served by measures of vocal quality, observation of body position and movement, and judging the patient's ability to alter voice production. For definition of the overall therapy goal, stroboscopy and patient perception scales are added to all of the subjective assessment measures as being important. Acoustic data are considered most important for patient reinforcement and outcomes assessment. Implications of these findings are discussed, and topics for further exploration are identified.",2005,19,3,454-69,10.1016/j.jvoice.2004.08.004,#3262,Behrman 2005,
580,32267561.0,Nutraceutical and pharmaceutical cocktails did not preserve diaphragm muscle function or reduce muscle damage in D2-mdx mice.,Exp Physiol,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? We previously demonstrated that quercetin transiently preserved respiratory function in dystrophin-deficient mice. To gain lasting therapeutic benefits, we tested quercetin in combination with nicotinamide riboside, lisinopril and prednisolone in the D2-mdx model. What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrated that these quercetin-based cocktails did not preserve respiratory or diaphragmatic function or reduce histological damage after 7 months of treatment starting at 4 months of age. ABSTRACT: Duchenne muscular dystrophy is characterized by the absence of dystrophin protein and causes muscle weakness and muscle injury, culminating in respiratory failure and cardiomyopathy. Quercetin transiently improved respiratory function but failed to maintain long-term therapeutic benefits in mdx mice. In this study, we combined quercetin with nicotinamide riboside (NR), lisinopril and prednisolone to assess the efficacy of quercetin-based cocktails. We hypothesized that quercetin, NR and lisinopril independently would improve respiratory function and decrease diaphragmatic injury and when combined would have additive effects. To address this hypothesis, in vivo respiratory function, in vitro diaphragmatic function and histological injury were assessed in DBA (healthy), D2-mdx (dystrophic) and D2-mdx mice treated with combinations of quercetin, NR and lisinopril from 4 to 11 months of age. Respiratory function, assessed using whole-body plethysmography, was largely similar between healthy and dystrophin-deficient mice. Diaphragm specific tension was decreased by ∼50% in dystrophic mice compared with healthy mice (P < 0.05), but fatigue resistance was similar between groups. Contractile area was decreased by ∼10% (P < 0.05) and fibrotic area increased from 3.5% in healthy diaphragms to 27% (P < 0.05) in dystrophic diaphragms. Contrary to expectations, these functional and histological parameters of disease were not offset by any intervention. These data suggest that quercetin, NR and lisinopril, independently and in combination, did not prevent diaphragmatic injury or preserve respiratory function.",2020,105,6,989-999,10.1113/EP087887,#3263,Spaulding 2020,ACE inhibitor
581,28959158.0,Effects of a pre-workout supplement on hyperemia following leg extension resistance exercise to failure with different resistance loads.,J Int Soc Sports Nutr,"BACKGROUND: We sought to determine if a pre-workout supplement (PWS), containing multiple ingredients thought to enhance blood flow, increases hyperemia associated with resistance training compared to placebo (PBO). Given the potential interaction with training loads/time-under-tension, we evaluated the hyperemic response at two different loads to failure. METHODS: Thirty males participated in this double-blinded study. At visit 1, participants were randomly assigned to consume PWS (Reckless™) or PBO (maltodextrin and glycine) and performed four sets of leg extensions to failure at 30% or 80% of their 1-RM 45-min thereafter. 1-wk. later (visit 2), participants consumed the same supplement as before, but exercised at the alternate load. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), femoral artery blood flow, and plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) were assessed at baseline (BL), 45-min post-PWS/PBO consumption (PRE), and 5-min following the last set of leg extensions (POST). Vastus lateralis near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was employed during leg extension exercise. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed with time, supplement, and load as independent variables and Bonferroni correction applied for multiple post-hoc comparisons. Data are reported as mean ± SD. RESULTS: With the 30% training load compared to 80%, significantly more repetitions were performed (p < 0.05), but there was no difference in total volume load (p > 0.05). NIRS derived minimum oxygenated hemoglobin (O(2)Hb) was lower in the 80% load condition compared to 30% for all rest intervals between sets of exercise (p < 0.0167). HR and BP did not vary as a function of supplement or load. Femoral artery blood flow at POST was higher independent of exercise load and treatment. However, a time*supplement*load interaction was observed revealing greater femoral artery blood flow with PWS compared to PBO at POST in the 80% (+56.8%; p = 0.006) but not 30% load condition (+12.7%; p = 0.476). Plasma NOx was ~3-fold higher with PWS compared to PBO at PRE and POST (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to PBO, the PWS consumed herein augmented hyperemia following multiple sets to failure at 80% of 1-RM, but not 30%. This specificity may be a product of interaction with local perturbations (e.g., reduced tissue oxygenation levels [minimum O(2)Hb] in the 80% load condition) and/or muscle fiber recruitment.",2017,14,,38,10.1186/s12970-017-0195-6,#3264,Martin 2017,Blood flow
582,20811500.0,Expression of stretch-activated two-pore potassium channels in human myometrium in pregnancy and labor.,PLoS One,"BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that the stretch-activated, four-transmembrane domain, two pore potassium channels (K2P), TREK-1 and TRAAK are gestationally-regulated in human myometrium and contribute to uterine relaxation during pregnancy until labor. METHODOLOGY: We determined the gene and protein expression of K2P channels in non-pregnant, pregnant term and preterm laboring myometrium. We employed both molecular biological and functional studies of K2P channels in myometrial samples taken from women undergoing cesarean delivery of a fetus. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: TREK-1, but not TREK-2, channels are expressed in human myometrium and significantly up-regulated during pregnancy. Down-regulation of TREK-1 message was seen by Q-PCR in laboring tissues consistent with a role for TREK-1 in maintaining uterine quiescence prior to labor. The TRAAK channel was unregulated in the same women. Blockade of stretch-activated channels with a channel non-specific tarantula toxin (GsMTx-4) or the more specific TREK-1 antagonist L-methionine ethyl ester altered contractile frequency in a dose-dependent manner in pregnant myometrium. Arachidonic acid treatment lowered contractile tension an effect blocked by fluphenazine. Functional studies are consistent with a role for TREK-1 in uterine quiescence. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence supporting a role for TREK-1 in contributing to uterine quiescence during gestation and hypothesize that dysregulation of this mechanism may underlie certain cases of spontaneous pre-term birth.",2010,5,8,e12372,10.1371/journal.pone.0012372,#3265,Buxton 2010,
583,18194185.0,Role of chloride channels in the regulation of corpus cavernosum tone: a potential therapeutic target for erectile dysfunction.,J Sex Med,"INTRODUCTION: Recent electrophysiological recordings have identified the existence of outward, excitatory chloride (Cl(-)) currents in rat, rabbit, and human corpus cavernosum (CC) muscle cells. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological role of Cl(-) currents in the maintenance of cavernosal muscle tone in isolated rabbit CC tissues. METHODS: CC strips (1 x 1 x 5 mm) were suspended in tissue bath chambers for isometric tension experiments. Spontaneous cavernosal tone and contractions elicited by field stimulation or administration of established smooth muscle constrictors were examined in the presence of chloride channel (ClC) blockers, niflumic acid (NFA), and anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (A9C). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Both spontaneous myogenic activity and contractile responses to field stimulation, norepinephrine, histamine, and endothelin-1 were reduced by ClC blockers. Results. In CC strips exhibiting intrinsic myogenic tone, NFA (30 and 100 microM) and A9C (1 mM) caused a relaxation of the tone. In addition, spontaneous contractile activity in CC was abolished in the presence of either ClC blocker. In CC strips precontracted with norepinephrine, histamine, and endothelin-1, both ClC blockers significantly reversed the tone. The ability of NFA and A9C to reverse norepinephrine-induced tone was unaffected by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, and cis-N-[2-phenylcyclopentyl]-azacyclotridec-1-en-2-amine. In addition, neither indomethacin nor tetraethylammonium affected the relaxant response of NFA. NFA and A9C inhibited the neurogenic and norepinephrine-induced contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. While NFA exerted persistent inhibition on neurogenic contraction, inhibition of neurogenic contractions by A9C was readily reversible. On K(+)-depolarized CC, NFA induced a concentration-related relaxation, whereas A9C was inert, suggesting an additional mechanism of NFA on voltage-gated calcium channels. CONCLUSIONS: These results underline the importance of Cl(-) currents as a mechanism in the maintenance of cavernosal tone produced by adrenergic and various endogenous constrictors. Thus, the modulation of Cl(-) current, as an attractive and effective approach to regulate penile erection, and specific ClC blockers, as potential erectogenic agents, merits further research.",2008,5,4,813-821,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00728.x,#3266,Chu 2008,
584,30642915.0,Deletion of Enigma Homologue from the Z-disc slows tension development kinetics in mouse myocardium.,J Gen Physiol,"Enigma Homologue (ENH) is a component of the Z-disc, a structure that anchors actin filaments in the contractile unit of muscle, the sarcomere. Cardiac-specific ablation of ENH protein expression causes contractile dysfunction that ultimately culminates in dilated cardiomyopathy. However, whether ENH is involved in the regulation of myocardial contractility is unknown. To determine if ENH is required for the mechanical activity of cardiac muscle, we analyze muscle mechanics of isolated trabeculae from the hearts of ENH (+/+) and ENH (-/-) mice. We detected no differences in steady-state mechanical properties but show that when muscle fibers are allowed to relax and then are restretched, the rate at which tension redevelops is depressed in ENH (-/-) mouse myocardium relative to that in ENH (+/+) myocardium. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the expression of β-myosin heavy chain is increased in ENH (-/-) mouse myocardium, which could partially, but not completely, account for the depression in tension redevelopment kinetics. Using top-down proteomics analysis, we found that the expression of other thin/thick filament regulatory proteins is unaltered, although the phosphorylation of a cardiac troponin T isoform, cardiac troponin I, and myosin regulatory light chain is decreased in ENH (-/-) mouse myocardium. Nevertheless, these alterations are very small and thus insufficient to explain slowed tension redevelopment kinetics in ENH (-/-) mouse myocardium. These data suggest that the ENH protein influences tension redevelopment kinetics in mouse myocardium, possibly by affecting cross-bridge cycling kinetics. Previous studies also indicate that ablation of specific Z-disc proteins in myocardium slows contraction kinetics, which could also be a contributing factor in this study.",2019,151,5,670-679,10.1085/jgp.201812214,#3267,Gregorich 2019,

METHODS: Mitochondrial fractions were prepared from skeletal muscle samples collected from eight subjects with low-tension glaucoma. Their oxidative metabolism was compared with that of age- and sex-matched controls. Skeletal muscle DNA prepared from the subjects with glaucoma was also screened for the 3,460, 11,778, and 14,484 mitochondrial DNA mutations that are associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. RESULTS: No subject with low-tension glaucoma had a defect in respiratory chain activity or one of three mitochondrial DNA mutations that are commonly associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.

586,20716113.0,Epac as a novel effector of airway smooth muscle relaxation.,J Cell Mol Med,"Dysfunctional regulation of airway smooth muscle tone is a feature of obstructive airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Airway smooth muscle contraction is directly associated with changes in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), which is increased by Rho and decreased by Rac. Although cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating agents are believed to relieve bronchoconstriction mainly via activation of protein kinase A (PKA), here we addressed the role of the novel cAMP-mediated exchange protein Epac in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone. Isometric tension measurements showed that specific activation of Epac led to relaxation of guinea pig tracheal preparations pre-contracted with methacholine, independently of PKA. In airway smooth muscle cells, Epac activation reduced methacholine-induced MLC phosphorylation. Moreover, when Epac was stimulated, we observed a decreased methacholine-induced RhoA activation, measured by both stress fibre formation and pull-down assay whereas the same Epac activation prevented methacholine-induced Rac1 inhibition measured by pull-down assay. Epac-driven inhibition of both methacholine-induced muscle contraction by Toxin B-1470, and MLC phosphorylation by the Rac1-inhibitor NSC23766, were significantly attenuated, confirming the importance of Rac1 in Epac-mediated relaxation. Importantly, human airway smooth muscle tissue also expresses Epac, and Epac activation both relaxed pre-contracted human tracheal preparations and decreased MLC phosphorylation. Collectively, we show that activation of Epac relaxes airway smooth muscle by decreasing MLC phosphorylation by skewing the balance of RhoA/Rac1 activation towards Rac1. Therefore, activation of Epac may have therapeutical potential in the treatment of obstructive airway diseases.",2011,15,7,1551-63,10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01150.x,#3269,Roscioni 2011,
587,11906320.0,Effects of nitric oxide donors and inhibitors of nitric oxide signalling on endothelin- and serotonin-induced contractions in human placental arteries.,Acta Physiol Scand,"In order to explore the role of nitric oxide (NO) in the control of fetoplacental vascular tone in normal pregnancy we have examined the effects of NO donors on uteroplacental arteries pre-contracted with the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) or serotonin (5-HT). We have furthermore examined the effects of guanylate cyclase inhibitors on the NO-induced relaxation. Segments of placental arteries (n=102) obtained from 39 placentas immediately after delivery were mounted in organ baths and superfused with Krebs-Ringer solution at 37 degrees C. The vessel segments were exposed to drugs for various intervals and the tension was recorded isometrically and registered on a polygraph. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) analysis was performed after extraction of vessel segments using a specific radioimmunoassay. The placental artery segments responded to ET-1 and 5-HT with a dose-dependent vasoconstriction. After pre-contraction with ET-1 (10(-7) M) or 5-HT (10(-6) M), the vessels relaxed in response to the NO donors glyceryltrinitrate (GTN) (10(-6) M) and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) (10(-5) M). In the presence of the non-specific guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY 83583 (10(-6) M), the vessels responded with a small contraction. In the presence of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor 1H[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) the non-treated vessels responded with a relaxation. 1H[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one gave no obvious relaxation in pre-contracted vessels. Addition of 8-Br-cGMP, the cell-permeant analogue of cGMP, with or without pre-contraction had no effect on the vessels. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate analysis showed that GTN treatment caused an increase in cGMP after 12 min. Our results indicate that NO acts as a vasodilator in placental vessels. The cGMP-dependent mechanisms may be involved in NO-induced relaxation but cGMP-independent mechanisms appear also to be involved.",2002,174,3,217-23,10.1046/j.1365-201x.2002.00939.x,#3270,Sand 2002,
588,1374138.0,Reorganization of basement membrane matrices by cellular traction promotes the formation of cellular networks in vitro.,Lab Invest,"Vascular endothelial cells that are cultured on layers of gelled basement membrane matrix organize rapidly into networks of cords or tubelike structures. Although this phenomenon is a potential model for angiogenesis in vivo, we questioned whether basement membrane matrix directs the differentiation of endothelial cells in a specific manner. In this study, we have examined factors that influence the formation of cellular networks in vitro in an attempt to define a basic mechanism for this process. We found that endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and cells of the murine Leydig cell line TM3 formed networks on basement membrane matrix in much the same fashion. Light and electron microscopy, combined with time-lapse videomicroscopy, revealed that cells organized on a tesselated network of aligned basement membrane matrix that was generated by tension forces of cellular traction. Cellular elongation and progressive motility across the surface of the gel were restricted to tracks of aligned matrix and did not occur until the tracks appeared. The formation of cellular networks on basement membrane matrix was inhibited by reducing the thickness of the matrix, by including native type I collagen in the matrix, or by disrupting cytoskeletal microfilaments and microtubules. Cell division was not required for network formation. Bovine aortic endothelial cells that formed networks did not simultaneously transcribe mRNA for type I collagen, a protein synthesized by endothelial cells that form tubes spontaneously in vitro. Moreover, levels of mRNA for fibronectin and SPARC (Secreted Protein that is Acidic and Rich in Cysteine) in network-forming cells were similar to levels seen in endothelial cells that did not form networks. Endothelial cells and TM3 cells that were plated on highly malleable gels of native type I collagen also formed cords and aligned matrix fibers into linear tracks that resembled those generated on basement membrane matrix, although the structures were not as well-defined. Our observations suggest that the mechanochemical properties of extracellular matrices are able to translate the forces of cellular traction into templates that direct the formation of complex cellular patterns.",1992,66,5,536-47,,#3271,Vernon 1992,

We showed previously that quercetin (Q) partially protected dystrophic limb muscles from disease-related injury. As quercetin activates PGC-1α through Sirtuin-1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, the depleted NAD(+) in dystrophic skeletal muscle may limit quercetin efficacy; hence, supplementation with the NAD(+) donor, nicotinamide riboside (NR), may facilitate quercetin efficacy. Lisinopril (Lis) protects skeletal muscle and improves cardiac function in dystrophin-deficient mice; therefore, it was included in this study to evaluate the effects of lisinopril used with quercetin and NR. Our purpose was to determine the extent to which Q, NR, and Lis decreased dystrophic injury. We hypothesized that Q, NR, or Lis alone would improve muscle function and decrease histological injury and when used in combination would have additive effects. Muscle function of 11-mo-old DBA (healthy), D2-mdx (dystrophin-deficient), and D2-mdx mice was assessed after treatment with Q, NR, and/or Lis for 7 mo. To mimic typical pharmacology of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a group was treated with prednisolone (Pred) in combination with Q, NR, and Lis. At 11 mo of age, dystrophin deficiency decreased specific tension and tetanic force in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles and was not corrected by any treatment. Dystrophic muscle was more sensitive to contraction-induced injury, which was partially offset in the QNRLisPred group, whereas fatigue was similar between all groups. Treatments did not decrease histological damage. These data suggest that treatment with Q, NR, Lis, and Pred failed to adequately maintain dystrophic limb muscle function or decrease histological damage.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite a compelling rationale and previous evidence to the contrary in short-term investigations, quercetin, nicotinamide riboside, or Lisinopril, alone or in combination, failed to restore muscle function or decrease histological injury in dystrophic limb muscle from D2-mdx mice after long-term administration.

590,20713189.0,Hypoxia-induced changes in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance: where is the O2 sensor?,Respir Physiol Neurobiol,"Pulmonary arteries (PA) constrict in response to alveolar hypoxia, whereas systemic arteries (SA) undergo dilation. These physiological responses reflect the need to improve gas exchange in the lung, and to enhance the delivery of blood to hypoxic systemic tissues. An important unresolved question relates to the underlying mechanism by which the vascular cells detect a decrease in oxygen tension and translate that into a signal that triggers the functional response. A growing body of work implicates the mitochondria, which appear to function as O2 sensors by initiating a redox-signaling pathway that leads to the activation of downstream effectors that regulate vascular tone. However, the direction of this redox signal has been the subject of controversy. Part of the problem has been the lack of appropriate tools to assess redox signaling in live cells. Recent advancements in the development of redox sensors have led to studies that help to clarify the nature of the hypoxia-induced redox signaling by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, these studies provide valuable insight regarding the basis for discrepancies in earlier studies of the hypoxia-induced mechanism of redox signaling. Based on recent work, it appears that the O2 sensing mechanism in both the PA and SA are identical, that mitochondria function as the site of O2 sensing, and that increased ROS release from these organelles leads to the activation of cell-specific, downstream vascular responses.",2010,174,3,201-11,10.1016/j.resp.2010.08.007,#3273,Waypa 2010,

The inhibitory potency of L-NMMA and L-NAME was similar. Addition of L-NMMA or L-NAME to the organ bath did not induce any significant changes in the resting tension of the tissues. The effects of L-NMMA were reversed by L-arginine (3 x 10(-4) M). The L-NMMA enantiomer, D-NMMA (10(-4) M), did not influence either the basal tone of the preparation or the relaxing effects of acetylcholine. Arterial relaxations induced by sodium nitroprusside (10(-6) M) were not influenced by incubation with L-NMMA or L-NAME.

Its prevention and treatment are still difficult as its pathogenesis is unclear. It was reported that PDGFRα(+) muscle cells in skeletal muscle may participate in the formation of HO; however, the specific mechanism is still unknown. This study investigated the function of miR-19b-3p in osteogenic differentiation of PDGFRα(+) muscle cells. MiR-19b-3p was upregulated during PDGFRα(+) muscle cell osteogenic differentiation. The exogenous expression of miR-19b-3p led to an increase in osteogenic marker gene transcription and translation during the osteogenic differentiation of PDGFRα(+) muscle cells. Furthermore, both alkaline phosphatase and alizarin red staining increased in miR-19b-3p mimic transfected cells. Over-expression of miR-19b-3p led to the down-regulation of gene of phosphate and tension homology deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN). Additionally, the dual luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that PTEN was a direct target of miR-19b-3p. The increase of osteocalcin, osteopontin, and Runt-related transcription factor 2 protein levels induced by ectopic miR-19b-3p expression could be partially reversed by PTEN over-expression. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-19b-3p may be a promising target in inhibiting PDGFRα(+) muscle cell osteogenic differentiation and treatment of HO.",2019,43,5,565-573,10.1002/cbin.11133,#3275,Zhu 2019,PDGFRÎ±+ muscle cells

Investigators, however, have presented very little empirical research in which they have documented the biomechanics of these exercises or have determined the optimum angle of decline used. OBJECTIVE: To determine the involvement of the gastrocnemius and rectus femoris muscles and the external ankle and knee joint moments at 60 degrees of knee flexion while performing a single-limb squat at different decline angles. DESIGN: Participants acted as their own controls in a repeated-measures design. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: We recruited 10 participants who had no pain, injury, or neurologic disorder. INTERVENTION(S): Participants performed single-limb squats at different decline angles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Angle-specific knee and ankle moments were calculated at 60 degrees of knee flexion. Angle-specific electromyography (EMG) activity was calculated at 60 degrees of knee flexion. Integrated EMG also was calculated to determine the level of muscle activity over the entire squat. RESULTS: An increase was seen in the knee moments (P < .05) and integrated EMG in the rectus femoris (P < .001) as the decline angle increased. A decrease was seen in the ankle moments as the decline angle increased (P = .001), but EMG activity in the gastrocnemius increased between 16 degrees and 24 degrees (P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: As the decline angle increased, the knee extensor moment and EMG activity increased. As the decline angle increased, the ankle plantar-flexor moments decreased; however, an increase in the EMG activity was seen with the 24 degrees decline angle compared with the 16 degrees decline angle. This indicates that decline squats at an angle greater than 16 degrees may not reduce passive calf tension, as was suggested previously, and may provide no mechanical advantage for the knee.",2008,43,5,477-82,10.4085/1062-6050-43.5.477,#3276,Richards 2008,electromyography
594,34062239.0,Complex functionality of protein phosphatase 1 isoforms in the heart.,Cell Signal,"Protein phosphatase 1(PP1) is a key regulator of cardiac function through dephosphorylating serine/threonine residues within target proteins to oppose the function of protein kinases. Studies from failing hearts of animal models and human patients have demonstrated significant increase of PP1 activity in myocardium, while elevated PP1 activity in transgenic mice leads to cardiac dysfunction, suggesting that PP1 might be a therapeutic target to ameliorate cardiac dysfunction in failing hearts. In fact, cardiac overexpression of inhibitor 1, the endogenous inhibitor of PP1, increases cardiac contractility and suppresses heart failure progression. However, this notion of PP1 inhibition for heart failure treatment has been challenged by recent studies on the isoform-specific roles of PP1 in the heart. PP1 is a holoenzyme composed of catalytic subunits (PP1α, PP1β, or PP1γ) and regulatory proteins that target them to distinct subcellular locations for functional specificity. This review will summarize how PP1 regulates phosphorylation of some of the key cardiac proteins involved in Ca(2+) handling and cardiac contraction, and the potential role of PP1 isoforms in controlling cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",2021,85,,110059,10.1016/j.cellsig.2021.110059,#3277,Liu 2021,Ca(2+) cycling
595,26103985.0,Specificity of arrestin subtypes in regulating airway smooth muscle G protein-coupled receptor signaling and function.,FASEB J,"Arrestins have been shown to regulate numerous G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in studies employing receptor/arrestin overexpression in artificial cell systems. Which arrestin isoforms regulate which GPCRs in primary cell types is poorly understood. We sought to determine the effect of β-arrestin-1 or β-arrestin-2 inhibition or gene ablation on signaling and function of multiple GPCRs endogenously expressed in airway smooth muscle (ASM). In vitro [second messenger (calcium, cAMP generation)], ex vivo (ASM tension generation in suspended airway), and in vivo (invasive airway resistance) analyses were performed on human ASM cells and murine airways/whole animal subject to β-arrestin-1 or -2 knockdown or knockout (KO). In both human and murine model systems, knockdown or KO of β-arrestin-2 relative to control missense small interfering RNA or wild-type mice selectively increased (40-60%) β2-adrenoceptor signaling and function. β-arrestin-1 knockdown or KO had no effect on signaling and function of β2-adrenoceptor or numerous procontractile GPCRs, but selectively inhibited M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signaling (∼50%) and function (∼25% ex vivo, >50% in vivo) without affecting EC50 values. Arrestin subtypes differentially regulate ASM GPCRs and β-arrestin-1 inhibition represents a novel approach to managing bronchospasm in obstructive lung diseases.",2015,29,10,4227-35,10.1096/fj.15-273094,#3278,Pera 2015,M3 mAChR

A reduction in intracellular calcium is essential for relaxation. Therefore we aimed to clarify the extrusion mechanisms of intracellular calcium ions in pregnant human myometrium. STUDY DESIGN: Isometric contraction of small muscle bundles obtained from human myometrium at term was recorded. High-potassium and sodium-free solutions could induce stable contractures that revealed initial phasic contractions followed by tonic contractions. The effects of external calcium, external magnesium, nifedipine, and calcium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors on both contractures were then examined. RESULTS: Because maximum tonic contraction was induced by 48 mmol/L potassium, this concentration was used. Both contractures depended on external calcium concentrations. Nifedipine, 10(-7) mol/L inhibited both initial phasic contractions and the tonic phase of the high-potassium contracture; however, it could not suppress the tonic phase of the sodium-free contracture. Calcium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors, cyclopiazonic acid and lauryl sulfate, potentiated the tensions of tonic phases in both contractures; the effect of lauryl sulfate was stronger than that of cyclopiazonic acid. When external magnesium was gradually increased (from 0 to 9.6 mmol/L), both phasic contractions and the tonic phase of the high-potassium contracture transiently increased, followed by a reduction of tension, whereas the tonic phase of the sodium-free contracture was markedly inhibited by magnesium in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The presence of the sodium-calcium exchange mechanism and the specific inhibitory effect of magnesium were indicated in human myometrium during pregnancy. These mechanisms might prevent the long tonic contractions, to protect the fetus from hypoxia during pregnancy and parturition.",1995,172,1 Pt 1,186-95,10.1016/0002-9378(95)90111-6,#3279,Morishita 1995,
597,15209532.0,Endothelium-dependent responses in small human mesenteric arteries.,Physiol Res,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the endothelial function in human mesenteric arteries with specific reference to defining the role of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO) and the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Isolated segments of small human mesenteric arteries (225-450 microm inner diameter) were mounted in organ baths for recording isometric tension. In arteries precontracted with U46619 (thromboxane A(2) analogue, 10(-7) M), endothelium-dependent relaxations were induced in a concentration-dependent manner by substance P and histamine. In normal Krebs solution the relaxations to substance P (10(-9) M) and histamine (10(-7) M) were not significantly affected by preincubation with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 10(-4) M) or indomethacin (10(-5) M). When the preparations were exposed to a solution containing 60 mM KCl, stable contractions were induced, but relaxations could still be induced by substance P and histamine. When the arteries were further preincubated with L-NNA, the relaxations were almost abolished. A combination of apamin (3 x 10(-7) M) and charybdotoxin (10(-9) M) almost abolished relaxations in normal Krebs solution. It is concluded that isolated human mesenteric arteries respond to substance P and histamine with relaxations that are endothelium-dependent. Synthesis of both EDNO and EDHF seem important for these relaxations, whereas prostaglandins seem to be of minor importance.",2004,53,3,255-63,,#3280,Tottrup 2004,

Twenty-four healthy and independent living older adults (9 men, 15 women) with a mean age of 79.1±5.8years participated. Based on gait speed, handgrip strength and muscle mass all subjects were categorized into one of the three conceptual sarcopenia stages (pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia, severe sarcopenia). Maximal strength of dorsiflexors in the left leg was measured and voluntary activation was assessed by the interpolated twitch technique. In addition, isometric evoked contractile properties were recorded. Skeletal muscle mass was assessed by ultrasound from nine sites. There were roughly equal number of subjects in each sarcopenic category, and age was not different among the 3 groups. There were no differences in handgrip strength and skeletal muscle mass index among the 3 groups. Gait speed was significantly slower (p<0.01) in the severe sarcopenic subjects compared to the pre-sarcopenic group. With no differences in voluntary activation among the groups, the maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) for severe sarcopenic subjects were 29% lower (p=0.02) and with 19% slower (p=0.02) voluntary rates of torque development (RTD) compared to sarcopenic subjects. Furthermore, the severe group was 34% lower (p=0.04) with 36% slower (p=0.02) RTD compared to pre-sarcopenic subjects. Peak twitch tension was 54% lower (p<0.01) in the severe group compared with the pre-sarcopenic group. Maximal twitch RTD were 40% (p=0.03) slower for the severe group compared to the sarcopenia group, and 51% slower (p=0.03) compared with the pre-sarcopenia group, but when normalized to peak torques there were no statistical differences. The laboratory tests found neuromuscular differences among the 3 groups which generally supported the classification scheme and helped to illustrate some key factors that could explain differences in functional capacities. These initial findings support the assumption that this categorization is relevant for identifying older adults with different neuromuscular properties. However, further studies are needed to provide more insight into the specific neuromuscular changes in the three sarcopenia stages, and how these changes relate to functional capacity. Such studies could ultimately contribute to identifying optimal interventions to improve neuromuscular functioning.",2016,81,,28-36,10.1016/j.exger.2016.04.014,#3281,Morat 2016,Dorsiflexion
599,30777094.0,The acute effects of caffeine intake on time under tension and power generated during the bench press movement.,J Int Soc Sports Nutr,"BACKGROUND: The ability to generate high levels of power is one of the key factors determining success in many sport disciplines. Although there are studies confirming ergogenic effects of caffeine (CAF) on different physical and mental abilities, much controversy remains about its influence on power. The main goal of this study was to assess the effects of caffeine supplementation on time under tension (TUT) and the number of performed repetitions (REP). The second objective was to determine the effects of CAF supplementation on power (P) and movement velocity (V) during the bench press movement. Additionally the authors evaluated whether CAF has a significant effect on velocity of the bar in the eccentric (ECC) phase (VE(MEAN)) of the bench press movement. METHODS: The study included 20 men (20-31 yrs., 87.3 ± 7.7 kg) with at least 2 years of experience in resistance training. The study participants were divided randomly into two groups: the supplemented group ingested caffeine before exercise (G(CAF)), while the control group was given a placebo (G(CON)). The exercise protocol consisted of performing the bench press movement with a load equal to 70%1RM with maximal possible velocity (X/0/X/0). The experimental sets were performed to momentary muscular failure. RESULTS: The repeated measures ANOVA between the G(CAF) and G(CON) groups revealed statistically significant differences in 2 variables. Post-hoc tests demonstrated statistically significant differences in TUT when comparing the group supplemented with caffeine (13.689 s G(CAF)) to the one ingesting a placebo (15.332 s G(CON)) at p = 0.002. Significant differences were also observed in mean velocity during the eccentric phase of movement (0.690 m/s in the G(CAF) to 0.609 in G(CON) with p = 0.002). There were no significant differences in generated power and velocity in the CON phase of the movement between the G(CAF) and G(CON.) CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of the study is that CAF ingestion increases movement velocity of the bar in the eccentric phase of the movement, what results in shortening of the time under tension (TUT) needed for performing a specific number of repetitions, without decreasing power and velocity in the CON phase of the movement.",2019,16,1,8,10.1186/s12970-019-0275-x,#3282,Wilk 2019,Eccentric contraction
600,20884359.0,Representation of somatosensory inputs within the cortical autonomic network.,Neuroimage,"Regions of the cortical autonomic network (CAN) are activated during muscle contraction. However, it is not known to what extent CAN activation patterns reflect muscle sensory inputs, top-down signals from the motor cortex, and/or motor drive to cardiovascular structures. The present study explored the functional representation of somatosensory afferent input within the CAN with an a priori interest in the insula and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) (n=12). Heart rate (HR) and functional MRI data were acquired during 1) 30s periods of electrical stimulation of the wrist flexors at sub-motor (SUB; Type I,II afferents) and 2) motor thresholds (MOT; Type I,II,III afferents), 3) volitional wrist flexion at 5% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) to match the MOT tension (VOL5%), and 4) volitional handgrip at 35% MVC to elicit tachycardia (VOL35%). Compared with rest, HR did not change during SUB, MOT, or VOL5% but increased during VOL35% (p<0.001). High frequency HR variability was 29.42±18.87 ms(2) (mean±S.D.) at rest and 39.85±27.60 ms(2) during SUB (p=0.06). High frequency HR variability was decreased during VOL35% compared to rest (p≤0.005). SUB increased activity in the bilateral posterior insula, vMPFC, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), and posterior cingulate cortex. MOT increased activity in the left posterior insula and MCC. During VOL5%, activity increased in the right anterior-mid insula. VOL35% was associated with activity in the bilateral insula as well as vMPFC and subgenual ACC deactivation. These data suggest that the left posterior insula processes sensory input from muscle during passive conditions and specifically that Type I and/or II muscle afferent stimulation during SUB impacts the vMPFC and/or subgenual ACC, regions believed to be involved in brain default mode and parasympathetic activity.",2011,54,2,1211-20,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.050,#3283,Goswami 2011,

A significant proportion of them entails large defects, often difficult to primarily close without advanced techniques. Injection of botulinum toxin preoperatively at specific points targeting lateral abdominal wall musculature has been recently introduced as an adjunct in achieving primary fascia closure rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted investigating the role of botulinum toxin in abdominal wall reconstruction focusing on anatomic repair of hernia defects. RESULTS: Injecting botulinum toxin preoperatively achieved chemical short-term paralysis of the lateral abdominal wall muscles, enabling a tension-free closure of the midline, which according to anatomic and clinical studies should be the goal of hernia repair. No significant complications from botulinum injections for complex hernias were reported. CONCLUSION: Botulinum is a significant adjunct to complex abdominal wall reconstruction.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Proliferating VSMCs were cultured from human saphenous veins. Intracellular calcium was measured using fura-2, whole-cell current was recorded using patch-clamp and cell migration quantified in modified Boyden chambers. Subcellular protein localization was determined by microscopy. Isometric tension was recorded from mouse aortic rings. KEY RESULTS: Molecular disruption and rescue experiments indicated the importance of Orai1 in calcium entry caused by store depletion evoked passively or by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), suggesting the presence of Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels like those of the immune system. The CRAC channel blocker, S66, was a potent inhibitor of the VSMC signals, IC(50) 26 nM, which was almost two orders of magnitude greater than with leucocytes. S66 had no effect on PDGF- and ATP-evoked calcium release, overexpressed transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)5 channels, native TRPC1/5-containing channels, stromal interaction molecule 1 clustering, non-selective cationic current evoked by store depletion and phenylephrine-evoked aortic contraction. S66 reduced PDGF-evoked VSMC migration while having only modest effects on cell proliferation and no effect on cell viability. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The data suggest that Orai1 has a role in human VSMC migration, and that a CRAC channel inhibitor has high potency and selectivity for the associated calcium entry, suggesting a distinct characteristic of vascular CRAC channels and the potential for selective chemical suppression of vascular remodelling.",2011,164,2,382-93,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01368.x,#3285,Li 2011,
603,25387260.0,Weekly versus monthly testosterone administration on fast and slow skeletal muscle fibers in older adult males.,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"CONTEXT: In older adults, loss of mobility due to sarcopenia is exacerbated in men with low serum T. T replacement therapy is known to increase muscle mass and strength, but the effect of weekly (WK) vs monthly (MO) administration on specific fiber types is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of WK vs MO T replacement on the size and functional capacity of individual fast and slow skeletal muscle fiber types. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Subjects were randomized into a 5-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All subjects (ages, 61-71 y) were community-dwelling men who had T levels < 500 ng/dL. INTERVENTION: Subjects were dosed weekly for 5 months, receiving continuous T (WK, n = 5; 100 mg T enanthate, im injection), monthly cycled T (MO, n = 7; alternating months of T and placebo), or placebo (n = 7). Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis were obtained before and after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcomes for individual slow and fast fibers included fiber diameter, peak force (P0), rate of tension development, maximal shortening velocity, peak power, and Ca(2+) sensitivity. RESULTS: Both treatments increased fiber diameter and peak power, with WK treatment 5-fold more effective than MO in increasing type I fiber P0. WK effects on fiber diameter and force were 1.5-fold higher in slow fibers compared to fast fibers. In fast type II fibers, diameter and P0 increased similarly between treatments. The increased power was entirely due to increased fiber size and force. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, T replacement effects were fiber-type dependent, restricted to increases in cell size, P0, and peak power, and dependent on the paradigm selected (WK vs MO).",2015,100,2,E223-31,10.1210/jc.2014-2759,#3286,Fitts 2015,

The somatopsychic imbalance in asthma: towards a holistic therapy.,J Asthma Res,"While the standard physiological and even certain psychological characteristics of asthmatic patients are well known, the current diagnostic and therapeutic approach to asthma remains inadequate, as it neglects certain interrelated somatopsychic factors vital to an optimal diagnostic-therapeutic programme. These include the role of skeletal muscle tension and posture, the role of the 'voluntary' respiratory musculature, especially the diaphragm, as well as anxiety, emotional suppression and excessive self-consciousness, all of which may be precipitants rather than the outcome of the onset of asthma. On the basis of these neglected factors and others, implications for an optimally effective therapy are discussed. The physical medicine or physiotherapeutic, as well as other recent therapeutic approaches, are reviewed and evaluated.

BACKGROUND: Although BT-A has received mixed support for the treatment of TTH, deliberate injection directly into the cervical MTPs very often found in this population has not been formally evaluated. METHODS: Patients with CTTH and specific MTPs producing referred head pain were assigned randomly to receive intramuscular injections of BT-A or isotonic saline (placebo) in a double-blind design. Daily headache diaries, pill counts, trigger point pressure algometry, range of motion assessment, and responses to standardized pain and psychological questionnaires were used as outcome measures; patients returned for follow-up assessment at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months post injection. After 3 months, all patients were offered participation in an open-label extension of the study. Effect sizes were calculated to index treatment effects among the intent-to-treat population; individual time series models were computed for average pain intensity. RESULTS: The 23 participants reported experiencing headache on a near-daily basis (average of 27 days/month). Compared with placebo, patients in the BT-A group reported greater reductions in headache frequency during the first part of the study (P = .013), but these effects dissipated by week 12. Reductions in headache intensity over time did not differ significantly between groups (P = .80; maximum d = 0.13), although a larger proportion of BT-A patients showed evidence of statistically significant improvements in headache intensity in the time series analyses (62.5% for BT-A vs 30% for placebo). There were no differences between the groups on any of the secondary outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for BT-A in headache is mixed, and even more so in CTTH. However, the putative technique of injecting BT-A directly into the ubiquitous MTPs in CTTH is partially supported in this pilot study. Definitive trials with larger samples are needed to test this hypothesis further.",2009,49,5,732-43,10.1111/j.1526-4610.2008.01286.x,#3288,Harden 2009,

This model has been applied to investigate the relative roles of cellular scale length dependent regulators of tension generation on the transduction of work from the cell to whole organ pump function. Specifically, the role of the length dependent Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension (Ca(50)), filament overlap tension dependence, velocity dependence of tension, and tension dependent binding of Ca(2+) to Troponin C on metrics of efficient transduction of work and stress and strain homogeneity were predicted by performing simulations in the absence of each of these feedback mechanisms. The length dependent Ca(50) and the filament overlap, which make up the Frank-Starling Law, were found to be the two dominant regulators of the efficient transduction of work. Analyzing the fiber velocity field in the absence of the Frank-Starling mechanisms showed that the decreased efficiency in the transduction of work in the absence of filament overlap effects was caused by increased post systolic shortening, whereas the decreased efficiency in the absence of length dependent Ca(50) was caused by an inversion in the regional distribution of strain.",2009,5,4,e1000371,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000371,#3290,Niederer 2009,

This study aimed to verify the neuromuscular adaptations that occurred following 16-week interventions with two CT models in older men: high-intensity interval training (HIIT) combined with either TST or PT. METHODS: Thirty-five older men (65.8 ± 3.9 years) were randomly assigned into one of two training groups CTS: TST + HIIT (n = 18) or CTP: PT + HIIT (n = 17). CTS performed resistance training at intensities ranging from 65 to 80% of 1 RM at slow controlled speed, whereas CTP trained at intensities ranging from 40 to 60% of 1 RM at maximal intentional speed. Lower body one-repetition maximum (1 RM), isometric rate of force development (RFD), countermovement jump (CMJ) muscle power output, quadriceps femoris muscles thickness (QF MT), and peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak)) were assessed before training and after 8 and 16 weeks of CT. RESULTS: Groups improved similarly in all primary outcomes (P < 0.05), with mean increases ranging: 1 RM (from 39.4 to 75.8%); RFD (from 9.9 to 64.8%); and CMJ muscle power (from 1.8 to 5.2%). Significant increases (P < 0.05) were observed in all secondary outcomes (QF MT, specific tension and VO(2peak)) with no differences between groups.

RESULTS: Relaxing effects of ureteral muscle tension were observed in the rank order VAR>SIL>TAD. While only VAR significantly elevated cGMP levels 3.3-fold over control, no increase for cAMP levels was observed.

Subjects are equipped with a garment that can be worn under the clothes during daily work. Dry surface electrodes incorporated in this garment measure muscle activation (sEMG) of the trapezius muscle. The garment is connected to an ambulant device that provides feedback to the subject when muscle relaxation is insufficient. sEMG data are also sent to a secured server that is accessible by therapists for remote counseling purposes. In conformance with the evaluation stages of DeChant, RSMT was evaluated on technical feasibility, patient satisfaction, and changes in clinical outcomes. In addition, subjects were asked about their willingness to pay. The study population consisted of 10 female workers suffering from neck-shoulder pain related to computer work. Results show that in 78% of the remote counseling sessions, sufficient amounts of data were available at the server for the therapist to make an assessment of muscle tension needed for the remote counseling sessions. Subjects were highly satisfied about the usefulness and ease of use of the remote counseling. However, they were less satisfied with the technical functioning of the myofeedback system. Eighty percent of the subjects reported a reduction in pain intensity and disability directly after RSMT. Subjects were willing to contribute a maximum of 200 euro for RSMT. Based on this study, it can be concluded that RSMT is technically feasible and induces changes in clinical outcomes.

611,19838951.0,Desmin expression in human cardiomyocytes and selected clinical and echocardiographic parameters in patients with chronic heart failure.,Kardiol Pol,"BACKGROUND: Desmin, one of the basic muscular-specific structural proteins, is believed to play an important role in the progression of heart failure (HF). The function of desmin in cardiomyocytes is still unclear. Mechanical, structural and regulatory functions are postulated. Regulatory function of desmin seems the most interesting. Desmin might be involved in the regulation of gene expression, myofibrillogenesis and intercellular signalling, and be responsible for shape and tension of the cell membrane and other organelles. Abnormal accumulation of desmin may disturb the function of myofibrils, lead to unusual tension of sarcolemma and atypical distribution of organelles (nucleus), and impair intra- and intercellular communication. AIM: Evaluation of desmin expression in specimens derived from right ventricular myocardium during endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). METHODS: The study population consisted of 135 patients (86.7% males, mean age 49.4 +/- 14.1 years) presenting with clinical symptoms of HF and LVEF < 45%. During EMB 3-4 samples were taken from the right ventricular myocardium. The immunohistochemical studies of the endomyocardial specimens included immunostaining with desmin-specific antibodies. The study population was divided into three groups: I - 48 patients with normal expression of desmin, II - 54 patients with increased expression and accumulation of desmin and III - 33 patients with low expression of desmin in cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: The LVEF was significantly higher in group I than in groups II and III. The LV diameter was significantly lower in group I than in groups II and III. Functional status according to NYHA class was the worst in group I compared to group II and III. These differences were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of desmin distribution in specimens derived from the right ventricular myocardium may be useful as an objective tool in the assessment of left ventricle status.",2009,67,9,955-61,,#3295,Pawlak 2009,
612,18550978.0,Chronic stretching and voluntary muscle force.,J Strength Cond Res,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether muscle force, power, and optimal length were affected by 4 weeks of static or ballistic stretching. Twenty-nine males (age, 18-60 years) performed 4 maximal hip extensions to measure peak torque (PT), rate of torque development (RTD), work (W), and PT angle (PTA). Then, participants completed 4 weeks of static or ballistic flexibility training of the hip extensors followed by repetition of the testing protocol. After training, PT increased 5.3 +/- 19.0% in the static group (SG), 7.8 +/- 12.7% in the ballistic group (BG), and 6.1 +/- 17.9% in the control group (CG). RTD increased 4.8 +/- 22.7% in the SG, 3.6 +/- 28.0% in the BG and 9.7 +/- 24.0% in the CG. W increased 3.9 +/- 7.0% in the SG, 14.7 +/- 27.4% in the BG, and 5.5 +/- 9.5% in the CG. PTA changed little with a -1.6 +/- 6.6% decrease in the SG and increases of 0.86 +/- 4.1% in the BG and 0.18 +/- 8.7% in the CG. None of the results were statistically different between stretching group and CG (alpha = 0.05). These data suggest that 4 weeks of stretching have little effect on muscle strength, power, W, or length-tension relationship. PTA changed little, suggesting that a lengthening of the muscle with stretching did not occur. It is suggested that individuals can routinely stretch following exercise to maintain flexibility but should avoid stretching prior to exercise requiring high levels of muscle force. Before exercise that requires high muscular forces, individuals may perform dynamic, sport-specific exercises to increase blood flow, metabolic activity, temperature, and compliance of the muscle.",2008,22,2,589-96,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181636aef,#3296,LaRoche 2008,
613,28097449.0,Open retromuscular large mesh reconstruction of lumbar incisional hernias including the atrophic muscular area.,Hernia,"PURPOSE: Lumbar incisional hernias (LIH) are a rare wall defect, whose surgical management is challenging because no recommendation exists. Moreover, LIH are frequently associated with flank bulging which should be taken into account during LIH surgical repair. We aimed to describe a cohort of patients operated on for LIH using a homogeneous surgical technique and to report surgical outcomes. METHODS: The records of all consecutive patients operated on in a specialized surgical center between January 2009 and January 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The same open technique was performed, i.e., using a mesh into the retroperitoneal space posteriorly, placed with the largest overlap inferiorly and posteriorly, and fixed through the controlateral abdominal wall muscles under strong tension to correct the flank bulging. RESULTS: The cohort included 31 patients, of median age 62, who presented two or more comorbidities in 68% of cases. LIH was recurrent in 45% of patients, and was related to nephrectomy in 61% of patients. The mesh was totally extraperitoneal in 65% of patients. The postoperative mortality rate was null. The rate of specific surgical complications was 32.3%, and the rate of overall postoperative morbidity (Clavien-Dindo classification) was 38.7%. After a median follow-up of 27.5 months, the recurrence rate was 6.5% and 9.7% reported chronic pain. CONCLUSION: The open approach for LIH repair was safe and enabled treating flank bulging simultaneously in all patients. Due to the paucity of adequate scientific studies, this reproducible open method could help moving toward a standardization of LIH surgical management.",2017,21,3,341-349,10.1007/s10029-016-1570-y,#3297,Renard 2017,Abdominal muscles
614,16199024.0,"Short-term treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with liver growth factor reduces carotid artery fibrosis, improves vascular function, and lowers blood pressure.",Cardiovasc Res,"OBJECTIVE: Liver growth factor (LGF), a mitogen for liver cells, reduces fibrosis in a rat model of cirrhosis. The present study assesses the possible vascular antifibrotic and antihypertensive effects of LGF treatment on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: Six-month-old male SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were treated with LGF (4.5 microg LGF/rat i.p. twice a week for 2 weeks). Haemodynamic parameters were measured in anaesthetized rats. Vascular structure and function were studied in carotid arteries using optical and confocal microscopy, radioimmunoassay for desmosine, and isometric tension recording. RESULTS: LGF reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure only in SHR. When compared to those of untreated SHR, carotid arteries from LGF-treated SHR showed: 1) a 50% reduction in collagen area and an increase in vascular smooth muscle cell number in the media, 2) no difference in total elastin content, but an increase in size of fenestrae in the internal elastic lamina, and 3) enhanced relaxation to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, and forskolin. These effects were specific for SHR, since no changes were observed in LGF-treated WKY. CONCLUSION: Short-term treatment with a low dose of LGF induced a large improvement in vascular structure and function and significantly reduced blood pressure in a rat model of essential hypertension. The present results could open future research to explore the vascular effects of this endogenous factor in order to determine its potential as an antifibrotic and antihypertensive agent in humans.",2006,69,3,764-71,10.1016/j.cardiores.2005.08.021,#3298,Somoza 2006,
615,12932421.0,Posture-dependent trunk extensor EMG activity during maximum isometrics exertions in normal male and female subjects.,J Electromyogr Kinesiol,"Posture-dependent trunk function data are important for appropriate normalization of submaximal trunk exertions, and is also necessary to define a more precise and specific use for strength testing in the prevention and diagnosis of spinal disorders. The aim of the current study was to quantify maximal effort trunk muscle extensor activity and trunk isometric extension torque over a functional range of sagittal standing postures. Twenty healthy, young adult male and female subjects performed isometric extension tasks over a sagittal posture range of -20 degrees extension to +50 degrees flexion, in 10 degrees increments. Erector spinae muscle activity was recorded bilaterally at the level of L3 using surface EMG electrodes. Isometric trunk extension torque was measured using a trunk dynamometer. EMG and trunk torque differed significantly between genders, but there were no differences between male and female subjects when the data were normalized with respect to the upright posture. For the combined male and female population, upright posture normalized L3 EMG activity (EMGn) and trunk extension torque (Tn) increased 1.7-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively, over the 70 degrees range of sagittal postures examined. The ratio (Tn/EMGn) increased two-fold (0.83 to 1.67) from -20 degrees extension to +50 degrees flexion, indicating that the neuromuscular efficiency increases with flexion. Trunk extension torque normalized with respect to the upright posture was linearly and positively correlated (r = 0.59, P < 0.001) to similarly normalized L3 EMG activity. This relatively weak correlation suggests that trunk muscle synergism and/or intrinsic muscle length-tension relationships are also modulated by posture. This study provides data that can be used to estimate trunk extensor muscle function over a broad range of sagittal postures. Our findings indicate that appropriate postural normalization of trunk extensor EMG activity is necessary for studies where submaximal trunk exertions are performed over a range of upright postures.",2003,13,5,469-76,10.1016/s1050-6411(03)00060-9,#3299,Roy 2003,

617,31905197.0,Model order reduction for left ventricular mechanics via congruency training.,PLoS One,"Computational models of the cardiovascular system and specifically heart function are currently being investigated as analytic tools to assist medical practice and clinical trials. To achieve clinical utility, models should be able to assimilate the diagnostic multi-modality data available for each patient and generate consistent representations of the underlying cardiovascular physiology. While finite element models of the heart can naturally account for patient-specific anatomies reconstructed from medical images, optimizing the many other parameters driving simulated cardiac functions is challenging due to computational complexity. With the goal of streamlining parameter adaptation, in this paper we present a novel, multifidelity strategy for model order reduction of 3-D finite element models of ventricular mechanics. Our approach is centered around well established findings on the similarity between contraction of an isolated muscle and the whole ventricle. Specifically, we demonstrate that simple linear transformations between sarcomere strain (tension) and ventricular volume (pressure) are sufficient to reproduce global pressure-volume outputs of 3-D finite element models even by a reduced model with just a single myocyte unit. We further develop a procedure for congruency training of a surrogate low-order model from multi-scale finite elements, and we construct an example of parameter optimization based on medical images. We discuss how the presented approach might be employed to process large datasets of medical images as well as databases of echocardiographic reports, paving the way towards application of heart mechanics models in the clinical practice.",2020,15,1,e0219876,10.1371/journal.pone.0219876,#3301,DiAchille 2020,
618,32667945.0,Using smartphone accelerometer data to obtain scientific mechanical-biological descriptors of resistance exercise training.,PLoS One,"BACKGROUND: Single repetition, contraction-phase specific and total time-under-tension (TUT) are crucial mechano-biological descriptors associated with distinct morphological, molecular and metabolic muscular adaptations in response to exercise, rehabilitation and/or fighting sarcopenia. However, to date, no simple, reliable and valid method has been developed to measure these descriptors. OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed to test whether accelerometer data obtained from a standard smartphone placed on the weight stack can be used to extract single repetition, contraction-phase specific and total TUT. METHODS: Twenty-two participants performed two sets of ten repetitions of their 60% one repetition maximum with a self-paced velocity on nine commonly used resistance exercise machines. Two identical smartphones were attached on the resistance exercise weight stacks and recorded all user-exerted accelerations. An algorithm extracted the number of repetitions, single repetition, contraction-phase specific and total TUT. All exercises were video-recorded. The TUT determined from the algorithmically-derived mechano-biological descriptors was compared with the video recordings that served as the gold standard. The agreement between the methods was examined using Limits of Agreement (LoA). The association was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficients and interrater reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2.1). RESULTS: The error rate of the algorithmic detection of single repetitions derived from two smartphones accelerometers was 0.16%. Comparing algorithmically-derived, contraction-phase specific TUT against video, showed a high degree of correlation (r>0.93) for all exercise machines. Agreement between the two methods was high on all exercise machines as follows: LoA ranged from -0.3 to 0.3 seconds for single repetition TUT (0.1% of mean TUT), from -0.6 to 0.3 seconds for concentric contraction TUT (7.1% of mean TUT), from -0.3 to 0.5 seconds for eccentric contraction TUT (4.1% of mean TUT) and from -1.9 to 1.1 seconds for total TUT (0.5% of mean TUT). Interrater reliability for single repetition, contraction-phase specific TUT was high (ICC > 0.99). CONCLUSION: Data from smartphone accelerometer derived resistance exercise can be used to validly and reliably extract crucial mechano-biological descriptors. Moreover, the presented multi-analytical algorithmic approach enables researchers and clinicians to reliably and validly report missing mechano-biological descriptors.",2020,15,7,e0235156,10.1371/journal.pone.0235156,#3302,Viecelli 2020,
619,17574469.0,Anatomy of the deep fascia of the upper limb. Second part: study of innervation.,Morphologie,"Analysis of specimens taken from different areas of the deep fascia in 20 upper limbs was made in order to establish which kind of nerve fibres and endings are present in the deep muscular fascia. The flexor retinaculum and the lacertus fibrosus were also evaluated because they are anatomically hardly separable from the deep muscular fascia, although they have different functions. In particular, specimens were taken at the level of: (a) the expansion of pectoralis major onto the bicipital fascia, (b) the middle third of the brachial fascia, (c) the lacertus fibrosus, (d) the middle third of the antebrachial fascia, (e) the flexor retinaculum. This study demonstrated an abundant innervation of the fascia consisting in both free nerve endings and encapsulated receptors, in particular, Ruffini and Pacini corpuscles. However, differences in innervation were verified: the flexor retinaculum was resulted the more innervated element whilst lacertus fibrosus and the pectoralis major expansion the less innervated. These results suggest that the retinaculum has more a perceptive function whereas the tendinous expansions onto the fascia have mostly a mechanical role in the transmission of tension. The hypothesis that the fascia plays an important role in proprioception, especially dynamic proprioception, is therefore advanced. In fact, the fascia is a membrane that extends throughout the whole body and numerous muscular expansions maintain it in a basal tension. During a muscular contraction these expansions could also transmit the effect of the stretch to a specific area of the fascia, stimulating the proprioceptors in that area.",2007,91,292,38-43,10.1016/j.morpho.2007.05.002,#3303,Stecco 2007,
620,8069765.0,Epithelial modulation of cholinergic responses in human tracheal smooth muscle.,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,"The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the increase in maximal responses to histamine, acetylcholine, and cholinergic electrical field stimulation and decreased relaxant responses to isoprenaline reported in asthmatic tracheal smooth muscle result from the epithelial damage observed in asthma. The effect of mechanical removal of the epithelium on contractile and relaxant responses was examined in normal human postmortem tracheal smooth muscle strips. The epithelium was removed from alternate tracheal strips obtained from 25 subjects within 14 h of sudden death from nonrespiratory causes. In paired samples, contractile cholinergic and inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (i-NANC) neural responses to electrical field stimulation and responses to exogenous histamine, potassium chloride, theophylline, and isoprenaline were unaffected by removal of the epithelium. However, the maximal isometric tension (Tmax) induced by methacholine increased by 70.1 +/- 19.8% (mean +/- SE, p < 0.005, n = 9), without alteration in EC50. These data suggest that disruption of the epithelium is unlikely to be the explanation of the abnormalities observed in trachea in fatal asthma. Explanations of the increase in maximal response to methacholine following removal of the epithelium include loss of an epithelium-derived relaxant factor released via an epithelial muscarinic receptor or loss of a specific permeability or metabolic barrier imposed by the epithelium for methacholine.",1994,72,3,199-204,10.1139/y94-031,#3304,Bai 1994,
621,34825519.0,A mathematical model of hiPSC cardiomyocytes electromechanics.,Physiol Rep,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are becoming instrumental in cardiac research, human-based cell level cardiotoxicity tests, and developing patient-specific care. As one of the principal functional readouts is contractility, we propose a novel electromechanical hiPSC-CM computational model named the hiPSC-CM-CE. This model comprises a reparametrized version of contractile element (CE) by Rice et al., 2008, with a new passive force formulation, integrated into a hiPSC-CM electrophysiology formalism by Paci et al. in 2020. Our simulated results were validated against in vitro data reported for hiPSC-CMs at matching conditions from different labs. Specifically, key action potential (AP) and calcium transient (CaT) biomarkers simulated by the hiPSC-CM-CE model were within the experimental ranges. On the mechanical side, simulated cell shortening, contraction-relaxation kinetic indices (RT(50) and RT(25) ), and the amplitude of tension fell within the experimental intervals. Markedly, as an inter-scale analysis, correct classification of the inotropic effects due to non-cardiomyocytes in hiPSC-CM tissues was predicted on account of the passive force expression introduced to the CE. Finally, the physiological inotropic effects caused by Verapamil and Bay-K 8644 and the aftercontractions due to the early afterdepolarizations (EADs) were simulated and validated against experimental data. In the future, the presented model can be readily expanded to take in pharmacological trials and genetic mutations, such as those involved in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and study arrhythmia trigger mechanisms.",2021,9,22,e15124,10.14814/phy2.15124,#3305,Forouzandehmehr 2021,action potential
622,15880140.0,Pharmacodynamics of propiverine and three of its main metabolites on detrusor contraction.,Br J Pharmacol,"1. Besides its antimuscarinic effects, propiverine may possess an additional mode of action. We compared the effects of propiverine, three of its metabolites (M-5, M-6, M-14) and atropine in human, pig and mouse urinary bladder preparations in order to elucidate the nature of a possible additional mode of action. 2. Like the parent compound, M-5, M-6 and M-14 reduced to variable degrees the contractions elicited by electric field stimulation (EFS) of isolated, urothelium-denuded detrusor strips. In mouse the atropine-resistant and therefore the nonadrenergic, noncholinergic component of contractile response to EFS was reduced by M-5, M-14 and propiverine, but was hardly affected by M-6. 3. Atropine, propiverine and M-6 significantly shifted the cumulative concentration-response curves for carbachol (CCh) to higher concentrations. Atropine and M-6 did not affect the maximum tension induced by CCh. Propiverine, M-5 and M-14 reduced the maximum CCh effect, suggesting at least one additional mode of action. This pattern of response was observed in all the three species, albeit with some differences in sensitivity to the various agents. 4. In freshly isolated human detrusor smooth muscle cells, propiverine and M-14 inhibited the nifedipine-sensitive L-type calcium current (I(Ca)) in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the effects of M-5 and M-6 on I(Ca) were insignificant in the concentration range examined. 5. The investigated responses to propiverine and its metabolites suggest that impairment of maximum CCh-induced contractions is due to strong effect on I(Ca) and that this may be associated with the presence of the aliphatic side chain.",2005,145,5,608-19,10.1038/sj.bjp.0706244,#3306,Wuest 2005,
623,31743476.0,The biomechanics of subscapularis repair in reverse shoulder arthroplasty: The effect of lateralization and insertion site.,J Orthop Res,"Functional outcomes of subscapularis (SSc) repair following reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) remains controversial. SSc repair in combination with glenosphere lateralization was reported to yield worse clinical outcomes compared with the non-lateralized glenosphere. The aim of this biomechanical study was to investigate how glenosphere lateralization and different re-insertion sites can affect the biomechanics of the SSc after RSA. Nine patient-specific RSA shoulder models were created from patients' computed tomography scans. Moment arms and SSc length were calculated for abduction, forward flexion, and internal rotation in 20° and 90° abduction for three configurations of glenosphere lateralization (standard/+0, +5, and +10 mm) and three SSc repair sites (native, superior, and inferior) and compared with the native shoulder. When compared with the native shoulder, RSA resulted in large adducting SSc moment arms that were antagonistic to the deltoid. Glenosphere lateralization had no effect on SSc moment arms in any motion. However, lateralization increased SSc tension beyond its anatomic length for +5 and +10 mm of lateralization when attached to its native insertion. A superior SSc repair site created the least adductive moment arm as well as the least amount of SSc lengthening. Increased glenosphere lateralization showed a significant increase in the SSc length, which in combination with its adductive moment arm can be antagonistic to deltoid function. However, a superior SSc repair site may help reduce the adductive SSc moment arm and allow for reduced tension on the repair as its length in that location is less than that of the native SSc. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

624,16046385.0,End-tidal pCO2 in blood phobics during viewing of emotion- and disease-related films.,Psychosom Med,"OBJECTIVE: Many patients with blood, injection, and injury (BII) phobia respond to specific stimuli with vasovagal dysregulation and fainting. However, little is known about the role of hyperventilation in the distress of these patients. Hyperventilation, defined by subnormal arterial pCO2 levels, induces anxiety and may promote the development of fainting. We studied end-tidal pCO2 in 12 patients with BII phobia and 14 nonanxious controls during presentation of emotional films. METHOD: Ten film clips were shown, two in each of 5 categories: pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, BII-related (surgery), and asthma-related (portraying labored breathing). For each subject, two subsets were created, each containing one clip from each category. For one subset, the instruction was simply to view the film, and for the other subset, to view the film while tensing the leg muscles. PCO2, heart rate, blood pressure, and leg electromyogram were recorded continuously during viewing, and self-report of symptoms and emotion was collected after each film. RESULTS: Patients reported the greatest anxiety and disgust during surgery films. PCO2 was relatively stable throughout all categories except surgery films, during which minima were below 30 mm Hg, indicating significant hypocapnia. Cardiovascular variables suggested biphasic patterns in two patients with BII phobia. These patients, together with one additional patient and one control who were close to fainting after or during one surgery film, also showed a marked fall in pCO2) Leg muscle tension raised heart rate and systolic blood pressure for all films, but was not related to near-fainting or endurance in surgery film viewing. CONCLUSION: Hyperventilation is part of the fear response of patients with BII phobia, but was transitory in experimental fear induction using surgery films. Its role in real-life exposure and fainting deserves further study.",2005,67,4,661-8,10.1097/01.psy.0000170339.06281.07,#3308,Ritz 2005,
625,12496686.0,Protein turnover in atrophying muscle: from nutritional intervention to microarray expression analysis.,Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In response to decreased usage, skeletal muscle undergoes adaptive reductive remodeling due to the decrease in tension on the weight bearing components of the musculo-skeletal system. This response occurs with uncomplicated disuse (e.g. bed rest, space flight), as a secondary consequence of several widely prevalent chronic diseases for which activity is reduced (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure) and is part of the aging process. The problem is therefore one of considerable clinical importance. RECENT FINDINGS: The impaired function and exercise intolerance is related more to the associated muscle wasting rather than to the specific organ system primarily impacted by the disease. Progress has continued in describing the use of anabolic drugs and dietary manipulation. The major advance in the field has been: (i) the discovery of the atrogin-1 gene and (ii) the application of microarray expression analysis and proteomics with the objectives of obtaining comprehensive understanding of the pathways changed with disuse atrophy. SUMMARY: Disuse atrophy is a common clinical problem. There is a need for therapeutic interventions that do not involve exercise. A better understanding of the changes, particularly at the molecular level, could indicate hitherto unsuspected sites for nutritional and pharmacological intervention.",2003,6,1,95-102,10.1097/00075197-200301000-00014,#3309,Stein 2003,NASA Center ARC
626,9758641.0,Retinal arterial tone is controlled by a retinal-derived relaxing factor.,Circ Res,"The present study provides evidence that retinal tissue may profoundly influence the retinal arterial smooth muscle cell tone by releasing an unknown retinal relaxing factor. Isolated bovine retinal arteries with and without adhering retinal tissue were mounted in a wire myograph for isometric tension recordings. The maximal contraction induced by prostaglandin F2alpha was 0.95+/-0.7 mN (n=6) in the presence and 5.15+/-0.76 mN (n=6) in the absence of adhering retinal tissue. The contractions induced by U-46619, serotonin, and endothelin-1 were similarly blocked in the presence of retinal tissue. The K+ 120 mmol/L-induced contraction was not significantly affected (2.8+/-0.7 mN, n=6, in the presence and 3. 6+/-0.7 mN, n=6, in the absence of retinal tissue). Placing a piece of bovine retinal tissue in the proximity of a contracted (ie, with prostaglandin F2alpha) retinal artery induced a complete relaxation of the retinal vessel, suggesting the involvement of a diffusible chemical vasorelaxant. Also porcine, canine, and ovine retinal tissue completely relaxed the contracted (with prostaglandin F2alpha) bovine retinal artery. Other smooth muscle preparations, including rat mesenteric and renal arteries and rat main bronchi, also relaxed with the application of a piece of bovine retinal tissue. Incubation of bovine retinas in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution yielded a solution that relaxed isolated precontracted bovine retinal arteries, confirming the involvement of a diffusible chemical messenger. Hexane extraction, heating the solution to 70 degrees C, or treatment with trypsin did not alter the relaxing properties of the incubation solution. The characteristics of the retinal relaxing factor do not correspond with those of nitric oxide, prostanoids, adenosine, acetylcholine, or any other of the known vasoactive neurotransmitters released from the retina. Our results suggest that retinal arterial tone is controlled by a diffusible, hydrophilic, and heat-stable relaxing factor that does not correspond with a known vasoactive molecule formed within the retina.",1998,83,7,714-20,10.1161/01.res.83.7.714,#3310,Delaey 1998,
627,11874390.0,5-HT1B-receptors and vascular reactivity in human isolated blood vessels: assessment of the potential craniovascular selectivity of sumatriptan.,Br J Clin Pharmacol,"AIMS: 5-HT1B-receptor mediated vasoconstriction of cranial arteries is a potential mechanism by which 5-HT1B/1D-receptor agonists such as sumatriptan produce their antimigraine effects. 5-HT1B-receptors exist in other blood vessels which may give rise to unwanted vascular effects. Therefore we examined the distribution of 5-HT1B-receptor immunoreactivity (i.r.) in human blood vessels (including target and nontarget vessels) and confirmed the functionality of this receptor protein, by comparing the vasoconstrictor effects of sumatriptan and 5-HT (the endogenous ligand) in isolated vessels. METHODS: Blood vessels (middle meningeal, pial, temporal and uterine arteries and saphenous veins) were obtained from surgical patients (with consent). Sections of the vessels were prepared for routine immunohistochemical studies using specific 5-HT1B- and 5-HT1D-receptor antibodies. For functional studies, ring segments of the vessels were mounted in organ baths for isometric tension recording. RESULTS: 5-HT1B-receptor i.r. was detected on the smooth muscle layer in middle meningeal, pial and uterine arteries and in saphenous vein and sumatriptan produced contractions in these vessels with potency values (mean pEC50) of 7.00, 7.08, 6.44 and 6.61, respectively, the magnitude of contraction was greatest in the cranial arteries with Emax values of 100.7, 60.3, 23.0 and 35.9%, respectively (expressed as a percentage of the reference agonist 45 mm KCl). 5-HT1B-receptor i.r. was not detected in temporal artery and sumatriptan had no effect in this artery. 5-HT1D-receptor i.r. was not detected in any of the vessels studied. CONCLUSIONS: Sumatriptan can evoke vasoconstriction in antimigraine target vessels and also in nontarget vessels through an action at 5-HT1B-rcceptors. Sumatriptan acts preferentially to cause contraction in human cranial arteries compared with the other blood vessels we examined and this effect is likely to be shared by other drugs of this class.",2002,53,3,266-74,10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01536.x,#3311,Razzaque 2002,
628,28437378.0,Risk Factors for Pediatric Extubation Failure: The Importance of Respiratory Muscle Strength.,Crit Care Med,"OBJECTIVE: Respiratory muscle weakness frequently develops during mechanical ventilation, although in children there are limited data about its prevalence and whether it is associated with extubation outcomes. We sought to identify risk factors for pediatric extubation failure, with specific attention to respiratory muscle strength. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTING: Tertiary care PICU. PATIENTS: Four hundred nine mechanically ventilated children. INTERVENTIONS: Respiratory measurements using esophageal manometry and respiratory inductance plethysmography were made preextubation during airway occlusion and on continuous positive airway pressure of 5 and pressure support of 10 above positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O, as well as 5 and 60 minutes postextubation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (8.3%) were reintubated within 48 hours of extubation. Reintubation risk factors included lower maximum airway pressure during airway occlusion (aPiMax) preextubation, longer length of ventilation, postextubation upper airway obstruction, high respiratory effort postextubation (pressure rate product, pressure time product, tension time index), and high postextubation phase angle. Nearly 35% of children had diminished respiratory muscle strength (aPiMax ≤ 30 cm H2O) at the time of extubation, and were nearly three times more likely to be reintubated than those with preserved strength (aPiMax > 30 cm H2O; 14% vs 5.5%; p = 0.006). Reintubation rates exceeded 20% when children with low aPiMax had moderately elevated effort after extubation (pressure rate product > 500), whereas children with preserved aPiMax had reintubation rates greater than 20% only when postextubation effort was very high (pressure rate product > 1,000). When children developed postextubation upper airway obstruction, reintubation rates were 47.4% for those with low aPiMax compared to 15.4% for those with preserved aPiMax (p = 0.02). Multivariable risk factors for reintubation included acute neurologic disease, lower aPiMax, postextubation upper airway obstruction, higher preextubation positive end-expiratory pressure, higher postextubation pressure rate product, and lower height. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular weakness at the time of extubation was common in children and was independently associated with reintubation, particularly when postextubation effort was high.",2017,45,8,e798-e805,10.1097/CCM.0000000000002433,#3312,Khemani 2017,
629,2165189.0,The effects of cooling on human saphenous vein reactivity to adrenergic agonists.,J Vasc Surg,"Human saphenous veins were obtained at surgery and assayed immediately (n = 10). The veins were cut into rings, suspended in organ chambers, and connected to force transducers for the recording of isometric tension. One ring served as control whereas others were treated with the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (3 X 10(-7) mol/L), or the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (10(-7) mol/L). In quiescent rings cooling from 37 degrees C to 24 degrees C had no significant effect. Norepinephrine (10(-8)-10(-5) mol/L) caused concentration-dependent contractions with an EC20 (-log concentration of norepinephrine required to induce contractions 20% of maximal) = 6.97 +/- 0.10. The contractions were inhibited by prazosin (EC20 = 5.89 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.001) and rauwolscine (ED20 = 5.78 +/- 0.11, p less than 0.001). In control rings cooling potentiated contractions evoked at concentrations of norepinephrine below 10(-6) mol/L and inhibited those at higher concentrations. In rings treated with alpha-antagonists cooling depressed the maximal contractile responses. Contractions to the alpha 1-agonist, phenylephrine (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L), were inhibited by cooling, whereas those to the alpha 2-specific agonist B-HT 920 (10(-7)-10(-4) mol/L) showed a pattern similar to that seen with norepinephrine. The data indicate that the human saphenous vein possesses both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors postjunctionally, and that both contribute to contractile responses. Cold augments saphenous vein reactivity to norepinephrine by an apparent increase in the responsiveness of alpha 2-adrenoceptors to agonists. The relationship between temperature and adrenoceptor responsiveness may be of pivotal importance in defining the mechanism of cold-induced vasospasm.",1990,12,1,45-9,10.1067/mva.1990.20311,#3313,Harker 1990,

Sildenafil stimulates the nitric oxide guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway through inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5. The aims of this study were to evaluate in vivo the effect of stimulation of the NO-cGMP pathway on rectal tone, distensibility, and perception in healthy individuals and in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: In eight healthy subjects and four patients with IBS rectal tone, distensibility and perception thresholds were measured with an electronic barostat both before and 60 min after administration of sildenafil (50 mg p.o.). Perception was scored on a graded scale of 0-6. At the end of a distension series an anatomic questionnaire was filled out by the subjects. RESULTS: Sildenafil significantly reduced rectal tone in healthy subjects (intrabag volume predrug: 145.5 +/- 18.7 ml vs postdrug: 164.4 +/- 16.9 ml, p = 0.01) and IBS (111.3 +/- 25.2 ml vs 136.5 +/- 33.3 ml; p = 0.01) but did not alter rectal compliance (healthy subjects: 5.8 +/- 0.4 vs 6.3 +/- 0.6 ml/mm Hg, p > 0.05; IBS subjects: 6.1 +/- 0.6 vs 7.1 +/- 1.0 ml/mm Hg, p > 0.05). Intrabag pressure and rectal wall tension to reach perception thresholds for initial sensation, sensation of stool, and urgency were not altered by sildenafil. However, intrabag volumes to reach these thresholds were significantly increased by sildenafil both in healthy subjects and in patients with IBS. Viscerosomatic referral was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of the NO-cGMP pathway decreases rectal tone but does not influence rectal distensibility. Relaxation of the rectum is accompanied by an increase in rectal volumes to reach perception thresholds in healthy subjects and in patients with IBS, but no direct effect on rectal perception can be demonstrated.",2003,98,10,2253-60,10.1111/j.1572-0241.2003.07661.x,#3314,Fritz 2003,
631,30339273.0,Neuregulin-1 attenuates right ventricular diastolic stiffness in experimental pulmonary hypertension.,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,"We have previously shown that treatment with recombinant human neuregulin-1 (rhNRG-1) improves pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in a monocrotaline (MCT)-induced animal model, by decreasing pulmonary arterial remodelling and endothelial dysfunction, as well as by restoring right ventricular (RV) function. Additionally, rhNRG-1 treatment showed direct myocardial anti-remodelling effects in a model of pressure loading of the RV without PAH. This work aimed to study the intrinsic cardiac effects of rhNRG-1 on experimental PAH and RV pressure overload, and more specifically on diastolic stiffness, at both the ventricular and cardiomyocyte level. We studied the effects of chronic rhNRG-1 treatment on ventricular passive stiffness in RV and LV samples from MCT-induced PAH animals and in the RV from animals with compensated and decompensated RV hypertrophy, through a mild and severe pulmonary artery banding (PAB). We also measured passive tension in isolated cardiomyocytes and quantified the expression of myocardial remodelling-associated genes and calcium handling proteins. Chronic rhNRG-1 treatment decreased passive tension development in RV and LV isolated from animals with MCT-induced PAH. This decrease was associated with increased phospholamban phosphorylation, and with attenuation of the expression of cardiac maladaptive remodelling markers. Finally, we showed that rhNRG-1 therapy decreased RV remodelling and cardiomyocyte passive tension development in PAB-induced RV hypertrophy animals, without compromising cardiac function, pointing to cardiac-specific effects in both hypertrophy stages. In conclusion, we demonstrated that rhNRG-1 treatment decreased RV intrinsic diastolic stiffness, through the improvement of calcium handling and cardiac remodelling signalling.",2019,46,3,255-265,10.1111/1440-1681.13043,#3315,AdÃ£o 2019,diastolic function
632,31119472.0,"Primary unilateral not complicated inguinal hernia with an effective, cheap, less invasive, and easy operation: the Trabucco repair.",Hernia,"BACKGROUND: In modern abdominal wall hernia surgery, the achievement of the most effective tailored repair for each specific defect with the less possible invasiveness, the quicker recovery, the lower costs and the fewer risk of local occurrences, recurrences and chronic pain is the most desirable and cutting-edge goal. METHODS: Since 1989 about 4219 primary unilateral not complicated inguinal hernias have been treated with specific indications with a sutureless and minimally invasive anterior open approach. The great majority of these procedures were performed under local anaesthesia in a day surgery regimen, with a systematic and careful nerve sparing, preservation of cremasteric muscle, and with a 3-5 cm skin incision. RESULTS: The minimally invasive sutureless nerve sparing open approach has shown a very low rate of seromas (0.45%), haematomas (0.24%) and infections (0.07%) while the width of skin incision challenges even laparoscopy. A significant reduction of both postoperative pain (2.7%) and chronic neuralgia (0.047%) has led to excellent outcomes in patients, also in terms of quality of life. Compared to the Lichtenstein's tension-free technique, which is at now the gold standard open treatment for primary inguinal hernia worldwide, there are no significant differences in the observed recurrence rate (well below 1%). CONCLUSION: In our experience of almost 30 years we have been able to experiment and refine more and more the sutureless technique proposed by Trabucco for the treatment of primitive inguinal hernia, peer to peer, improving the local anaesthesia and the ability to detect hidden defects during the repair (Spigelian included), reducing the width of the incisions and tractions on the tissues, introducing the concept of a gentle and bloodless ""finger surgery"" according to a minimally invasive, extremely anatomic, safe, inexpensive, very effective anterior open approach.",2019,23,3,555-560,10.1007/s10029-019-01975-z,#3316,Bruni 2019,Chronic postoperative inguinal pain

During the first three years of follow-up the reconstruction underwent important morphological changes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk of fracture of the reconstructed proximal femur, once the physiological loads are restored, associated with a short, slow but unprotected level walk. Subject-specific finite element models of the operated femur, and of the intact contralateral one, were generated from a computed tomography exam, taken for routine clinical monitoring at month 33 of follow-up. The material properties were mapped on to the mesh and a loading condition comprising the hip joint reaction and the abductor muscle force was simulated. The risk of fracture was locally estimated, for the operated and intact femur, using the ratio between the bone tissue strength and the predicted Von Mises equivalent stress, taking into account the different behaviours of the bone tissue in tension or compression. The results showed that although the fibula grew dramatically during follow-up, the reconstructed femur had not recovered the whole mechanical strength of a normal femur. The reconstructed femoral neck seemed to be weaker than the contralateral one and hence at a higher fracture risk. However, no region reached the failure limit, so the model predicted no fracture of the femur if a short, slow but unprotected walk were allowed. The model predictions found an indirect clinical validation when the child was allowed to perform short unprotected walks and did not experience any fracture.",2003,217,2,111-9,10.1243/09544110360579321,#3317,Taddei 2003,
634,11164180.0,Possible role of bradykinin and angiotensin II in the regulation of penile erection and detumescence.,Urology,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the functional effects of bradykinin (BK) and angiotensin II (AN II) on isolated human cavernous tissue and to detect any changes in the AN II levels in cavernous and peripheral blood samples taken from healthy volunteers at different functional conditions of the penile erectile tissue. Metabolites of the renin-angiotensin system and endothelium-derived vasoactive substances are known to be involved in the regulation of arterial vascular tone. The human corpus cavernosum (HCC), consisting of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, can be regarded as a compartment comparable to the vascular system. METHODS: The relaxing and contracting properties of BK and AN II on isolated HCC were investigated using the organ bath technique. Tissue levels of adenosine-3,5-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and guanosine-3,5-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) were determined using specific radioimmunoassays, after exposing isolated HCC strips in a dose-dependent manner to BK, forskolin, and sodium nitroprusside. Blood samples were drawn simultaneously from the corpus cavernosum and cubital vein of 34 healthy volunteers at stages of penile flaccidity, tumescence, rigidity, and detumescence. Penile erection was induced by audiovisual and tactile stimulation. AN II levels were determined using a radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: In vitro, BK, forskolin, and sodium nitroprusside elicited dose-dependent relaxation of norepinephrine-induced tension of isolated HCC, and AN II evoked dose-dependent contraction of the HCC strips. The relaxing potency of BK was paralleled by its ability to elevate the intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP. In vivo, the AN II levels in the cavernous plasma increased from 21.8 +/- 4.6 pg/mL in the flaccidity phase to 27.9 +/- 10 pg/mL in the detumescence phase. In the peripheral plasma, the AN II levels were 17.2 +/- 6.2 to 19.5 +/- 6.5 pg/mL in the respective penile stages. Thus, the mean AN II levels in the cavernous blood were about 30% higher than in the blood samples taken from the cubital vein. In the cavernous blood, the increase in the AN II plasma levels in the detumescence phase (27.9 +/- 10 pg/mL) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that penile cavernous smooth muscle tone is partially balanced by kinin-induced relaxation and AN II-induced contraction. Since the tissue and plasma levels of both peptides are regulated by the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, there might be a rationale for the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of erectile dysfunction associated with arterial hypertension.",2001,57,1,193-8,10.1016/s0090-4295(00)00881-5,#3318,Becker 2001,
635,28813110.0,Trait vs. state anxiety in different threatening situations.,Trends Psychiatry Psychother,"OBJECTIVE: Anxiety as a uni- or multidimensional construct has been under discussion. The unidimensional approach assumes that there is a general trait anxiety, which predisposes the individuals to increases in state anxiety in various threatening situations. In this case, there should be a correlation between state and trait anxiety in any situation of threat. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between trait and state anxiety in participants exposed to two different anxiogenic situations: interpersonal threat (Video-Monitored Stroop Test - VMST) and physical threat (third molar extraction - TME). METHODS: Participants with various levels of trait anxiety (general trait: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; specific trait: Social Phobia Inventory, Dental Anxiety Scale) had their anxious state evaluated (STAI, self-evaluation of tension level, heart rate, electromyogram activity) before, during and after the VMST or the TME. RESULTS: In VMST, trait anxiety correlated to state anxiety (psychological parameters) in all test phases. However, in TME, the only trait measurement that correlated to state anxiety (psychological parameters) was the Dental Anxiety Scale. CONCLUSION: Trait anxiety correlates positively to state anxiety in situations of interpersonal threat, but not of physical threat.",2017,39,3,147-157,10.1590/2237-6089-2016-0044,#3319,Leal 2017,

637,20709465.0,Mechanical feasibility of immediate mobilization of the brachioradialis muscle after tendon transfer.,J Hand Surg Am,"PURPOSE: Tendon transfer is often used to restore key pinch after cervical spinal cord injury. Current postoperative recommendations include elbow immobilization in a flexed position to protect the brachioradialis-flexor pollicis longus (BR-FPL) repair. The purpose of this study was to measure the BR-FPL tendon tension across a range of wrist and elbow joint angles to determine whether joint motion could cause repair rupture. METHODS: We performed BR-to-FPL tendon transfers on fresh-frozen cadaveric arms (n = 8) and instrumented the BR-FPL tendon with a buckle transducer. Arms were ranged at 4 wrist angles from 45 degrees of flexion to 45 degrees of extension and 8 elbow angles from 90 degrees of flexion to full extension, measuring tension across the BR-FPL repair at each angle. Subsequently, the BR-FPL tendon constructs were removed and elongated to failure. RESULTS: Over a wide wrist and elbow range of motion, BR-FPL tendon tension was under 20 N. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed a significant effect of wrist joint angle (p<.001) and elbow joint angle (p<.001) with significant interaction between elbow and joint angles (p<.001). Because the failure load of the repair site was 203 +/- 19 N, over 10 times the loads that would be expected to occur at the repair site, our results demonstrate that the repair has a safety factor of at least 10. CONCLUSIONS: Our tendon force measurements support the assertion that the elbow joint need not be immobilized when the BR is used as a donor muscle in tendon transfer to the FPL. This is based on the fact that maximum passive tendon tension was only about 20 N in our cadaveric model and the failure strength of this specific repair was over 200 N. We suggest that it is possible to consider performing multiple tendon transfers in a single stage, avoiding immobilization, which may adversely affect functional recovery. These results must be qualified by the fact that issues unique to living tissues such as postoperative edema and tendon gliding cannot be accounted for by this cadaveric model.",2010,35,9,1473-8,10.1016/j.jhsa.2010.06.003,#3321,FridÃ©n 2010,
638,33713861.0,A 3-D human model of complex cardiac arrhythmias.,Acta Biomater,"Cardiac arrhythmias impact over 12 million people globally, with an increasing incidence of acquired arrhythmias. Although animal models have shed light onto fundamental arrhythmic mechanisms, species-specific differences and ethical concerns remain. Current human models using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) either lack the higher order tissue organization of the heart or implement unreliable arrhythmia induction techniques. Our goal was to develop a robust model of acquired arrhythmia by disrupting cardiomyocyte cell-cell signaling - one of the hallmarks of complex arrhythmias. Human 3D microtissues were generated by seeding hydrogel-embedded hiPSC-CMs and cardiac fibroblasts into an established microwell system designed to enable active and passive force assessment. Cell-cell signaling was disrupted using methyl-beta cyclodextrin (MBCD), previously shown to disassemble cardiac gap junctions. We demonstrate that arrhythmias were progressive and present in all microtissues within 5 days of treatment. Arrhythmic tissues exhibited reduced conduction velocity, an increased number of distinct action potentials, and reduced action potential cycle length. Arrhythmic tissues also showed significant reduction in contractile force generation, increased beating frequency, and increased passive tension and collagen deposition, in line with fibrosis. A subset of tissues with more complex arrhythmias exhibited 3D spatial differences in action potential propagation. Pharmacological and electrical defibrillation was successful. Transcriptomic data indicated an enrichment of genes consistent with cardiac arrhythmias. MBCD removal reversed the arrhythmic phenotype, resulting in synchronicity despite not resolving fibrosis. This innovative & reliable human-relevant 3D acquired arrhythmia model shows potential for improving our understanding of arrhythmic action potential conduction and furthering therapeutic development. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes a 3D human model of cardiac arrhythmia-on-a-chip with high reproducibility, fidelity, and extensive functional applicability. To mimic in vivo conditions, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts from healthy controls were combined in a biocompatible fibrin hydrogel and seeded between two deflectable polymeric rods. Using the innate functional properties of this 3D model as well as advanced optical imaging techniques we demonstrated dramatic changes in contraction rate, synchronicity, and electrophysiological conduction in arrhythmic tissues relative to controls. Taken together, these data demonstrate the distinctive potential of this new model for pathophysiological studies, and for arrhythmia drug testing applications.",2021,132,,149-161,10.1016/j.actbio.2021.03.004,#3322,Williams 2021,3D optical mapping
639,22688055.0,Increased smooth muscle contractility in mice deficient for neuropilin 2.,Am J Pathol,"Neuropilins (NRPs) are transmembrane receptors that bind class 3 semaphorins and VEGF family members to regulate axon guidance and angiogenesis. Although expression of NRP1 by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) has been reported, NRP function in smooth muscle (SM) in vivo is unexplored. Using Nrp2(+/LacZ) and Nrp2(+/gfp) transgenic mice, we observed robust and sustained expression of Nrp2 in the SM compartments of the bladder and gut, but no expression in vascular SM, skeletal muscle, or cardiac muscle. This expression pattern was recapitulated in vitro using primary human SM cell lines. Alterations in cell morphology after treatment of primary visceral SMCs with the NRP2 ligand semaphorin-3F (SEMA3F) were accompanied by inhibition of RhoA activity and myosin light chain phosphorylation, as well as decreased cytoskeletal stiffness. Ex vivo contractility testing of bladder muscle strips exposed to electrical stimulation or soluble agonists revealed enhanced tension generation of tissues from mice with constitutive or SM-specific knockout of Nrp2, compared with controls. Mice lacking Nrp2 also displayed increased bladder filling pressures, as assessed by cystometry in conscious mice. Together, these findings identify Nrp2 as a mediator of prorelaxant stimuli in SMCs and suggest a novel function for Nrp2 as a regulator of visceral SM contractility.",2012,181,2,548-59,10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.04.013,#3323,Bielenberg 2012,
640,2942954.0,Developmental and functional adaptation of contractile proteins in cardiac and skeletal muscles.,Physiol Rev,"The goal of this review is to summarize our knowledge of the plasticity of striated muscles in terms of contractile proteins. During development or when the working conditions are changed, the intrinsic physiological properties of both cardiac and skeletal muscles are modified. These modifications generally adapt the muscle to the new environmental requirements. One of the best examples is compensatory overload obtained in fast skeletal muscle by synergistic tenotomy and in a fast ventricle, such as in rats, by aortic banding. In both cases, after a few weeks the initial speed of shortening for the unloaded muscle drops, whereas the maximum tension developed remains unchanged. Heat measurements show that efficiency (i.e., g work/mol ATP) is improved at the fiber level. The fast skeletal muscle becomes slow, fatigue resistant, and then more adapted to endurance. For the ventricle as a whole to become slow is beneficial only if one contraction is considered; however, it is detrimental in terms of cardiac output and leads finally to failure. This adaptational process is partly explained by quantitative and qualitative changes in contractile proteins. Protein synthesis is rapidly enhanced and muscles hypertrophy, which in turn multiplies the contractile units and for the cardiac cylinder normalizes the wall stress. In the meantime the structure and, for myosin, the biological activity of several contractile proteins are modified. These modifications are very unlikely to be posttranscriptional and are in fact explained by several isoform shifts. In both tissues, for example, the expression of the gene coding for a fast myosin (MHCf in skeletal muscle, alpha-MHC in ventricles) is repressed and that of the gene coding for a slow myosin (beta-MHC in both tissues) is stimulated. This is accompanied by a coordinated increase in synthesis of other contractile proteins and, in skeletal muscle only, by isoform shifts of myosin light chains and of the TM-TN regulatory system. Other changes are less well understood. During development it has recently been discovered that three different MHCs (MHCemb, MHCneo, and MHCf) appear sequentially in fast skeletal muscle, which explains, for example, several contradictions of immunological cross-reactions. Currently, however, the functional significance of this finding is unknown, and the well-known decrease of shortening velocity observed in cardiac and skeletal muscles during fetal life is unexplained in terms of contractile proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1986,66,3,710-71,10.1152/physrev.1986.66.3.710,#3324,Swynghedauw 1986,

OBJECTIVE: To explore the working mechanism of manual therapy, we investigated whether 3 cervical spine variables were mediators of the effect of manual therapy on headache frequency. Background Manual therapy has been shown to reduce headache frequency in participants with chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). To what extent specific elements of treatment contribute to the effectiveness of manual therapy in CTTH is unknown. METHODS: One hundred eighty-two participants with CTTH participated in a prospective longitudinal study: 142 underwent manual therapy and 40 participants received usual care by their general practitioner. Regression analysis was performed according to the steps described by Baron and Kenny, and the proportion of mediated effect was estimated for 3 potential mediators: (1) cervical range of motion, (2) neck flexor endurance, and (3) forward head posture. Outcome was defined as a 50% or greater reduction in headache days. RESULTS: Neck flexor endurance mediated 24.5% of the effect of manual therapy. Cervical range of motion and forward head posture showed no mediated effect. CONCLUSIONS: Increased neck flexor endurance appears to be a working mechanism of manual therapy. This finding supports isometric training of neck flexors in participants with CTTH.

Myosin light chains of both chemically skinned and intact samples were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Ca2(+)-sensitivity of ventricular fibers was about 0.14 pCa-units higher than that of atrial fibers in all groups except dilated cardiomyopathy where this difference was markedly diminished (only 0.06 pCa-units). Generally, Ca2(+)-sensitivity of skinned ventricular fibers was the same among the different heart diseases. Skinned atrial fibers from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, however, were significantly (about 0.08 pCa-units) more sensitive for Ca2+ than those of the other groups (coronary heart disease, mitral valve disease or ischemic cardiomyopathy) which showed similar Ca2(+)-tension relationships. Ventricle-specific P-light chain forms could be observed in atrial samples from patients of all groups, whereas no atrium-specific light chain forms were detectable in any ventricular sample. It is concluded that there is no difference in Ca2(+)-sensitivity of the ventricular contractile elements of the human heart in different heart diseases. In atrial myocardium, there is an increased Ca2(+)-sensitivity of skinned fibers from hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy which is probably related to an elevation of right atrial pressure.",1990,22,12,1425-38,10.1016/0022-2828(90)90986-c,#3326,Wankerl 1990,

The system was designed around the AMLAB analog modules and software objects called ICAMs. Each channel consisted of a time and frequency domain block, a torque and angle measurement block, an experiment number counter block and a data storage and retrieval block. The captured data in each channel was used to display and quantify: raw EMG, rectified EMG, smoothed rectified EMG, root-mean-squared EMG, fast Fourier transformed (FFT) EMG, and normalized power spectrum density (NPSD) of EMG. Torque and angle signals representing elbow extension measured by a KIN-COM dynamometer during neural tension testing, as well as signals from an electronic pain threshold marker were interfaced to AMLAB and presented in one integrated display. Although this system has been designed to specifically study the patterns and nature of evoked motor responses during clinical investigation of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients, it could equally well be modified to allow acquisition, processing and analysis of EMG signals in other studies and applications. In this paper, we present for the first time the steps involved in the design, implementation and testing of an integrated AMLAB-based system to study and analyse the mechanically evoked electromyographic, torque and ROM signals and correlate various levels of pain to these signals. We also present samples of resistive torque ROM, and raw and processed EMG recordings during passive elbow extension.",2003,26,2,70-8,,#3327,Jaberzadeh 2003,
644,31325687.0,High tension electrocution death: New histopathological cardiac tools by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope.,J Forensic Leg Med,"In deaths due to electrocution intraepidermal separation, vacuolation of epidermal cells, ""swiss cheese"" aspect of the superficial part of epidermis (swollen and with multiple vescicles), metallization, necrosis of collagenous fibers, cardiomyocytes alterations are microscopically described. No cardiac nerve damage due to electricity is actually reported in literature. In this work we tried to find new morphological signs in the hearts of deaths due to electrocution. In three cases of deaths due to electrocution, in which forensic autopsies were performed within 36 h of the death, heart specimens were taken at the level of common trunk of the left coronary artery. The myocardium histological examination at optical microscope and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) revealed fragmentation of cardiomyocytes, nerve trunks damage with hydropic swelling of the nerve fibers, interstitial and sub-nerve-sheath edema, very dishomogenous distribution of the natural fluorescence of the neurofilaments, coarctation of epicardial gangliar cells with cytoplasmic cleft and irregular fluorescence pattern. Identification of S-100 protein by immunohistochemistry can help to better observe the hydropic swelling of the nerve fibers and the central cytoplasmic clefts. These alterations could be used in future as specific signs of the passage of the electrical current through the heart. We recommend heart specimens at the level of common trunk of the left coronary artery in all the cases of suspected electrocution, to better evaluate cardiac nerve trunks damages and alterations.",2019,66,,162-166,10.1016/j.jflm.2019.07.005,#3328,DeDonno 2019,Cardiac nerves
645,9375582.0,Actions of C-type natriuretic peptide and sodium nitroprusside on carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate formation and contraction in ciliary and iris sphincter smooth muscles.,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,"PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) accumulation and on carbachol (CCh)-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) production and contraction in ciliary muscle (CM) and iris sphincter (Sph) isolated from bovine and other mammalian species. METHODS: Ciliary muscle and sphincter isolated from cows, cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, and humans were used. Bovine specimens were used in the present work. Accumulation of cGMP and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in tissue extracts was measured by radioimmunoassay, IP3 production was measured by ion-exchange chromatography, and changes in tension were recorded isometrically. RESULTS: In general, CNP and SNP exerted differential inhibitory effects on muscarinic-receptor-induced responses in CM and Sph isolated from the various species. Thus in bovine CM, SNP stimulated cGMP formation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and dose dependently inhibited CCh-induced IP3 production and contraction. These effects were inhibited by LY 83583, a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, and mimicked by 8-Br-cGMP, a cell-membrane permeable analogue of cGMP. The inhibitory effects of the soluble cGMP analogue are tissue and species specific. Sodium nitroprusside had no effect on the muscarinic responses in bovine Sph, but it attenuated CCh-induced contractions in Sph isolated from cats, dogs, and rabbits. In bovine Sph, CNP increased cGMP accumulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner and dose dependently inhibited CCh-induced IP3 production and contraction. LY 83583 had no effect on the muscarinic responses. C-type natriuretic peptide attenuated CCh-induced contraction in CM isolated from monkey and human, but it had no influence on this response in CM isolated from cows, cats, and dogs. CONCLUSIONS: In bovine CM, SNP effects are probably mediated through soluble guanylyl cyclase, whereas in Sph the CNP effects are mediated through membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase, which is associated with the type-B natriuretic peptide receptor. Agents that strongly increase intracellular cGMP levels, including SNP and CNP, produce significant inhibition of CCh-induced IP3 production and contraction. These effects are tissue and species specific. The results indicate that the cGMP signaling system, similar to the cAMP system, has a major inhibitory influence on the muscarinic responses in smooth muscles of the iris-ciliary body. The agents CNP and SNP, which stimulate cGMP accumulation in the ocular smooth muscles, could reduce intraocular pressure, presumably by increasing uveoscleral outflow induced by relaxation of the CM. However, the relationships between the CNP- and SNP-induced inhibition of the muscarinic stimulation and the reported intraocular pressure-lowering effects of the cGMP-elevating agents remain to be determined.",1997,38,12,2629-38,,#3329,Ding 1997,
646,11456347.0,Psychophysiological reactions in dental phobic patients during video stimulation.,Eur J Oral Sci,"Electromyography (EMG) reflecting forehead muscle tension, heart rate (HR) and skin conductance (SC) were continuously recorded in dental phobic subjects (n = 126) and controls (n = 25) during exposure of dental and neutral video scenes in order to explore the relationship between dental fear and psychophysiological responses. This relationship is far from well established, and the present investigation was performed to contribute to the understanding of the psychophysiology of dental fear. Dental phobics had a mean anxiety level of 17.3 as measured by Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) and refused conventional dental treatment. Control subjects reported regular dental treatment and a DAS score below population average (DAS < 8). Psychophysiological data was reduced to level (mean) and reactivity (means of intraindividual variations). Results showed that physiologic reactions to fear-relevant conditions measured by HR and EMG reflected degree of dental fear, and that neutral conditions, when presented for the second and third time, induced lower psychophysiologic reactions in phobics than in controls. Recordings of SC indicated that dental phobics may differ from individuals suffering from other types of specific phobia by showing weakened autonomic responsiveness to threat.",2001,109,3,172-7,10.1034/j.1600-0722.2001.00985.x,#3330,Lundgren 2001,
647,31008478.0,Multiple regulatory effects of angiotensin II on the large-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated potassium channel in vascular smooth muscle cells.,Sheng Li Xue Bao,"Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) tension. Angiotensin II (Ang II) as the main effector molecule of RAS can increase the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration and cause VSMCs contraction by activating angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The large-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channel is an essential potassium channel in VSMCs, playing an important role in maintaining membrane potential and intracellular potassium-calcium balance. The BK channel in VSMCs mainly consists of α and β1 subunits. Functional BKα subunits contain voltage-sensors and Ca(2+) binding sites. Hence, increase in the membrane potential or intracellular Ca(2+) concentration can trigger the opening of the BK channel by mediating transient K(+) outward current in a negative regulatory manner. However, increasing evidence has shown that although Ang II can raise the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, it also inhibits the expression and function of the BK channel by activating the PKC pathway, internalizing AT1R-BKα heterodimer, or dissociating α and β1 subunits. Under some specific conditions, Ang II can also activate the BK channel, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this review, we summarize the potential mechanisms underlying the inhibitory or activating effect of Ang II on the BK channel, hoping that it could provide a theoretical basis for improving intracellular ion imbalance.",2019,71,2,187-195,,#3331,Yin 2019,
648,7389221.0,Comparison of myocardial oxygen consumption indices in man.,Clin Cardiol,"Hemodynamic indices of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) were examined in 13 patients with coronary heart disease. The specific aim of this study was to investigate whether clinical results agree with experimental findings in animals. During hemodynamic and respiratory steady-state conditions at rest, the MVO2 (7.6-14.2 ml/min/100 g) was measured directly by myocardial blood flow (argon method) and arterio-coronary venous oxygen content difference. MVO2 was compared with five indirect indices of MVO2. A complex additive parameter consisting of five components of MVO2 had the highest correlation with MVO2 (r = 0.97), as was also demonstrated in a recent experimental study at maximum changes in hemodynamics and MVO2. More easily measurable predictors of MVO2 such as tension-time index (r = 0.923), product of mean systolic aortic pressure and square root of heart rate (r = 0.928), pressure rate product (r = 0.915), and triple product (r = 0.941) were less closely correlated with MVO2. The lower correlations of the readily obtainable indices of MVO2 are probably related to their failure to incorporate factors such as contractility and ventricular dimensions, which are known to exert an important influence on MVO2. The excellent correlation of the hemodynamic additive parameter with MVO2 supports the theoretical concept and the implications of the experimental study. The accurate prediction of MVO2 is based on adequate measurement of MVO2 for the velocity of tension development and maintenance of tension during systolic ejection period, both of which are integrated in the additive index.",1980,3,2,116-22,,#3332,Baller 1980,

We hypothesized that there would be a greater muscle length-specific effect of CRS vs SS. Isometric hamstring strength was measured in 20 healthy people at four knee joint angles (90°, 70°, 50°, 30°) before and after stretching. One leg received SS, the contralateral received CRS. Both stretching techniques resulted in significant strength loss, which was most apparent at short muscle lengths [SS: P = 0.025; stretching × angle P < 0.001; 11.7% at 90° P < 0.01; 5.6% at 70° nonsignificant (ns); 1.3% at 50° ns; -3.7% at 30° ns. CRS: P < 0.001; stretching × angle P < 0.001; 17.7% at 90°, 13.4% at 70°, 11.4% at 50°, all P < 0.01, 4.3% at 30° ns]. The overall stretch-induced strength loss was greater (P = 0.015) after CRS (11.7%) vs SS (3.7%). The muscle length effect on strength loss was not different between CRS and SS (stretching × angle × stretching technique P = 0.43). Contrary to the hypothesis, CRS did not result in a greater shift in the length-tension relationship, and in fact, resulted in greater overall strength loss compared with SS. These results support the use of SS for stretching the hamstrings.",2015,25,6,764-9,10.1111/sms.12399,#3333,Balle 2015,Stretch-induced strength loss

METHODS: This observational prospective study included subjects undergoing weaning from mechanical ventilation. The performance of the indices was evaluated by calculation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves. The areas under the curve were compared using the Hanley and McNeil method. P values<.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: Seventy-two subjects (57±20 y old) were selected for the study. Forty-three subjects were weaned, and 21 died during the study period. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 22.3±19.4 d. The areas under the curve of 5 weaning predictors (TIE index, integrative weaning index, noninvasive tension-time index, maximum inspiratory pressure, and breathing frequency/tidal volume index) were significantly higher than those of the other indices. The TIE index had the largest area under the curve (0.96±0.02) in comparison with the integrative weaning index (0.82±0.05, P=.009), noninvasive tension-time index (0.80±0.05, P=.001), maximum inspiratory pressure (0.77±0.06, P=.001), and breathing frequency/tidal volume index (0.72±0.06, P=.001).

651,20086288.0,Strategies for treatment of gait and posture associated deficits in movement disorders: the impact of deep brain stimulation.,Restor Neurol Neurosci,"Gait difficulties occur early in the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as in generalized dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment for patients with PD or dystonia. PD-associated slowness of gait improves dramatically after this procedure. Since not all gait problems can be treated with DBS, it is mandatory to assess the patient's symptoms precisely before an operation can be considered. In advanced stages of PD, postural deficits causing frequent falls are a major concern and will necessitate other strategies. In dystonia, walking may become possible only after this surgical intervention. After the implantation of DBS electrodes, rehabilitative treatment is necessary to (i) to establish new movement patterns, (ii) preserve an appropriate activity level, and (iii) treat specific disability, which resulted from secondary changes of the musculoskeletal system during pathological muscle tension in dystonia.

652,22607581.0,Head pain referral during examination of the neck in migraine and tension-type headache.,Headache,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate if and to what extent typical head pain can be reproduced in tension-type headache (TTH), migraine without aura sufferers, and controls when sustained pressure was applied to the lateral posterior arch of C1 and the articular pillar of C2, stressing the atlantooccipital and C2-3 segments respectively. BACKGROUND: Occipital and neck symptoms often accompany primary headache, suggesting involvement of cervical afferents in central pain processing mechanisms in these disorders. Referral of head pain from upper cervical structures is made possible by convergence of cervical and trigeminal nociceptive afferent information in the trigemino-cervical nucleus. Upper cervical segmental and C2-3 zygapophysial joint dysfunction is recognized as a potential source of noxious afferent information and is present in primary headache sufferers. Furthermore, referral of head pain has been demonstrated from symptomatic upper cervical segments and the C2-3 zygapophysial joints, suggesting that head pain referral may be a characteristic of cervical afferent involvement in headache. METHODS: Thirty-four headache sufferers and 14 controls were examined interictally. Headache patients were diagnosed according the criteria of the International Headache Society and comprised 20 migraine without aura (females n = 18; males n = 2; average age 35.3 years) and 14 TTH sufferers (females n = 11; males n = 3; average age 30.7 years). Two techniques were used specifically to stress the atlantooccipital segments (Technique 1 - C1) and C2-3 zygapophysial joints (Technique 2 - C2). Two techniques were also applied to the arm--the common extensor origin and the mid belly of the biceps brachii. Participants reported reproduction of head pain with ""yes"" or ""no"" and rated the intensity of head pain and local pressure of application on a scale of 0 -10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = intolerable pain. RESULTS: None of the subjects reported head pain during application of techniques on the arm. Head pain referral during the cervical examination was reported by 8 of 14 (57%) control participants, all TTH patients and all but 1 migraineur (P < .002). In each case, participants reported that the referred head pain was similar to the pain they usually experienced during TTH or migraine. The frequency of head pain referral was identical for Techniques 1 and 2. The intensity of referral did not differ between Technique 1 and Technique 2 or between groups. Tenderness ratings to thumb pressure were comparable between the Techniques 1 and 2 when pressure was applied to C1 and C2 respectively and across groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences for tenderness ratings to thumb pressure between Technique 1 and Technique 2 on the arm or between groups. While tenderness ratings to thumb pressure for Technique 2 were similar for both referral (n = 41) and non-referral (n = 7) groups, tenderness ratings for Technique 1 in the referral group were significantly greater when compared with the non-referral group (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the continuum concept of headache, one in which noxious cervical afferent information may well be significantly underestimated. The high incidence of reproduction of headache supports the evaluation of musculoskeletal features in patients presenting with migrainous and TTH symptoms. This, in turn, may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of headache and developing alternative treatment options.",2012,52,8,1226-35,10.1111/j.1526-4610.2012.02169.x,#3336,Watson 2012,
653,2282458.0,Inhibitory role of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in rat and human pulmonary arteries.,Br J Pharmacol,"1. The inhibitory role of endothelium-derived relaxing factor was studied in both rat and human pulmonary arteries in vitro by inhibiting its synthesis with the L-arginine analogue NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). 2. In rat pulmonary arteries, L-NMMA pretreatment (10-300 microM) dose-dependently inhibited acetylcholine-induced relaxation (which is endothelium-dependent). NG-monomethyl-D-arginine (D-NMMA, 100 microM) was without effect. L-Arginine, but not D-arginine, dose-dependently reversed this inhibition. L-NMMA had no effect on relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside. 3. In human small pulmonary arteries L-NMMA (100 microM) pretreatment similarly inhibited the acetylcholine-induced relaxation but had no effect on the sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation. 4. In both rat and human pulmonary arteries, L-NMMA, but not D-NMMA, always caused contraction of preconstricted tissues whereas it had no effect on baseline tone. In the rat this contraction was completely prevented by prior treatment with L-arginine. 5. L-NMMA (100 microM) pretreatment mimicked the effect of endothelium removal on phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction, both resulting in an increase in tension development at each concentration of phenylephrine. This enhancement was greatest at low concentrations of phenylephrine but was still present even at the highest concentrations. Pretreatment with L-NMMA (100 microM) also significantly increased the responses to single doses of phenylephrine. 6. These results suggest that endothelium-derived relaxing factor from endothelial cells both mediates the relaxation response to acetylcholine and also acts as a physiological brake against vasoconstriction in pulmonary vessels.",1990,101,1,166-70,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1990.tb12107.x,#3337,Crawley 1990,
654,28328100.0,Smart mechanosensing machineries enable migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis-relevant 3D matrices.,Cell Biol Int,"At the early stage of atherosclerosis, neointima is formed due to the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from the media to the intima. VSMCs are surrounded by highly adhesive 3D matrices. They take specific strategies to cross various 3D matrices in the media, including heterogeneous collagen and mechanically strong basement membrane. Migration of VSMCs is potentially caused by biomechanical mechanism. Most in vitro studies focus on cell migration on 2D substrates in response to biochemical factors. How the cells move through 3D matrices under the action of mechanosensing machineries remains unexplored. In this review, we propose that several interesting tension-dependent machineries act as ""tractor""-posterior myosin II accumulation, and ""wrecker""-anterior podosome maintaining, to power VSMCs ahead. VSMCs embedded in 3D matrices may accumulate a minor myosin II isoform, myosin IIB, at the cell rear. Anisotropic myosin IIB distribution creates cell rear, polarizes cell body, pushes the nucleus and reshapes the cell body, and cooperates with a uniformly distributed myosin IIA to propel the cell forward. On the other hand, matrix digestion by podosome further promote the migration when the matrix becomes denser. Actomyosin tension activates Src to induce podosome in soft 3D matrices and retain the podosome integrity to steadily digest the matrix.",2017,41,6,586-598,10.1002/cbin.10764,#3338,Chi 2017,actomyosin tension

A numerical study.,J Craniomaxillofac Surg,"The objective of this study was to compare the load transfer mechanism and behavior of two total temporomandibular joint (TMJ) prostheses: Biomet and Christensen TMJ models were simulated. Computed tomography (CT) images from a specific patient were used to generate two models for use in simulation of implantation for the total temporomandibular prostheses. Three finite element models were created in all. One considered the intact temporomandibular joint and two received a temporomandibular implant. In the simulation we considered the five most important muscles acting on the mandible and incisor teeth support. The Christensen model reduced strain in the opposite condyle by around 50% while increasing strain in the implanted condyle. The changes in the posterior side of the implanted condyle present an increase of five times the minimum principal strain, suggesting some bone fatigue. With the Biomet implant, the reduction in strain in the implanted condyle on the posterior side was around 100%, suggesting the possibility of some bone loss proximally near the resection plane. Based on our results, we conclude that in both models the implants influence the behavior of the mandible by improving the symmetry of the mandible and strain distribution. The Biomet implant modifies the behavior of the mandible slightly and presents some improvements over the Christensen TMJ model in strain distribution and tensions in the opposite intact disc similar to the non-implanted situation.",2015,43,8,1398-403,10.1016/j.jcms.2015.07.009,#3339,Ramos 2015,Articular disc
656,25531582.0,A novel role for RhoA GTPase in the regulation of airway smooth muscle contraction.,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,"Recent studies have demonstrated a novel molecular mechanism for the regulation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction by RhoA GTPase. In ASM tissues, both myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and actin polymerization are required for active tension generation. RhoA inactivation dramatically suppresses agonist-induced tension development and completely inhibits agonist-induced actin polymerization, but only slightly reduces MLC phosphorylation. The inhibition of MLC phosphatase does not reverse the effects of RhoA inactivation on contraction or actin polymerization. Thus, RhoA regulates ASM contraction through its effects on actin polymerization rather than MLC phosphorylation. Contractile stimulation of ASM induces the recruitment and assembly of paxillin, vinculin, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) into membrane adhesion complexes (adhesomes) that regulate actin polymerization by catalyzing the activation of cdc42 GTPase by the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting target (GIT) - p21-activated kinase (PAK) - PAK-interacting exchange factor (PIX) complex. Cdc42 is a necessary and specific activator of the actin filament nucleation activator, N-WASp. The recruitment and activation of paxillin, vinculin, and FAK is prevented by RhoA inactivation, thus preventing cdc42 and N-WASp activation. We conclude that RhoA regulates ASM contraction by catalyzing the assembly and activation of membrane adhesome signaling modules that regulate actin polymerization, and that the RhoA-mediated assembly of adhesome complexes is a fundamental step in the signal transduction process in response to a contractile agonist.",2015,93,2,129-36,10.1139/cjpp-2014-0388,#3340,Zhang 2015,actin polymerization
657,11726622.0,Mechanisms of action of unoprostone on trabecular meshwork contractility.,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,"PURPOSE: This study was performed to clarify the possible mechanism behind the ocular hypotensive effect of unoprostone isopropyl (Rescula; Novartis Ophthalmics AG, Basel, Switzerland), a new docosanoid that has been shown to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. To gain insight into the possible mode of action, the effects of unoprostone on ciliary muscle (CM) and trabecular meshwork (TM) contractility, intracellular calcium levels, and membrane channels were investigated. METHODS: The effects of unoprostone (M1 metabolite = free acid, 10(-5) M) and endothelin (ET)-1 (10(-9) M) on bovine TM (BTM) and ciliary muscle (CM) strips were investigated, by using a custom-made force-length transducer system. The effects of unoprostone and ET-1 (5 x 10(-8) M) on intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in cultured human TM (HTM) were measured using fura-2AM as a fluorescent probe. Patch-clamp experiments were performed on HTM and BTM cells to investigate the unoprostone-dependent modulation of membrane currents. RESULTS: In isolated TM and CM strips, unoprostone almost completely inhibited ET-induced contractions (TM: 2.9% +/- 4.3% vs. 19.6% +/- 5.7%, P < 0.05, n = 6; CM: 1.4% +/- 1.6% vs. 30.1% +/- 5.3%, P < 0.01, n = 6; 100% = maximal carbachol-induced (10(-6) M) contraction). However, neither carbachol-induced contraction nor baseline tension was affected by unoprostone. Furthermore, unoprostone had no effect on baseline intracellular calcium levels (baseline: 126 +/- 45 nM versus unoprostone: 132 +/- 42 nM, n = 8) in HTM cells. The endothelin-induced increase (679 +/- 102 nM), however, was almost completely (P < 0.01) blocked by unoprostone (178 +/- 40 nM). In patch-clamp recordings, unoprostone could be shown to double the amplitude of outward current (HTM: 200% +/- 33%; n = 6; BTM: 179% +/- 20%; n = 8). This effect was blocked by the specific inhibitor of maxi-K channels, iberiotoxin. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents evidence for direct interaction of unoprostone with the contractility of the TM and CM. This compound may lower IOP by affecting aqueous outflow, most probably conventional outflow pathways (i.e., TM) through inhibition of ET-dependent mechanisms. In addition, unoprostone interacts with the maxi-K channel. Although primarily Ca(2+)-sensitive signal-transduction pathways seem to be involved, effects of unoprostone on Ca(2+)-independent pathways and uveoscleral outflow cannot be excluded.",2001,42,13,3193-201,,#3341,Thieme 2001,
658,23274888.0,Metabolic signatures of human adipose tissue hypoxia in obesity.,Diabetes,"Adipose tissue (AT) hypoxia has been proposed as the cause of obesity-related AT dysfunction, moving the tissue toward a proinflammatory phenotype. In humans, AT oxygenation has been assessed by expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes or direct assessment of O₂ tension; the obvious read out of hypoxia, effects on intermediary metabolism, has not been investigated. We used tissue-specific venous catheterization of subcutaneous abdominal AT in humans to investigate oxygen-related metabolic processes, searching for metabolic signatures relating to hypoxia in obesity. O₂ delivery to AT was reduced in obesity (P < 0.05). However, O₂ consumption was low (<30% of resting forearm skeletal muscle [SM], P < 0.001); this was not related to obesity. AT primarily oxidized glucose, as demonstrated by a respiratory quotient close to 1.0 (higher than SM, P < 0.05). AT was a net producer of lactate, but there was an inverse relationship in venous outflow between lactate-to-pyruvate ratio (a marker of cytosolic redox state) and BMI, suggesting that AT is glycolytic but obese AT is not hypoxic. Although delivery of O₂ to the obese AT is reduced, O₂ consumption is low, and metabolic signatures of human AT do not support the notion of a hypoxic state in obesity.",2013,62,5,1417-25,10.2337/db12-1032,#3342,Hodson 2013,
659,15072915.0,Role of ATP-sensitive K+ channels in relaxation of penile resistance arteries.,Urology,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the functional presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K+) channels (K(ATP)) in penile resistance arteries by evaluating the relaxant effects of the selective K(ATP) channel openers, cromakalim and levcromakalim, and also the involvement of K(ATP) channels in the relaxation of two drugs currently used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ie, prostaglandin E1 [PGE1] and sildenafil). METHODS: Penile resistance arteries were dissected from the horse corpus cavernosum and mounted in microvascular myographs for isometric tension recording. The arteries were precontracted with phenylephrine, and the responses to several vasodilators were tested in the absence and presence of K+ channel blockers. RESULTS: Cromakalim and levcromakalim evoked complete concentration-dependent relaxations that were blocked by 3 microm of the selective K(ATP) channel inhibitor glibenclamide. Raising extracellular K+ (25 mM) inhibited the relaxations to PGE1 and to the selective inhibitor of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4) rolipram. At a concentration selective for calcium-activated K+(K(Ca)) channels (3 mM), tetraethylammonium inhibited rolipram responses but not those of PGE1. However, glibenclamide significantly reduced the relaxation to both PGE1 and rolipram, but not those induced by the selective inhibitor of the type 5 cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5). CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest a functional role for K(ATP) channels in the relaxation of penile resistance arteries, as well as their differential involvement in the vasodilation to drugs used in the treatment of organic erectile dysfunction.

To determine the specific functional effects of these phosphorylation sites (Ser-43, Ser-45, and Thr-144), we measured tension and sliding speed of thin filaments in reconstituted preparations in which endogenous cTnI was replaced with cTnI phosphorylated by protein kinase C-epsilon or mutated to cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, cTnI-S43E/S45E, or cTnI-T144E. We used detergent-skinned mouse cardiac fiber bundles to measure changes in Ca(2+)-dependence of force. Compared with controls, fibers reconstituted with phosphorylated cTnI, cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E, or cTnI-S43E/S45E were desensitized to Ca(2+), and maximum tension was as much as 27% lower, whereas fibers reconstituted with cTnI-T144E showed no change. In the in vitro motility assay actin filaments regulated by troponin complexes containing phosphorylated cTnI or cTnI-S43E/S45E/T144E showed both a decrease in Ca(2+) sensitivity and maximum sliding speed compared with controls, whereas filaments regulated by cTnI-S43E/S45E showed only decreased maximum sliding speed and filaments regulated by cTnI-T144E demonstrated only desensitization to Ca(2+). Our results demonstrate novel site specificity of effects of PKC phosphorylation on cTnI function and emphasize the complexity of modulation of the actin-myosin interaction by specific changes in the thin filament.",2003,278,13,11265-72,10.1074/jbc.M210712200,#3344,Burkart 2003,
661,13679302.0,Beneficial effects of GH/IGF-1 on skeletal muscle atrophy and function in experimental heart failure.,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,"Muscle atrophy is a determinant of exercise capacity in heart failure (CHF). Myocyte apoptosis, triggered by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or its second messenger sphingosine (SPH), is one of the causes of atrophy. Growth hormone (GH) improves hemodynamic and cardiac trophism in several experimental models of CHF, but its effect on skeletal muscle in CHF is not yet clear. We tested the hypothesis that GH can prevent skeletal muscle apoptosis in rats with CHF. CHF was induced by injecting monocrotaline. After 2 wk, 2 groups of rats were treated with GH (0.2 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) and 1.0 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) subcutaneously. A third group of controls had saline. After 2 additional weeks, rats were killed. Tibialis anterior cross-sectional area, myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition, and a study on myocyte apoptosis and serum levels of TNF-alpha and SPH were carried out. The number of apoptotic nuclei, muscle atrophy, and serum levels of TNF-alpha and SPH were decreased with GH at high but not at low doses compared with CHF rats. Bcl-2 was increased, whereas activated caspases and bax were decreased. The MHC pattern in GH-treated animals was similar to that of controls. Monocrotaline slowed down both contraction and relaxation but did not affect specific tetanic force, whereas absolute force was decreased. GH treatment restored contraction and relaxation to control values and brought muscle mass and absolute twitch and tetanic tension to normal levels. These findings may provide an insight into the therapeutic strategy of GH given to patients with CHF to improve exercise capacity.",2004,286,1,C138-44,10.1152/ajpcell.00114.2003,#3345,DallaLibera 2004,
662,17324748.0,Knockout mice reveal that the angiotensin II type 1B receptor links to smooth muscle contraction.,Am J Hypertens,"BACKGROUND: Rodents express two isoforms of the angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor: AT(1A) and AT(1B). It is unclear which receptor subtype mediates contraction in response to angiotensin II in various arteries. We tested the hypothesis that the AT(1B) receptor is the predominant receptor that mediates contraction in the abdominal aorta in response to angiotensin II. METHODS: Isometric tension responses to angiotensin II were determined in abdominal aortic rings obtained from male wild-type and AT(1B) receptor knockout mice. The rings were suspended in an organ bath of a wire myograph and contractions to angiotensin II and other vasoconstrictors were determined. RESULTS: Angiotensin II contracted aortic segments from wild-type mice; however, this response was virtually absent in rings obtained from AT(1B) receptor knockout mice. Contractions in response to K(+) and U46619 (thromboxane A(2) mimetic) were not different between rings obtained from wild-type and AT(1B) receptor knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced angiotensin II contraction is not related to a generalized decrease in smooth muscle function, rather it is specifically due to genetic ablation of the AT(1B) receptor. Our data support the concept that AT(1B) receptors couple to contraction in the mouse abdominal aorta, a function that parallels the single known AT(1) receptor in human vascular smooth muscle.",2007,20,3,335-7,10.1016/j.amjhyper.2006.09.007,#3346,SwaffordANJr 2007,
663,16515774.0,Effects of NO on mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes: Pathophysiological relevance.,Cardiovasc Res,"Although the specific roles of nitric oxide (NO) in the heart in general and on cardiac mitochondria in particular remain controversial, it is now clear that both endogenous and exogenous sources of NO exert important modulatory effects on mitochondrial function. There is also growing evidence that NO can be produced within the mitochondria themselves. NO can influence respiratory activity, both through direct effects on the respiratory chain or indirectly via modulation of mitochondrial calcium accumulation. At pathological concentrations, NO can cause irreversible alterations in respiratory function and can also interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS) to form reactive nitrogen species, which may further impair mitochondrial respiration and can even lead to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and cell death. Diabetes, aging, myocardial ischemia, and heart failure have all been associated with altered ROS generation, which can alter the delicate regulatory balance of effects of NO in the mitochondria. As NO competes with oxygen at cytochrome oxidase, it can be argued that experiments exploring the roles of NO on mitochondrial respiration should be performed at physiological (i.e. relatively low) oxygen tensions. Improvements in techniques, and a gradual appreciation of the many potential pitfalls in studying mitochondrial NO, are leading to a recognition of the role of NO in the regulation of mitochondrial function in the heart in health and disease.",2006,71,1,21-Oct,10.1016/j.cardiores.2006.01.019,#3347,Davidson 2006,
664,6794096.0,The actions of prostaglandins and cyclo-oxygenase inhibition on the resistance vessels supplying the human fetal placenta.,Prostaglandins,"The resistance arteries supplying individual exchange villi of the full-term human fetal placenta were examined for their reactivity to various prostaglandins (PG's) as well as for their ability to synthesize biologically active PG's. PGA1, PGF2 alpha, PGE2 and PGE1 produced dose-dependent contractions between 10(-7) and 10(-5)M. The order of potency observed was PGA1 approximately PGF2 alpha greater than PGE2 greater than PGE1. TXB2 was without activity in this preparation. Prostacyclin (PGI2) produced a dose-dependent relaxation of pre-contracted strips between 10(-8)M and 10(-5)M. Arachidonic acid (A.A.) produced stable dose-dependent contractions (10(-5) M to 10(-3)M) which were totally abolished by pretreatment with 10(-7)M meclofenamate (MF). At no concentration of A.A. was any evidence of vascular relaxation observed. Larger concentrations of MF (greater than 10(-6)M) resulted in a non-specific depression of the placental vascular smooth muscle. Meclofenamate (10(-7)M) pretreatment of strips subjected to dose-response studies using PGF2 alpha, PGE2, bradykinin (B K) and angiotensin II (AII) revealed a significant reduction in tension developed to both BK and AII. This finding suggests that the vasoactive peptides BK and AII stimulate the synthesis of vasoconstricting PG's in the fetal placental resistance arteries which relax in response to PGI2 and contract in response to the other PG's tested.",1981,21,6,1033-43,10.1016/0090-6980(81)90171-4,#3349,Tulenko 1981,
665,4023976.0,Airway responsiveness to histamine in man: effect of atropine on in vivo and in vitro comparison.,Thorax,"Airway responsiveness to histamine in man may be determined by the smooth muscle sensitivity to histamine or to the interaction between vagal nerve input and smooth muscle sensitivity. We have compared in vivo responsiveness to histamine with in vitro smooth muscle sensitivity to histamine in 20 non-asthmatic patients and one asthmatic patient undergoing thoracic surgery. Histamine responsiveness was assessed in the first 10 non-asthmatics without atropine pretreatment, in the second 10 after atropine pretreatment, and in the asthmatic patient both with and without atropine. In vivo responsiveness was also measured in 10 normal subjects and 10 asthmatic patients not undergoing surgery. Results were expressed as the provocation concentration (PC) causing a decrease in FEV1 of 20% (PC20FEV1) and in specific airways conductance of 35% (PC35SGaw), and in terms of maximal expiratory flow at 35% vital capacity, measured from the partial (V35(P] and complete (V35(C] flow volume curves of 35% (PC35V35(P); PC35V35(C]. In vitro smooth muscle sensitivity to histamine of bronchial tissue obtained at thoracotomy was expressed as the concentration causing a 50% maximum contraction (EC50) and as the maximum tension generated. There was considerable variation between patients in the in vivo responsiveness but a relatively narrow range for in vitro responses. There was no significant correlation between in vivo responsiveness, either with or without atropine pretreatment, and in vitro results. The asthmatic patient showed hyperresponsiveness in vivo but but not in vitro. These results suggest that in vitro airway smooth muscle sensitivity to histamine is not the sole determinant of in vivo airway responsiveness and that this lack of relationship is not explained by the influence of vagal nerve input on in vivo measurements. The results in the asthmatic patient suggest that airway hyperresponsiveness may be an in vivo phenomenon which is not related to a primary abnormality of airway smooth muscle.",1985,40,4,261-7,10.1136/thx.40.4.261,#3350,Roberts 1985,

Other possible effects are improved ventilatory muscle function and desensitization to dyspnea. We compared general physical training (GPT), consisting of walking and stair climbing exercises, with inspiratory muscle training (IMT), consisting of targeted breathing through inspiratory resistances, in two groups with severe COPD. Seven subjects; age 60 (8) years, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 0.84 (0.35) L, arterial oxygen tension (PaO(2)) 11.1 (0.8) kPa, arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO(2)) 4.9 (0.3) kPa, had GPT and nine subjects; age 60 (9) years, FEV(1) 0.83 (0.31) L, PaO(2) 10.4 (0.8) kPa, PaCO(2) 4.4 (0.5) kPa had IMT. Each group trained daily for 30 minutes for eight weeks and 70% of the sessions were supervised. Six minute walking distance increased in both groups: 32 m (6.9% P < 0.05) with GPT and 23 m (4.8%; P < 0.05) with IMT but significant improvements in symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise performance were not detected. Breathlessness by visual analog scale was reduced following 6-minute walks after GPT (P < 0.05) but not after IMT. Following maximal incremental tests, breathlessness scores were unchanged for both groups.

667,15378277.0,Anatomical and biomechanical investigations of the iliotibial tract.,Surg Radiol Anat,"Divergent descriptions of the anatomic location and biomechanical function of the iliotibial tract (IT) can be found in the literature. This study attempted to obtain exact data regarding the anatomic course and material characteristics including the biomechanical properties of this structure. The following were its aims: (1) anatomical investigations of the IT; (2) mechanical properties of the IT; (3) femoral head centralizing force of the IT and subligamentous forces in the height of the greater trochanter in different joint positions by using a custom-made measuring prosthesis and a subligamentous positioned sensor; (4) construction of a finite element model of the proximal femur including the IT and measuring the femoral neck angle under variation. The hip joints and IT in a total of 18 unfixed corpses were evaluated. We studied the anatomic relationship to surrounding structures, as well as the material properties with the help of tensile strength testing utilizing an uniaxial apparatus. During the test, a load-displacement curve was registered, documenting the maximum load and deformation of the IT. To measure the subligamentous pressure at the height of the greater trochanter, a custom-made sensor with a power-recording instrument was constructed. Furthermore, an altered hip prosthesis with a pressure gauge at the height of the femoral neck was used to measure the forces which are directed at the acetabulum. The investigations were done in neutral-0 position and ab/adduction of the hip joint of the unfixed corpse. In addition, we varied the femoral neck angle between 115 degrees and 155 degrees in 5 degrees steps. To confirm the subligamentous forces, we did the same measurements intraoperatively at the height of the greater trochanter before and after hip joint replacement in 12 patients. We constructed a finite element model of the proximal femur and considering the IT. The acquisition of the data was done at physiological (128 degrees), varus (115 degrees), and valgus (155 degrees) femoral neck angles. The influencing forces of the IT at the height of the greater trochanter and the forces at the femoral head or the acetabulum could be measured. Our anatomical investigations revealed a splitting of the IT into a superficial and a deep portion, which covers the tensor fasciae latae. The tensor fasciae latae has an insertion on the IT. The IT continues down the femur, passing over the greater trochanter without developing an actual fixation to the bone. Part of the insertion of the gluteus maximus radiates into the IT. The IT passes over the vastus lateralis and inserts at the infracondylar tubercle of the tibia or Gerdy's tubercle, at the head of the fibula, as well as at the lateral intermuscular septum. Portions also insert on the transverse and longitudinal retinaculum of the patella. Concerning the material properties of the IT, we found a structural stiffness of 17 N/mm extension on average (D = 17 N/mm). The subligamentous measurements at the height of the greater trochanter in the unfixed corpse and intraoperatively during hip joint replacement showed an increase of the forces during adduction and a decrease during abduction of the hip joint. We found thereby a maximum increase up to 106 N with 40 degrees adduction. Concerning the femoral neck angle, we can state that valgus leads to lower subligamentous forces and varus to higher subligamentous forces. The forces directed at the acetabulum, which were measured by the prosthesis with a sensor along the femoral neck, showed a decrease with varus angles and an increase with valgus angles. The highest force of 624 N was measured with 40 degrees adduction and an angle of 155 degrees. The finite element model of the proximal femur showed a sole hip joint-centralizing force of the IT of 655 N with a femoral neck angle of 128 degrees after subtraction of the gluteal muscle force and the body weight. At 115 degrees, we found an increase up to 997 N and a decrease to 438 N at 155 degrees. Concerning the resulting forces in the acetabulum, we found opposite forces in comparison with the force of the IT at the height of the greater trochanter: at 115 degrees, a femoral head-centralizing force of 1601 N; at 128 degrees, 2360 N; and at 155 degrees, 2422 N. By our investigations, we can approximately prove the hip joint-centralizing force of the IT. By variation of the femoral neck angle and the position of the hip joint, we can predict the subligamentous force of the IT and the resulting force at the femoral head or at the acetabulum. The intraoperative measurement of the subligamentous forces of the IT is a good monitoring mechanism for the persistent hip-centralizing function of the IT in the course of hip joint replacement. The surgeon has the opportunity to check the stability of the hip joint after replacement. The finite element model gives the opportunity to check the divergent relative strength by variation of the femoral neck angle and the tension of the IT. In this way, the changes in the forces induced by a displacement osteotomy could be estimated preoperatively.",2004,26,6,433-46,10.1007/s00276-004-0265-8,#3352,Birnbaum 2004,
668,9149761.0,Locomotion in patients with spinal cord injuries.,Phys Ther,"Following central motor lesions, two forms of reorganization can be observed that lead to improved mobility: (1) the development of increased muscle tone and (2) the activation of spinal locomotor centers induced by specific treadmill training. Tension development is different from normal during spastic gait and appears to be independent of exaggerated monosynaptic stretch reflexes. Exaggerated stretch reflexes are associated with an absence or reduction of functionally essential polysynaptic reflexes. Based on observations of the locomotor capacity of the spinal cat, recent studies have indicated that spinal locomotor centers can be activated and trained in patients with complete or incomplete paraplegia when the body is partially unloaded. The level of electromyographic activity in the gastrocnemius muscle, however, is considerably lower in patients with central motor lesions than in persons without neurological impairments. During the course of a daily locomotor training program, the amplitude of gastrocnemius muscle electromyographic activity increases during the stance phase and inappropriate tibialis anterior muscle activity decreases. Such training programs can improve the ability of patients with incomplete paraplegia to walk on stationary surfaces. This article reviews the pathophysiology and functional importance of increased muscle tone and the effects of treadmill training on the locomotor pattern underlying new attempts to improve the mobility of patients with paraplegia.",1997,77,5,508-16,10.1093/ptj/77.5.508,#3353,Dietz 1997,

Mechanical tension measurements revealed that CRBM-0244 prevented bronchial hyperresponsiveness in TNF-α-pretreated human bronchi. Moreover, treatment with CRBM-0244 resulted in a decrease in NF-κB activation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression triggered by TNF-α. The inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ with GW9662 abolished the CRBM-0244-mediated anti-inflammatory effects. CRBM-0244 reduced the Ca(2+) sensitivity of bronchial smooth muscle through a decrease in the phosphorylation and expression of the PKC-potentiated inhibitory protein for heterotrimeric myosin light chain phosphatase of 17 kDa (CPI-17). Results also revealed an overexpression of CPI-17 protein in lung biopsies derived from patients with asthma. Furthermore, the presence of specialized enzymes such as 5-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase in the lung may convert CRBM-0244 into active mediators, leading to the resolution of inflammation. The in vivo anti-inflammatory properties of CRBM-0244 were also investigated in a guinea pig model of allergic asthma. After oral administration of CRBM-0244, airway leukocyte recruitment, airway mucus, ovalbumin-specific IgE, and proinflammatory markers such as TNF-α and COX-2 were markedly reduced. Hence, CRBM-0244 treatment prevents airway hyperresponsiveness, Ca(2+) hypersensitivity, and the overexpression of CPI-17 in lung tissue. Together, these findings provide key evidence regarding the mode of action of CRBM-0244 in the lung, and point to new therapeutic strategies for modulating inflammation in patients with asthma.",2011,45,2,366-75,10.1165/rcmb.2010-0156OC,#3355,Morin 2011,

The aim of the present study was to determine whether ERG channels were expressed in smooth muscle cells isolated from portal vein. RT-PCR demonstrated the expression of murine ERG (mERG), and real-time quantitative PCR showed that the mERG1b isoform predominated over the mERG1a, mERG2, and mERG3 in portal vein. Single myocytes from portal vein displayed membrane staining with an ERG1-specific antibody. Whole cell voltage-clamp experiments were performed to determine whether portal vein myocytes expressed functional ERG channels. Large inward currents with distinctive kinetics were elicited that were inhibited rapidly by E-4031 (mean amplitude of the E-4031-sensitive current at -120 mV was -205 +/- 24 pA; n = 14). Deactivation of the E-4031-sensitive current was voltage dependent (mean time constants at -80 and -120 mV were 103 +/- 9 and 33 +/- 2 ms, respectively; n = 13). Because of the rapid kinetics of mERG currents at more negative potentials, there was a substantial noninactivating ""window"" current that reached a maximum of -66 +/- 10 pA at -70 mV. Complete portal veins exhibited spontaneous contractile activity in isometric tension experiments, and this activity was modified significantly by E-4031. These data show that ERG channels are expressed in murine portal vein myocytes that may contribute to the resting membrane conductance.",2002,283,3,C866-77,10.1152/ajpcell.00099.2002,#3356,Ohya 2002,
672,25022569.0,Combining hypoxia and bioreactor hydrodynamics boosts induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation towards cardiomyocytes.,Stem Cell Rev Rep,"Cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise for patient-specific disease modeling, drug screening and cell therapy. However, existing protocols for CM differentiation of iPSCs besides being highly dependent on the application of expensive growth factors show low reproducibility and scalability. The aim of this work was to develop a robust and scalable strategy for mass production of iPSC-derived CMs by designing a bioreactor protocol that ensures a hypoxic and mechanical environment. Murine iPSCs were cultivated as aggregates in either stirred tank or WAVE bioreactors. The effect of dissolved oxygen and mechanical forces, promoted by different hydrodynamic environments, on CM differentiation was evaluated. Combining a hypoxia culture (4 % O2 tension) with an intermittent agitation profile in stirred tank bioreactors resulted in an improvement of about 1000-fold in CM yields when compared to normoxic (20 % O2 tension) and continuously agitated cultures. Additionally, we showed for the first time that wave-induced agitation enables the differentiation of iPSCs towards CMs at faster kinetics and with higher yields (60 CMs/input iPSC). In an 11-day differentiation protocol, clinically relevant numbers of CMs (2.3 × 10(9) CMs/1 L) were produced, and CMs exhibited typical cardiac sarcomeric structures, calcium transients, electrophysiological profiles and drug responsiveness. This work describes significant advances towards scalable cardiomyocyte differentiation of murine iPSC, paving the way for the implementation of this strategy for mass production of their human counterparts and their use for cardiac repair and cardiovascular research.",2014,10,6,786-801,10.1007/s12015-014-9533-0,#3357,Correia 2014,

We tested the hypothesis that exercise training of the quadriceps muscle with low rate ECC and high rate ECC contractions in the form of stretch-shortening cycles (SSCs) but at equal total mechanical work would produce rate-specific adaptations in healthy old males age 60-70. Both training programs produced similar improvements in maximal voluntary isometric (6%) and ECC torque (23%) and stretch-shortening cycle function (reduced contraction duration [24%] and enhanced elastic energy storage [12%]) (p<0.05). The rate of torque development increased 30% only after SSC exercise (p<0.05). Resting testosterone and cortisol levels were unchanged but after each program the acute exercise-induced cortisol levels were 12-15% lower (p<0.05). Both programs increased quadriceps size 2.5% (p<0.05). It is concluded that both ECC and SSC exercise training produces favorable adaptations in healthy old males' quadriceps muscle. Although the rate of muscle tension during the SSC vs. ECC contractions was about 4-fold greater, the total mechanical work seems to regulate the hypetrophic, hormonal, and most of the mechanical adaptations. However, SSC exercise was uniquely effective in improving a key deficiency of aging muscle, i.e., its ability to produce force rapidly.",2014,58,,69-77,10.1016/j.exger.2014.07.013,#3358,VÃ¡czi 2014,Aging

Seminal work in prokaryotes and invertebrates provided strong evidence for the role of specific ion channels in volume regulation, touch sensitivity, or hearing, specifically the mechanosensitive channel subunits of large and small conductances (MscL and MscS), the mechanosensory channel subunits (MEC) and the transient receptor potential channel subunits (TRP). In mammals, recent studies further indicate that members of the TRP channel family may also be considered as possible candidate mechanosensors responding to either tension, flow, or changes in cell volume. However, contradictory results have challenged whether these TRP channels, including TRPC1 and TRPC6, are directly activated by mechanical stimulation. In the present review, we will focus on the mechanosensory function of TRP channels, discuss whether a direct or indirect mechanism is at play, and focus on the proposed role for these channels in the arterial myogenic response to changes in intraluminal pressure.",2008,456,3,529-40,10.1007/s00424-007-0432-y,#3359,Sharif-Naeini 2008,

The vascular effects of the peptide and its interaction with cAMP- and cGMP-dependent relaxation were investigated in human arteries and veins. Internal mammary arteries and veins and saphenous veins were obtained intraoperatively and suspended in organ chambers; isometric tension was recorded. The blood vessels were contracted with ET-1 or norepinephrine and relaxations to prostacyclin or sodium nitroprusside were studied. Mammary veins exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to ET-1 (10(-11) to 3 X 10(-7) M) as compared to the artery and saphenous vein (log shift at ED50: 32- and 79-fold, respectively; p less than 0.005). In saphenous veins maximally contracted with ET-1, relaxations to prostacyclin were blunted as compared to the artery (p less than 0.005; n = 5). Similarly, ET-1 inhibited relaxations to sodium nitroprusside in the vein, but not in the artery. In contrast, venous rings contracted with norepinephrine were more sensitive to sodium nitroprusside than the artery. Thus, the human mammary vein, but not the saphenous vein, is more sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effects of ET-1 when compared to the mammary artery. In veins, ET-1 but not norepinephrine inhibits the vascular effects of prostacyclin and sodium nitroprusside, suggesting a specific interaction of the peptide with cAMP- and cGMP-dependent relaxation.",1989,13 Suppl 5,,S129-31; discussion S142,10.1097/00005344-198900135-00032,#3360,Yang 1989,

We previously used human primary cells in vitro and mice in vivo to demonstrate that simultaneously enhancing myometrial P4 and cAMP levels may reduce inflammation-associated preterm labor. Here, we assessed whether aminophylline (Ami; phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and P4 can reduce myometrial contractility and contraction-associated proteins (CAPs) better together than individually; both agents are clinically used drugs. Myometrial tissues from pregnant non-laboring women were treated ex vivo with Ami acutely (while spontaneous contracting) or throughout 24-h tissue culture (±P4); isometric tension measurements, PKA assays, and Western blotting were used to assess tissue contractility, cAMP action, and inflammation. Acute (1 h) treatment with 250 and 750 μM Ami reduced contractions by 50% and 84%, respectively, which was not associated with a directly proportional increase in whole tissue PKA activity. Sustained myometrial relaxation was observed during 24-h tissue culture with 750 μM Ami, which did not require P4 nor reduce CAPs. COX-2 protein can be reduced by 300 nM P4 but this did not equate to myometrial relaxation. Ami (250 μM) and P4 (100 and 300 nM) co-treatment did not prevent oxytocin-augmented contractions nor reduce CAPs during interleukin-1β stimulation. Overall, Ami and P4 co-treatment did not suppress myometrial contractions more than either agent alone, which may be attributed to low specificity and efficacy of Ami; cAMP and P4 action at in utero neighboring reproductive tissues during pregnancy should also be considered.",2021,9,4,e00818,10.1002/prp2.818,#3361,Lai 2021,cAMP

The lesion is rarely diagnosed early, therefore treatment is often subacute or chronic. In these cases, procedures such as radial head replacement, ulnar shortening and/or wafer procedures should be combined with reconstruction of the interosseous membrane central band to restore longitudinal stability of the forearm.

678,19686430.0,Evaluating the role of the serotoninergic system in the control of human seminal vesicle smooth muscle-an in vitro approach.,J Sex Med,"INTRODUCTION: It has been suggested that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SRIs) may retard the ejaculatory response by acting directly on the seminal vesicle (SV) and ductus deferens smooth muscle. However, until now, only a very few experimental studies have investigated such potential local (peripheral) effects. AIM: To elucidate the effects of serotonin (5-HT) and the SRIs clomipramine, fluoxetine and imipramine on the tension induced by norepinephrine (NE) of isolated human SV smooth muscle, as well as on the production of tissue cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To measure the inhibition exerted by serotonin and SRIs clomipramine, fluoxetine, and imipramine on the contractile response of isolated SV tissue. In addition, the effects of the drugs on the turn-over of cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP were also elucidated. METHODS: The effects of the cumulative addition of serotonin and the SRIs clomipramine, fluoxetine and imipramine (1 nM-10 microM) on the tension induced by the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist NE (10 microM) of SV strip preparations were studied using the organ bath technique. Cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP were measured by means of specific radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: The tension induced by NE was dose-dependently reversed by the drugs tested. The rank order of efficacy was: imipramine > or = fluoxetine > or = clomipramine > serotonin. Mean reversion of tension was measured between 66 +/- 6.6% and 52 +/- 6.6%. These effects were paralleled by a 1.3-fold to 2.7-fold increase in tissue cAMP in response to exposure to the drugs. In contrast, no significant enhancement in cGMP was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The findings, for the first time, present evidence that SRIs may antagonize the sympathetic contraction of SV smooth muscle via stimulation of tissue cyclic AMP.",2009,6,10,2672-9,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01423.x,#3363,Birowo 2009,
679,7713139.0,Epithelium-derived inhibitory prostaglandins modulate human bronchial smooth muscle responses to histamine.,Eur J Pharmacol,"The role of the bronchial epithelium and inhibitory prostaglandins in the induction of histamine tachyphylaxis in human isolated bronchial smooth muscle was investigated using bronchi obtained from 14 patients who had been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for > 2 months and from 14 untreated patients. Epithelium-intact bronchial strips from untreated patients demonstrated tachyphylaxis to histamine with the maximum response (Emax) reduced by 30 +/- 5% (P < 0.02) and the EC50 increased 1.86-fold (P < 0.02). Tachyphylaxis was not observed in epithelium-denuded strips. In epithelium-intact bronchial preparations from NSAID treated patients, the mean initial maximum tension generated in response to histamine was significantly greater than that for bronchial preparations from untreated patients (P < 0.05). In NSAID-treated patients, both epithelium-intact and denuded preparations failed to demonstrate tachyphylaxis. The generation of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin was assessed by radio-immunoassay using bronchi from untreated patients (n = 8). In epithelium-intact bronchial preparations, the generation of both prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin was significantly increased by histamine exposure (P < 0.05) and was completely inhibited by indomethacin. However, the selective histamine H2 receptor antagonist, ranitidine, selectively inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 alone. Production of both prostaglandins was not altered by exposure to acetylcholine. These results suggest that prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin are released primarily from the epithelium in response to histamine and may be specifically involved in inhibiting human bronchial smooth muscle responsiveness to this mediator. Significantly, the release of prostaglandin E2 appears to be selectively controlled by histamine H2 receptors, resident on the epithelium.",1995,272,1,11-Jan,10.1016/0014-2999(94)00601-3,#3364,Knight 1995,
680,19299064.0,Integration of endocrine and mechanical signals in the regulation of myometrial functions during pregnancy and labour.,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"In this review, we describe a new model to explain the regulation of myometrial function during pregnancy and labour. We propose that the myometrium undergoes dramatic changes in phenotype from early pregnancy until the onset of labour, characterized by an early proliferative phase, an intermediate phase of cellular hypertrophy and matrix elaboration, a third phase in which the cells assume a contractile phenotype and the final phase in which cells become highly active and committed to labour. The last phase of myometrial differentiation is postpartum uterine involution, completing the reproductive cycle following pregnancy and labour by returning the uterus to its non-pregnant receptive state. We further propose that phenotypic modulation of the uterine myocytes is the result of integration of endocrine signals and mechanical stimulation of the uterus by the growing fetus. Our previous studies have shown that these signals are important in regulating the onset of labour and we now have indications that they regulate earlier myometrial smooth muscle differentiation. We show that the high rate of myometrial cell proliferation in early pregnancy which reflects important aspects of many smooth muscle populations during development. The proliferative phenotype was associated with dramatic changes in the expression of IGF family proteins and coincided with an up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic pathway. Preliminary evidence suggests that myometrial hyperplasia was controlled by the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. The modulation of the mTOR pathway by rapamycin blocked the proliferative activity of the uterine myocytes. The growth and remodeling of the myometrium during pregnancy was associated with increased synthesis of extra cellular matrix (ECM) proteins and their corresponding integrin receptors. Our results show a decrease in expression of fibrillar collagens and a coordinated temporal increase in expression of components of the basement membrane near term associated with decreased progesterone levels and increased mechanical tension. The phenotypic modulation of uterine smooth muscle cells during pregnancy culminates at term when a myometrium-specific conversion commits these cells to the labour phenotype, characterized by increased excitability, spontaneous activity, responsiveness to agonists and effective coupling of the myocytes. The reinforcement of the ECM-integrin interaction contributes to myometrial hypertrophy and remodeling during late pregnancy and facilitates force transduction during the contractions of labour by anchoring hypertrophied SMCs to the uterine ECM. In addition, we suggest that myometrial cells play an important role in the generation and regulation of uterine inflammation, which is a characteristic feature of parturition. We provide here substantial evidence that myometrial cells can actively participate in the inflammatory process in the uterus by the release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine MCP-1. The increased production of MCP-1 in the term myometrium was associated with uterine occupancy and regulated by progesterone, suggesting that mechanical and endocrine signals integrate to regulate the expression of the chemokine and the induction of labour. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating myometrial differentiation during pregnancy might inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for the management of preterm labour, which remains a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Our data are obtained mostly from the rat, but we believe that they are generally applicable across species.",2009,144 Suppl 1,,S2-10,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2009.02.044,#3365,Shynlova 2009,
681,9336335.0,Effect of cyclopiazonic acid on the force-frequency relationship in human nonfailing myocardium.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"The present study investigated the functional role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca++-ATPase in contraction and relaxation, intracellular Ca++-transients, as well as on the force-frequency relationship in human myocardium. The Ca++-ATPase activity of membrane vesicles isolated from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) obtained from nonfailing donor hearts (n = 7) was measured in the presence of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 0-30 microM), a highly specific inhibitor of the Ca++-ATPase of the SR (SERCA). The effects of CPA on parameters of contraction and relaxation, force-frequency relationship and [Ca++]i transients (with fura-2) were studied on isolated left ventricular muscle strips from human nonfailing myocardium. CPA concentration-dependently inhibited SERCA activity of isolated SR vesicles. In the presence of CPA (30 microM) the former positive force-frequency relationship in human left ventricular nonfailing myocardium became negative. Especially at high frequencies of stimulation, CPA decreased developed tension, peak rate of tension rise and systolic fura-2-light emission, whereas time to peak tension, time to peak [Ca++]i, time to 95% relaxation, diastolic tension and diastolic Ca++ levels were increased. Peak rate of tension decay and time to half-relaxation and half-decay of [Ca++]i were not altered significantly after treatment with CPA. These findings provide evidence that the SERCA plays a functional role in the frequency-dependent increase in force of contraction in human myocardium. Because an impaired function of the SERCA is predominantly followed by alterations of inotropic and to a lesser degree of lusitropic function, other important factors to lower [Ca++]i and influence relaxation may be present in human myocardium to compensate for the reduced SERCA activity, e.g., Na+-Ca++ exchanger.",1997,283,1,286-92,,#3366,Schwinger 1997,
682,15165598.0,Influence of knee angle and individual flexibility on the flexion-relaxation response of the low back musculature.,J Electromyogr Kinesiol,"In many occupational settings (e.g. agriculture and construction) workers are asked to maintain static flexed postures of the low back for extended periods of time. Recent research indicates that the resulting strain in the viscoelastic, ligamentous tissues may have a deleterious effect on the stability of the spine and the normal reflex response of spinal tissues. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the previously described flexion-relaxation response in terms of the interactive effect of trunk flexion angle (30 degrees, 50 degrees, 70 degrees, 90 degrees ), knee flexion angle (0 degrees (straight knees), 20 degrees, 40 degrees ) and individual flexibiliteky (low, medium, and high). These conditions were tested under two levels of loading: no load (just supporting the weight of the torso) and trunk extension moment equal to 50% of the subject's posture-specific maximum voluntary trunk extension capacity. Surface electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from the multifidus, the longissimus, the iliocostalis, the vastus medialis, the rectus femoris, the vastus lateralis, the biceps femoris, and the gastrocnemius-soleus group from a sample of eight male participants as they performed isometric weight holding tasks in the postures defined by the combinations of trunk angle and knee angle. The results of this study showed that knee angle did have a significant effect on the lumbar extensor muscle activity but only consistently at the 90 degrees trunk angle. Participant flexibility showed a consistent trend of decreasing lumbar extensor muscle activity with decreased flexibility across all trunk angle values. Most interesting was the interactive response of flexibility and knee angle, wherein the flexibility of the participant influenced the trunk angles at which the knee flexion angle affected the flexion-relaxation response. Highly flexible subjects showed an effect of knee angle on the flexion-relaxation response only at the 90 degrees trunk angle; subjects in the medium flexibility category showed a similar response in both the 70 degrees and 90 degrees trunk angles; subject in the low flexibility group showed no knee angle effect on the flexion-relaxation response. Overall the results confirm previous results with regard to the contribution of the passive tissues to the overall trunk extension moment but also show that the tension in the bi-articular biceps femoris, which was influenced by knee flexion angle and flexibility, affects the ratio of active extensor moment contributions of the lumbar extensor musculature to passive extensor moment contributions from the muscular and ligamentous tissues. The results of this study provide empirical data describing this complicated, interactive response.",2004,14,4,485-94,10.1016/j.jelekin.2003.12.001,#3367,Shin 2004,
683,30203398.0,Myofascial trigger points in migraine and tension-type headache.,J Headache Pain,"BACKGROUND: A myofascial trigger point is defined as a hyperirritable spot in skeletal muscle that is associated with a hypersensitive palpable nodule in a taut band. It has been suggested that myofascial trigger points take part in chronic pain conditions including primary headache disorders. The aim of this narrative review is to present an overview of the current imaging modalities used for the detection of myofascial trigger points and to review studies of myofascial trigger points in migraine and tension-type headache. FINDINGS: Different modalities have been used to assess myofascial trigger points including ultrasound, microdialysis, electromyography, infrared thermography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Ultrasound is the most promising of these modalities and may be used to identify MTrPs if specific methods are used, but there is no precise description of a gold standard using these techniques, and they have yet to be evaluated in headache patients. Active myofascial trigger points are prevalent in migraine patients. Manual palpation can trigger migraine attacks. All intervention studies aiming at trigger points are positive, but this needs to be further verified in placebo-controlled environments. These findings may imply a causal bottom-up association, but studies of migraine patients with comorbid fibromyalgia syndrome suggest otherwise. Whether myofascial trigger points contribute to an increased migraine burden in terms of frequency and intensity is unclear. Active myofascial trigger points are prevalent in tension-type headache coherent with the hypothesis that peripheral mechanisms are involved in the pathophysiology of this headache disorder. Active myofascial trigger points in pericranial muscles in tension-type headache patients are correlated with generalized lower pain pressure thresholds indicating they may contribute to a central sensitization. However, the number of active myofascial trigger points is higher in adults compared with adolescents regardless of no significant association with headache parameters. This suggests myofascial trigger points are accumulated over time as a consequence of TTH rather than contributing to the pathophysiology. CONCLUSIONS: Myofascial trigger points are prevalent in both migraine and tension-type headache, but the role they play in the pathophysiology of each disorder and to which degree is unclarified. In the future, ultrasound elastography may be an acceptable diagnostic test.",2018,19,1,84,10.1186/s10194-018-0913-8,#3368,Do 2018,Diagnostic test
684,3309463.0,Methods for the metabolic quantification of regional myocardial ischemia.,J Surg Res,"An adequate balance between oxygen supply and demand is a basic requirement for normal cardiac function. When oxygen supply does not meet the demand, progressive cellular damage occurs leading to cardiac dysfunction and, ultimately, tissue death. While traditionally ""ischemia"" has been defined as decreased oxygen supply secondary to a decrease in blood flow, and ""hypoxia"" as decreased oxygen supply secondary to a decrease in oxygen tension, this review defines ischemia in its broader sense, namely as a pathophysiologic state in which there is a lack of oxygen relative to the demand for it. In a large number of experimental studies involving the heart, there is need to promptly recognize the ischemic state, to monitor its course in vivo, and to quantify it. Because of cardiac autoregulatory mechanisms, research methods which attempt to quantify supply (e.g., measurement of myocardial blood flow) and/or demand (e.g., measurement of myocardial oxygen consumption) do not necessarily reflect the status of the balance between supply and demand. An imbalance between myocardial supply and demand is more likely to be reflected by metabolic fluxes and by the accumulation of products specific to the ischemic state. Thus, the purpose of this review is to summarize the various methods available to the cardiac surgical investigator today for the metabolic quantification of myocardial ischemia. Due to the complexity of the heart and its inherent regional differences, myocardial ischemic changes are frequently regional in nature. Thus, this review will address metabolic methods for the regional quantification of myocardial ischemia.",1987,43,4,360-78,10.1016/0022-4804(87)90093-x,#3369,Siouffi 1987,
685,12617755.0,Myosin heavy chain and physiological adaptation of the rat diaphragm in elastase-induced emphysema.,Respir Res,"BACKGROUND: Several physiological adaptations occur in the respiratory muscles in rodent models of elastase-induced emphysema. Although the contractile properties of the diaphragm are altered in a way that suggests expression of slower isoforms of myosin heavy chain (MHC), it has been difficult to demonstrate a shift in MHCs in an animal model that corresponds to the shift toward slower MHCs seen in human emphysema. METHODS: We sought to identify MHC and corresponding physiological changes in the diaphragms of rats with elastase-induced emphysema. Nine rats with emphysema and 11 control rats were studied 10 months after instillation with elastase. MHC isoform composition was determined by both reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry by using specific probes able to identify all known adult isoforms. Physiological adaptation was studied on diaphragm strips stimulated in vitro. RESULTS: In addition to confirming that emphysematous diaphragm has a decreased fatigability, we identified a significantly longer time-to-peak-tension (63.9 +/- 2.7 ms versus 53.9 +/- 2.4 ms). At both the RNA (RT-PCR) and protein (immunocytochemistry) levels, we found a significant decrease in the fastest, MHC isoform (IIb) in emphysema. CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration of MHC shifts and corresponding physiological changes in the diaphragm in an animal model of emphysema. It is established that rodent emphysema, like human emphysema, does result in a physiologically significant shift toward slower diaphragmatic MHC isoforms. In the rat, this occurs at the faster end of the MHC spectrum than in humans.",2003,4,1,1,10.1186/rr196,#3370,Kim 2003,
686,28082334.0,Moderate-intensity resistance exercise alters skeletal muscle molecular and cellular structure and function in inactive older adults with knee osteoarthritis.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"High-intensity resistance exercise (REX) training increases physical capacity, in part, by improving muscle cell size and function. Moderate-intensity REX, which is more feasible for many older adults with disease and/or disability, also increases physical function, but the mechanisms underlying such improvements are not understood. Therefore, we measured skeletal muscle structure and function from the molecular to the tissue level in response to 14 wk of moderate-intensity REX in physically inactive older adults with knee osteoarthritis (n = 17; 70 ± 1 yr). Although REX training increased quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), average single-fiber CSA was unchanged because of reciprocal changes in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIA fibers. Intermyofibrillar mitochondrial content increased with training because of increases in mitochondrial size in men, but not women, with no changes in subsarcolemmal mitochondria in either sex. REX increased whole muscle contractile performance similarly in men and women. In contrast, adaptations in single-muscle fiber force production per CSA (i.e., tension) and contractile velocity varied between men and women in a fiber type-dependent manner, with adaptations being explained at the molecular level by differential changes in myosin-actin cross-bridge kinetics and mechanics and single-fiber MHC protein expression. Our results are notable compared with studies of high-intensity REX because they show that the effects of moderate-intensity REX in older adults on muscle fiber size/structure and myofilament function are absent or modest. Moreover, our data highlight unique sex-specific adaptations due to differential cellular and subcellular structural and functional changes.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Moderate-intensity resistance training causes sex-specific adaptations in skeletal muscle structure and function at the cellular and molecular levels in inactive older adult men and women with knee osteoarthritis. However, these responses were minimal compared with high-intensity resistance training. Thus adjuncts to moderate-intensity training need to be developed to correct underlying cellular and molecular structural and functional deficits that are at the root of impaired physical function in this mobility-limited population.",2017,122,4,775-787,10.1152/japplphysiol.00830.2016,#3371,Miller 2017,mitochondria
687,28371863.0,Hypercontractile mutant of ventricular myosin essential light chain leads to disruption of sarcomeric structure and function and results in restrictive cardiomyopathy in mice.,Cardiovasc Res,"AIMS: The E143K (Glu → Lys) mutation in the myosin essential light chain has been associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) in humans, but the mechanisms that underlie the development of defective cardiac function are unknown. Using transgenic E143K-RCM mice, we sought to determine the molecular and cellular triggers of E143K-induced heart remodelling. METHODS AND RESULTS: The E143K-induced abnormalities in cardiac function and morphology observed by echocardiography and invasive haemodynamics were paralleled by augmented active and passive tension measured in skinned papillary muscle fibres compared with wild-type (WT)-generated force. In vitro, E143K-myosin had increased duty ratio and binding affinity to actin compared with WT-myosin, increased actin-activated ATPase activity and slower rates of ATP-dependent dissociation of the acto-myosin complex, indicating an E143K-induced myosin hypercontractility. E143K was also observed to reduce the level of myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation while that of troponin-I remained unchanged. Small-angle X-ray diffraction data showed a decrease in the filament lattice spacing (d1,0) with no changes in the equatorial reflections intensity ratios (I1,1/I1,0) in E143K vs. WT skinned papillary muscles. The hearts of mutant-mice demonstrated ultrastructural defects and fibrosis that progressively worsened in senescent animals and these changes were hypothesized to contribute to diastolic disturbance and to mild systolic dysfunction. Gene expression profiles of E143K-hearts supported the histopathology results and showed an upregulation of stress-response and collagen genes. Finally, proteomic analysis evidenced RCM-dependent metabolic adaptations and higher energy demands in E143K vs. WT hearts. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the E143K-induced myosin hypercontractility, the hearts of RCM mice model exhibited cardiac dysfunction, stiff ventricles and physiological, morphologic, and metabolic remodelling consistent with the development of RCM. Future efforts should be directed toward normalization of myosin motor function and the use of myosin-specific therapeutics to avert the hypercontractile state of E143K-myosin and prevent pathological cardiac remodelling.",2017,113,10,1124-1136,10.1093/cvr/cvx060,#3372,Yuan 2017,Cardiac myosin essential light chain

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of intravenous ET-1 administration on canine urethral pressure was determined in the presence and absence of PD155080. The affinity of PD155080 for endothelin-mediated contraction was determined using antagonist dissociation studies. Saturation and competition binding studies were performed using [125I] ET-1 in both human and canine prostate. RESULTS: ET-1 bolus injection elicited shallow and prolonged increases the prostatic urethral pressure. Pretreatment with PD155080 totally abolished the urethral contractile response to ET-1. Specific [125I] ET-1 binding was saturable and of high affinity. Two ET receptor subtypes (ETA receptor, ETB receptor) have been identified in human prostate. The ratio of ETA to ETB receptors was approximately 1.5:1 in both human and canine prostates. Isometric tension studies revealed that PD155080 shifted the ET-1 dose-response curves to the right and exhibited no effect on the ETB receptor selective agonist sarafotoxin dose-response curves.

689,21597981.0,Suppression of anger and subsequent pain intensity and behavior among chronic low back pain patients: the role of symptom-specific physiological reactivity.,J Behav Med,"Suppression of anger may be linked to heightened pain report and pain behavior during a subsequent painful event among chronic low back patients, but it is not clear whether these effects are partly accounted for by increased physiological reactivity during suppression. Chronic low back pain patients (N = 58) were assigned to Suppression or No Suppression conditions for a ""cooperative"" computer maze task during which a confederate harassed them. During baseline and maze task, patients' lower paraspinal and trapezius muscle tension, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. After the maze task, patients underwent a structured pain behavior task (behaviors were videotaped and coded). Results showed that: (a) Suppression condition patients revealed greater lower paraspinal muscle tension and systolic blood pressure (SBP) increases during maze task than No Suppression patients (previously published results showed that Suppression condition patients exhibited more pain behaviors than No Suppression patients); (b) residualized lower paraspinal and SBP change scores were related significantly to pain behaviors; (c) both lower paraspinal and SBP reactivity significantly mediated the relationship between Condition and frequency of pain behaviors. Results suggest that suppression-induced lower paraspinal muscle tension and SBP increases may link the actual suppression of anger during provocation to signs of clinically relevant pain among chronic low back pain patients.",2012,35,1,103-14,10.1007/s10865-011-9347-3,#3374,Burns 2012,

We have investigated the mechanisms of the NANC dilator response in the isolated small mesenteric artery of the rabbit by use of the tension myograph. 2 Small second or third order (150-300 microm in diameter) arteries of the rabbit mesenteric bed were mounted in a Mulvany tension myograph. Responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS) and exogenous vasodilators were investigated. 3 EFS (0.5-16 Hz, 10 V, 0.3 ms for 5 s), in the presence of guanethidine (5 microM) and atropine (1 microM) produced frequency-dependent relaxation of small arteries. Pretreatment with tetrodotoxin (1 microM) abolished the relaxation and desensitization with capsaicin (10 microM) strongly inhibited the relaxation. 4 Pretreatment with a P2Y-purinoceptor antagonist, basilen blue (3 microM) or a human calcitonin gene-related peptide (hCGRP) receptor antagonist, hCGRP8-37 (1 microM) suppressed the NANC relaxation by approximately 40-60 % in each case and combined pretreatment almost abolished the relaxation. 5 The EFS-induced relaxation was suppressed by endothelium-removal, pretreatment with the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (1 microM) and the NO scavenger oxyhaemoglobin (OxyHb; 20 microM) but not by NO synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 300 microM) or NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG; 300 microM). Combined pretreatment with ODQ and CGRP8-37 almost abolished the relaxation. 6 A P2Y-purinoceptor agonist, 2-methylthio ATP, produced endothelium-dependent relaxation which was inhibited by L-NAME and ODQ (1 microM), whilst hCGRP produced endothelium-independent and ODQ-insensitive relaxation. 7 Ultraviolet light (320 nm, 5 shots over 20 s) produced relaxation that was blocked by both OxyHb and ODQ but not by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 300 microM). 8 The present study suggests that EFS-induced NANC relaxation of the mesenteric small artery of the rabbit is mediated mainly by capsaicin-sensitive sensory C-fibres and that both ATP and CGRP are involved. The action of ATP released by EFS appears to be endothelium-dependent and involve activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, but is resistant to inhibitors of NO synthase. The response to CGRP is endothelium-independent. These results show that ATP and CGRP account fully for the NANC relaxation of this vessel type and that the endothelium is involved in NANC-induced relaxation. The endothelium-dependent part of the response is consistent with the release of NO, either from NO synthase, incompletely inhibited by the NO synthase inhibitors, or by some preformed stores.",1998,123,2,310-6,10.1038/sj.bjp.0701610,#3375,Kakuyama 1998,
691,7074226.0,Effect of thrombin on isolated canine blood vessels.,Blood Vessels,"The aim of the present study was to assess whether or not thrombin affects vascular smooth muscle activity by a direct action on the blood vessel wall. In isolated saphenous veins and femoral and pulmonary arteries thrombin did not affect basal tension, but in pulmonary and portal mesenteric veins it caused contraction. In saphenous and femoral veins and in femoral and pulmonary arteries the enzyme depressed contractions evoked by alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In the saphenous vein thrombin also depressed contractions induced with acetylcholine or potassium ions. In this blood vessel the relaxation caused by thrombin was abolished by antithrombin III and the tripeptide D-phenylalanine-proline-arginine-CH2Cl, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme center of thrombin. In pulmonary and portal mesenteric veins, thrombin potentiated the contractile response to norepinephrine. These contractile effects of thrombin were also abolished by D-phenylalanine-proline-arginine-CH2Cl. Thus, thrombin causes relaxation or contraction of blood vessels through a direct action on the blood vessel wall. These effects are due to its proteolytic activity.",1982,19,3,126-34,,#3376,Janssens 1982,
692,1942315.0,Basal and acetylcholine-stimulated nitric oxide formation mediates relaxation of rabbit cavernous smooth muscle.,J Urol,"Externally applied acetylcholine (ACh) in human corpus cavernosum has been shown to cause endothelium-dependent smooth muscle relaxation. Changes in isometric tension in rabbit cavernous smooth muscle strips mounted in organ bath chambers were monitored in the presence of blocking agents. Nitric oxide (NO) is known as an endothelium-derived relaxation factor (EDRF). Addition of specific inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis, such as L-n-monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA) at 5 x 10(-4) mol/l.. or L-n-nitro arginine (L-NOARG) at 2 x 10(-4) mol/l. to strips precontracted with phenylephrine (PE) at 3.16 x 10(-6) mol/l. led to significant increases in tension. In the presence of L-NMMA or L-NOARG, relaxing effects of ACh at 10(-8)-3.16 x 10(-5) mol/l. mediated by muscarinic receptors were almost completely abolished. These data indicate that rabbit cavernous smooth muscle is under the control of basal NO release. They constitute strong evidence that cholinergically induced endothelial formation of NO plays a crucial role in relaxing cavernous smooth muscle.",1991,146,5,1429-33,10.1016/s0022-5347(17)38129-6,#3377,Knispel 1991,
693,26015507.0,Investigation of the vasorelaxant effects of moxonidine and its relaxation mechanism on the human radial artery when used as a coronary bypass graft.,Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,"OBJECTIVES: In both low- and high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, the internal mammary artery is the first choice of arterial graft, and the second choice is the radial artery (RA). Unfortunately, RA spasms are a significant problem for a surgical team to overcome in the perioperative and postoperative period. In current surgical practice, the use of vasodilator agents perioperatively in the pending graft preparation is generally accepted and these may be implemented topically, endoluminally or both ways. Moxonidine is the latest second-generation, centrally acting antihypertensive agent, and the intention in this paper is to investigate its direct vasorelaxant effects and relaxation mechanisms on the human radial artery in vitro. METHODS: RA rings were mounted in an organ bath and tested for changes in isometric tension in its relaxation response to moxonidine in the presence and absence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, non-specific inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase), idazoxan (non-selective I1 and α2-antagonist) and yohimbine (selective α2-antagonist). RESULTS: Moxonidine induced concentration-dependent relaxations on the RA rings precontracted with phenylephrine (P < 0.05). L-NAME and idazoxan significantly reduced the relaxation caused by moxonidine (P < 0.05), while yohimbine significantly increased the relaxation by moxonidine (P < 0.05). In the presence of L-NAME + idazoxan, the relaxation by moxonidine was eliminated completely (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that the relaxant effect of moxonidine may be attributed partly to the synthesis and/or release of nitric oxide, and partly to the stimulation of imidazoline I1 receptors. We suggest that moxonidine may help to prevent RA spasms during the preparation period in operation when used topically or/and endoluminally.",2015,21,3,342-5,10.1093/icvts/ivv136,#3378,Sarac 2015,Coronary artery bypass graft
694,8114678.0,Binding and functional properties of endothelin receptor subtypes in the human prostate.,Mol Pharmacol,"The objective of the present study was to characterize the binding and functional properties of endothelin (ET) receptor subtypes in the human prostate. Human prostatic tissue was obtained from male subjects undergoing radical prostatectomy for low-volume prostate cancer. The optimal assay conditions for characterizing human prostatic ET-1 binding sites on slide-mounted tissue sections were defined. Maximal specific 125I-ET-1 binding was achieved after a 10-min preincubation, a 120-min incubation, and a washing procedure that consisted of a brief rinse and a 1-min wash. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and density (Bmax) of ET-1 binding sites determined from six saturation studies were 0.72 +/- 0.13 nM and 40.4 +/- 6.9 fmol/mg of wet weight, respectively. The mean Hill coefficient was 0.99 +/- 0.01, indicating that 125I-ET-1 identifies a single population of binding sites. The pharmacology of 125I-ET-1 binding sites was characterized using competitive binding experiments. The competition plots for ET-1 were best fit by a one-binding site model, whereas the plots for sarafotoxin 6C (S6C) and BQ123 were consistently best fit by a two-site model. The mean Ki value of ET-1 was 0.34 +/- 0.12 nM. The mean Ki values for the high and low affinity S6C binding sites were 0.50 +/- 0.09 nM and 0.84 +/- 0.28 microM, respectively. The mean Ki values for the high and low affinity BQ123 binding sites were 5.51 +/- 1.05 nM and 24.9 +/- 6.5 microM, respectively. The ratio of ETA to ETB binding sites was approximately 2:1. The ET receptor subtype mediating prostatic smooth muscle tension was investigated using agonist-antagonist competition studies. ET-1, a nonselective ET agonist, elicited a potent contraction of prostate smooth muscle. The pA2 of BQ123 for inhibiting ET-1-mediated contraction was 6.84. S6C, a selective ETB agonist, also elicited a potent contraction of prostate smooth muscle. BQ123 at concentractions between 0.1 and 10 microM did not shift the S6C dose-response curve. These functional studies suggest that both ETA and ETB receptors mediate the tension of prostate smooth muscle. Endogenous ETS may be involved in the pathophysiology of bladder outlet obstruction in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. If this is the case, then ET antagonists may represent effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia.",1994,45,2,306-11,,#3379,Kobayashi 1994,
695,27353610.0,Postnatal Development of Right Ventricular Myofibrillar Biomechanics in Relation to the Sarcomeric Protein Phenotype in Pediatric Patients with Conotruncal Heart Defects.,J Am Heart Assoc,"BACKGROUND: The postnatal development of myofibrillar mechanics, a major determinant of heart function, is unknown in pediatric patients with tetralogy of Fallot and related structural heart defects. We therefore determined the mechanical properties of myofibrils isolated from right ventricular tissue samples from such patients in relation to the developmental changes of the isoforms expression pattern of key sarcomere proteins involved in the contractile process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue samples from the infundibulum obtained during surgery from 25 patients (age range 15 days to 11 years, median 7 months) were split into half for mechanical investigations and expression analysis of titin, myosin heavy and light chain 1, troponin-T, and troponin-I. Of these proteins, fetal isoforms of only myosin light chain 1 (ALC-1) and troponin-I (ssTnI) were highly expressed in neonates, amounting to, respectively, 40% and 80%, while the other proteins had switched to the adult isoforms before or around birth. ALC-1 and ssTnI expression subsequently declined monoexponentially with a halftime of 4.3 and 5.8 months, respectively. Coincident with the expression of ssTnI, Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction was high in neonates and subsequently declined in parallel with the decline in ssTnI expression. Passive tension positively correlated with Ca(2+) sensitivity but not with titin expression. Contraction kinetics, maximal Ca(2+)-activated force, and the fast phase of the biphasic relaxation positively correlated with the expression of ALC-1. CONCLUSIONS: The developmental changes in myofibrillar biomechanics can be ascribed to fetal-to-adult isoform transition of key sarcomeric proteins, which evolves regardless of the specific congenital cardiac malformations in our pediatric patients.",2016,5,6,,10.1161/JAHA.116.003699,#3380,Elhamine 2016,cardiac myofibrils

The practice of using sensory grafts to repair motor nerve defects is challenged by the discovery of preferential motor reinnervation and modality specific nerve regeneration. In this article, two clinical cases are presented where accessory nerve injuries are repaired with either a motor nerve transfer (a branch of C7) or a motor autograft (obturator nerve), and excellent functional results are reported.

DESIGN: Four tasks were presented in counterbalanced order and included neutral, general stressor, personal stressor, and pain stressor tasks. Ratings of stressfulness and recordings of skin conductance level confirmed the effectiveness of the experimental manipulations in inducing stress experiences for all subject groups. SETTING: The study was conducted in a university research center. PATIENTS: Thirty patients with CTD were matched as closely as possible for age and gender to control groups of chronic low back pain, arthritis, and pain-free subjects. OUTCOME MEASURES: Surface electromyograph recordings were taken from the frontalis, forearm flexors, trapezius, and lower back during baseline and tasks. RESULTS: The study found no evidence of greater muscle tension increases or extended duration of return to baseline for the CTD or low back pain patients at any of the muscle sites for any of the tasks in comparison to control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that symptom-specific psychophysiological responses may be limited to certain subgroups rather than being characteristic of chronic musculoskeletal pain patients in general.",2001,17,2,119-28,10.1097/00002508-200106000-00004,#3382,Spence 2001,
698,19387368.0,Predicting one repetition maximum equations accuracy in paralympic rowers with motor disabilities.,J Strength Cond Res,"Predicting one repetition maximum equations accuracy in paralympic rowers Resistance training intensity is prescribed using percentiles of the maximum strength, defined as the maximum tension generated for a muscle or muscular group. This value is found through the application of the one maximal repetition (1RM) test. One maximal repetition test demands time and still is not appropriate for some populations because of the risk it offers. In recent years, the prediction of maximal strength, through predicting equations, has been used to prevent the inconveniences of the 1RM test. The purpose of this study was to verify the accuracy of 12 1RM predicting equations for disabled rowers. Nine male paralympic rowers (7 one-leg amputated rowers and 2 cerebral paralyzed rowers; age, 30 +/- 7.9 years; height, 175.1 +/- 5.9 cm; weight, 69 +/- 13.6 kg) performed 1RM test for lying T-bar row and flat barbell bench press exercises to determine upper-body strength and leg press exercise to determine lower-body strength. One maximal repetition test was performed, and based on submaximal repetitions loads, several linear and exponential equations models were tested with regard of their accuracy. We did not find statistical differences for lying T-bar row and bench press exercises between measured and predicted 1RM values (p = 0.84 and 0.23 for lying T-bar row and flat barbell bench press, respectively); however, leg press exercise reached a high significant difference between measured and predicted values (p < 0.01). In conclusion, rowers with motor disabilities tolerate 1RM testing procedures, and predicting 1RM equations are accurate for bench press and lying T-bar row, but not for leg press, in this kind of athlete.",2009,23,3,1045-50,10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181a06356,#3383,Schwingel 2009,
699,16014404.0,Functional coupling of beta3-adrenoceptors and large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels in human uterine myocytes.,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,"CONTEXT: Beta3-adrenoreceptor modulation in human myometrium during pregnancy is linked functionally to myometrial inhibition. Maxi-K+ channels (BK(Ca)) play a significant role in modulating cell membrane potential and excitability. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the potential involvement of BK(Ca) channel function in the response of human myometrium to beta3-adrenoceptor activation. DESIGN: Single and whole-cell electrophysiological BK(Ca) channel recordings from freshly dispersed myocytes were obtained in the presence and absence of BRL37344, a specific beta3-adrenoreceptor agonist. The in vitro effects of BRL37344 on isolated myometrial contractions, in the presence and absence of the specific BK(Ca) channel blocker, iberiotoxin (IbTX), were investigated. SETTING: The study was carried out at the Clinical Science Institute. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Myometrial biopsies were obtained at elective cesarean delivery. INTERVENTION: No intervention was applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Open state probability of single channel recordings, whole cell currents, and myometrial contractile activity were measured. RESULTS: Single-channel recordings identified the BK(Ca) channel as a target of BRL37344. BRL37344 significantly increased the open state probability of this channel in a concentration-dependent manner (control 0.031 +/- 0.004; 50 microM BRL37344 0.073 +/- 0.005 (P < 0.001); and 100 microM BRL37344 0.101 +/- 0.005 (P < 0.001). This effect was completely blocked after preincubation of the cells with 1 microM bupranolol, a nonspecific beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, or 100 nM SR59230a, a specific beta3-adrenoreceptor antagonist. In addition, BRL37344 increased whole-cell currents over a range of membrane potentials, and this effect was reversed by 100 nM IbTX. In vitro isometric tension studies demonstrated that BRL37344 exerted a significant concentration-dependent relaxant effect on human myometrial tissue (P < 0.05), and preincubation of these strips with IbTX attenuated this effect on both spontaneous and oxytocin-induced contractions (44.44 and 57.84% at 10(-5) M, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings outline that activation of the BK(Ca) channel may explain the potent uterorelaxant effect of beta3-adrenoreceptor agonists.",2005,90,10,5786-96,10.1210/jc.2005-0574,#3384,Doheny 2005,
700,3921089.0,Effects of the C5a anaphylatoxin and its relationship to cyclo-oxygenase metabolites in rabbit vascular strips.,Br J Pharmacol,"Strips of rabbit blood vessels were suspended in vitro and responses to complement peptides C3a and C5a were recorded isotonically. Human C3a (up to 1.5 microM) was inactive on rabbit vascular strips. Human C5a (2.9-59 nM) decreased spontaneous activity of the rabbit portal vein under resting baseline tension. The C5a relaxed strips of portal vein and pulmonary artery that were precontracted with noradrenaline (NA, 200 nM). On the portal vein, C5a-induced relaxation was preceded by a transient contractile phase which decreased with repeated applications of C5a. The magnitude of C5a-induced relaxation of both vessels increased with repeated stimulation by C5a. Maximal levels of relaxation for the third application of C5a at 59 nM averaged 44% and 17% of the NA-induced contraction plateau in portal vein and pulmonary artery, respectively. Strips of rabbit aorta responded minimally to C5a. Indomethacin (5.6 microM) significantly inhibited C5a-induced relaxation of the portal vein and pulmonary artery but had no effect on the early contractile response of the portal vein. Mepyramine (10 microM) failed to modify the C5a response from either vessel, but it reduced the contractile phase of the C5a response on the portal vein when applied in conjunction with indomethacin. The drug SKF 88046, an end organ antagonist of thromboxane (TX) A2 and some contractile prostaglandins, reduced the contractile phase and increased relaxation of the portal vein to C5a but did not modify the response of the pulmonary artery. Radioimmunoassays for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and TXB2 were performed on the fluid bathing rabbit isolated blood vessels. C5a promoted release of 6-keto-PGF1, over the basal release rate in rabbit tissues. Only trace quantities of TXB2 were produced by rabbit vessels exposed to C5a. 7 It is concluded that the mechanical response of blood vessels to C5a is mainly determined by the type of cyclo-oxygenase products released and by the sensitivity of each blood vessel to these active lipids. Tissue histamine release is also responsible for a component of the response of rabbit portal vein to C5a. The relaxant effect of C5a on rabbit blood vessels may be a phenomenon related to the previously reported hypotensive action of classical anaphylatoxins in vivo.",1985,84,3,725-33,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1985.tb16155.x,#3385,Hugli 1985,
701,15902147.0,The hidden epidemic of pelvic floor dysfunction: achievable goals for improved prevention and treatment.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"Each year, pelvic floor dysfunction affects between 300,000 and 400,000 American women so severely that they require surgery. Approximately 30% of the operations performed are re-operations. The high prevalence of this problem indicates the need for preventive strategies, and the common occurrence of re-operation indicates the need for treatment improvement. Efforts at prevention and treatment improvement will only be possible if research clarifies causative mechanisms and scientifically valid studies discover why operations fail. By reaching a goal of 25% prevention we could save 90,000 women from experiencing pelvic floor dysfunction and with 25% treatment improvement we could avoid 30,000 women from needing a second operation. To achieve these goals we must discover specific events or behaviors in a woman's life that lead to these problems and that are amenable to preventive strategies. In addition, we must define specific biologic and behavioral factors that explain why certain women have recurrence after surgery. Because the pelvic organ support system is comprised of muscles, ligaments, and nerves arranged in a complex tension-based apparatus, the basic nature of this work must include biomechanical analyses of the overall mechanism and targeted research into the biology of muscle, ligament, nerve, and their complex interactions in normal pelvic floor function and in symptomatic patient. Each of these scientific disciplines is well developed so that engaging scientists in the effort to move forward will bring predictably important results. With an integrated approach to this problem over the next 20 years, it should be possible to achieve these goals and reduce the suffering for more than 100,000 afflicted women.",2005,192,5,1488-95,10.1016/j.ajog.2005.02.028,#3386,DeLancey 2005,
702,3797421.0,Platelet-activating factor contracts human myometrium in vitro.,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"The myometrial contractile responses to synthetic 1-0-octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine (platelet-activating factor, PAF) and to oxytocin were evaluated in vitro on uterine (lower segment) strips obtained from pregnant women at term (39th week), undergoing elective cesarean section. Contractility was measured isometrically in an isolated organ bath using a superfusion technique. PAF in a concentration range between 5 and 100 nM as well as oxytocin (0.1-10 mU/ml) induced a dose-dependent contraction which could be categorized in two patterns, depending on whether spontaneous activity was present. In resting strips, oxytocin induced a prompt (0.5-1 min) development of active tension, followed by a prolonged (6-18 min), slow contraction and a final relaxation. However, at variance with oxytocin, PAF-induced contractions were rhythmic (3-8/hr), and characterized by a prompt (0.5-2 min) development of tension, followed by a brief (0.5-2 min) plateau, and a final, rapid relaxation. In spontaneously active strips, both stimuli induced a marked potentiation of the contractile activity. PAF response was dependent on both cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived products as inferred from the abrogating effects of indomethacin and FPL 55712. A receptor-mediated mechanism of action was inferred from the occurrence of specific desensitization to PAF (but not to oxytocin), and from the blocking effect of CV 3988, a specific PAF receptor antagonist. The present study indicates that PAF stimulates the contraction of human myometrium in vitro and suggests that this mediator may have a role in labor.",1986,183,3,376-81,10.3181/00379727-183-42435,#3387,Tetta 1986,
703,34857921.0,Nuclear deformation guides chromatin reorganization in cardiac development and disease.,Nat Biomed Eng,"In cardiovascular tissues, changes in the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix are associated with cellular de-differentiation and with subsequent functional declines. However, the underlying mechanoreceptive mechanisms are largely unclear. Here, by generating high-resolution, full-field strain maps of cardiomyocyte nuclei during contraction in vitro, complemented with evidence from tissues from patients with cardiomyopathy and from mice with reduced cardiac performance, we show that cardiomyocytes establish a distinct nuclear organization during maturation, characterized by the reorganization of H3K9me3-marked chromatin towards the nuclear border. Specifically, we show that intranuclear tension is spatially correlated with H3K9me3-marked chromatin, that reductions in nuclear deformation (through environmental stiffening or through the disruption of complexes of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) abrogate chromatin reorganization and lead to the dissociation of H3K9me3-marked chromatin from the nuclear periphery, and that the suppression of H3K9 methylation induces chromatin reorganization and reduces the expression of cardiac developmental genes. Overall, our findings indicate that, by integrating environmental mechanical cues, the nuclei of cardiomyocytes guide and stabilize the fate of cells through the reorganization of epigenetically marked chromatin.",2021,5,12,1500-1516,10.1038/s41551-021-00823-9,#3388,Seelbinder 2021,
704,6219332.0,Biology of cardiac overload.,Pathobiol Annu,"Mechanical overload in the heart induces two different types of adaptational mechanisms. (a) From a qualitative point of view, the maximum speed of shortening is depressed in relation to a myosin isoenzymic change responsible for decreased ATPase and, although the relaxation appears normal from a physiological point of view, the existence of an abnormality in Ca2+ uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been well documented. Both of these processes appear to improve efficiency by decreasing the heat produced per gram of tension. The existence of a large broadening of the action potential has now been well established, but it remains unexplained at the biochemical level. The functioning of mitochondria is rather controversial, and although it has been shown that they are both more abundant and smaller, the reason why their respiratory index changes remains unknown. (b) From a quantitative point of view, the adult heart adapts to overload by increasing its mass. This is mainly a consequence of a hypertrophy of the myocytes and a mitotic multiplication of nonmuscular cells. Data suggest that myocyte amitotic divisions may occur, at least in humans, and perhaps in very sizeable experimental hypertrophy. To this phenomenon has been added the development of polyploidy of myocyte nuclei, which seems to be specific to certain species. The stimulation of protein synthesis occurs very soon after pressure overload, and is delayed in volume overload; protein lysis also increases, although this is controversial. The process occurs whatever the proteins. This is accompanied by increased nuclear activity and a stimulation in RNA synthesis, which is especially precocious for messenger RNA. Among the very early events which could be potential signals for protein synthesis, attention has been focused on polyamine, RNA polymerase, and uridine kinase. The trigger mechanism, of course remains hypothetical. As a trigger for protein synthesis, several data suggest an increase in wall stress and stretch; a drop in efficiency is suggested as a trigger for qualitative changes.",1982,12,,137-83,,#3389,Swynghedauw 1982,
705,23144315.0,Impact of site-specific phosphorylation of protein kinase A sites Ser23 and Ser24 of cardiac troponin I in human cardiomyocytes.,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,"PKA-mediated phosphorylation of contractile proteins upon β-adrenergic stimulation plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac performance. Phosphorylation of the PKA sites (Ser(23)/Ser(24)) of cardiac troponin (cTn)I results in a decrease in myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity and an increase in the rate of relaxation. However, the relation between the level of phosphorylation of the sites and the functional effects in the human myocardium is unknown. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to study the effects of phosphorylation at Ser(23) and Ser(24) of cTnI on myofilament function in human cardiac tissue. Serines were replaced by aspartic acid (D) or alanine (A) to mimic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. cTnI-DD mimics both sites phosphorylated, cTnI-AD mimics Ser(23) unphosphorylated and Ser(24) phosphorylated, cTnI-DA mimics Ser(23) phosphorylated and Ser(24) unphosphorylated, and cTnI-AA mimics both sites unphosphorylated. Force development was measured at various Ca(2+) concentrations in permeabilized cardiomyocytes in which the endogenous troponin complex was exchanged with these recombinant human troponin complexes. In donor cardiomyocytes, myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (pCa(50)) was significantly lower in cTnI-DD (pCa(50): 5.39 ± 0.01) compared with cTnI-AA (pCa(50): 5.50 ± 0.01), cTnI-AD (pCa(50): 5.48 ± 0.01), and cTnI-DA (pCa(50): 5.51 ± 0.01) at ~70% cTn exchange. No effects were observed on the rate of tension redevelopment. In cardiomyocytes from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathic tissue, a linear decline in pCa(50) with cTnI-DD content was observed, saturating at ~55% bisphosphorylation. Our data suggest that in the human myocardium, phosphorylation of both PKA sites on cTnI is required to reduce myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity, which is maximal at ~55% bisphosphorylated cTnI. The implications for in vivo cardiac function in health and disease are detailed in the DISCUSSION in this article.",2013,304,2,H260-8,10.1152/ajpheart.00498.2012,#3390,Wijnker 2013,

The present study was performed to investigate the effects of muscarinic m2-receptor antagonists on trabecular meshwork contractility and to identify the m2 muscarinic receptor in human and bovine trabecular meshwork cells. METHODS: Isometric tension measurements of bovine trabecular meshwork strips were performed using a custom-made force length transducer. Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis was used to detect the m2-receptor proteins in membrane preparations of human and bovine trabecular meshwork cells. RESULTS: Immunoblotting results showed the expression of an m2-receptor protein band at 56 kDa in both human and bovine trabecular meshwork cells. Two different m2-receptor antagonists were tested on trabecular meshwork contractility. After carbachol-induced contraction (10(-6) M set to 100% contractile force), specific m2-receptor antagonists were applied. 3 alpha-Chloroimperaline (10(-6) M) had no effect on the maximal carbachol-induced contraction in trabecular meshwork strips. Methoctramine induced a significant relaxation at concentrations of 10(-7), 10(-6) and 5 x 10(-6) M even in the presence of m1- and m3-receptor antagonists. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that in addition to the m3-receptor subtype present in the trabecular meshwork this tissue also features the m2 receptor. This receptor is partly involved in the regulation of trabecular meshwork contractility, suggesting that outflow facility might be influenced through this receptor.",2001,239,4,310-5,10.1007/s004170100288,#3391,Thieme 2001,
707,9119800.0,Diverse inotropic effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine in heart muscles of various mammalian species.,Heart Vessels,"The inotropic effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on mammalian heart muscles were investigated. 5-HT (10(-8)-10(-3)M) produced increases in the contractile tension of atrial and ventricular muscles isolated from guinea pigs, Japanese monkeys, and humans, but not in rat heart preparations. The maximum percent increase of contraction was largest in guinea pig ventricular muscles (142.0 percent), followed by monkey atrium (86.3 percent), human atrium (71.7 percent), guinea pig atrium (48.7 percent), and monkey ventricle (30.1 percent). The sensitivity to 5-HT, measured as the negative logarithm of the half-maximal inotropic molar contractions of 5-HT, i.e., -logEC(50), was highest in the human atrium (6.65 +/- 0.20), followed by guinea pig atrium (5.53 +/- 0.36), monkey ventricle (4.83 +/- 0.28), guinea pig ventricle (4.56 +/- 0.11), and monkey atrium (4.46 +/- 0.16). The inotropic effects of 5-HT seen in the atrial and ventricular muscles of guinea pigs were abolished in the presence of the beta-receptor blocker, pindolol (8 mu M), while these effects in human atrial muscles and monkey atrial and ventricular muscles were abolished only in the presence of both pindolol (8 mu M) and of prazosin (1 mu M), an alpha(1)-receptor blocker. 5-HT increased the V(max) of the slow response recorded from guinea pig ventricular muscles exposed to high K+ (27 mM) media, whereas this agent did not alter the calcium current of isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes devoid of sympathetic nerve terminals. In reserpinized guinea pig hearts, 5-HT exerted no inotropic effect on ventricular muscle, yet it had an inotropic effect in the atrial muscle, although the latter effect was considerably depressed, compared to that seen in non-reserpinized atrial muscles. We conclude that the positive inotropic effects of 5-HT observed in the ventricular muscle of the guinea pig and in the atrial and ventricular muscles of the Japanese monkey can be attributed to the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve terminals (indirect effect). In contrast, in human atrial muscles, the positive inotropic effect of 5-HT was apparently the result of stimulation of a specific membrane receptor for 5-HT (direct effect). In guinea pig atrial muscles, both direct and indirect effects of 5-HT were involved in the positive inotropism. An explanation for the lack of sensitivity of rat atrial and ventricular muscles to 5-HT awaits further studies.",1996,11,1,7-Oct,10.1007/BF01744594,#3392,Zaizen 1996,
708,24216270.0,Statistical analysis of the reliability of acoustic and electroglottographic perturbation parameters for the detection of vocal roughness.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to verify whether the electroglottography (EGG) perturbation parameters could be superior indicators to traditional acoustic (Ac) measures, particularly for the detection of mild vocal roughness. METHODS: Thirty-nine participants with muscle tension dysphonia (the MTD group), 48 dysphonic participants with vocal fold lesions (the organic group), and 40 nondysphonic participants (the control group) were enrolled in the study. Based on the severity of vocal roughness, each of the two dysphonic groups was divided into mildly and severely dysphonic subgroups. The Ac and EGG signals during sustained /e:/ phonation were recorded simultaneously. The period and amplitude perturbation quotients of both signals (Ac-PPQ/-APQ and EGG-PPQ/-APQ) were calculated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to evaluate the discriminative capabilities. RESULTS: In the analyses between the control and each of the two dysphonic groups, the values of the areas under the curve (AUC) for EGG-PPQ were significantly higher than those for Ac-PPQ. Next, the ROC analyses between the control and mildly dysphonic MTD subgroup demonstrated that the AUC values for EGG-PPQ/EGG-APQ were significantly higher than those for Ac-PPQ/Ac-APQ. In the analyses of the mildly dysphonic organic group, the AUC value for EGG-PPQ was significantly higher than that for Ac-PPQ. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that both the period and the amplitude perturbation parameters of the EGG signals showed higher diagnostic accuracies than those of Ac signals, especially for the detection of mild vocal roughness. These results suggest that the EGG perturbation parameters could provide better information than the traditional Ac perturbations.",2014,28,2,263.e9-263.e16,10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.07.005,#3393,Hosokawa 2014,Electroglottography
709,27241246.0,Myogenic and metabolic feedback in cerebral autoregulation: Putative involvement of arachidonic acid-dependent pathways.,Med Hypotheses,"The present paper presents a mechanistic model of cerebral autoregulation, in which the dual effects of the arachidonic acid metabolites 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) on vascular smooth muscle mediate the cerebrovascular adjustments to a change in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). 20-HETE signalling in vascular smooth muscle mediates myogenic feedback to changes in vessel wall stretch, which may be modulated by metabolic feedback through EETs released from astrocytes and endothelial cells in response to changes in brain tissue oxygen tension. The metabolic feedback pathway is much faster than 20-HETE-dependent myogenic feedback, and the former thus initiates the cerebral autoregulatory response, while myogenic feedback comprises a relatively slower mechanism that functions to set the basal cerebrovascular tone. Therefore, assessments of dynamic cerebral autoregulation, which may provide information on the response time of the cerebrovasculature, may specifically be used to yield information on metabolic feedback mechanisms, while data based on assessments of static cerebral autoregulation represent the integrated functionality of myogenic and metabolic feedback.",2016,92,,7-Dec,10.1016/j.mehy.2016.04.024,#3394,Berg 2016,20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid

METHODS: A total of 16 healthy volunteers participated and, in a randomized order, received injections of glutamate (1.0 M, 0.2 mL) and isotonic saline (0.9%, 0.2 mL) in the masseter region that targeted subcutaneous, intramuscular, and bone surface tissues. Following injection, pain intensity was measured using electronic visual analog scale (eVAS) and numeric rating scale (NRS) scores of unpleasantness, tiredness, tension, soreness, and stiffness. Pressure pain sensitivity (PPS), pain drawing areas, and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) scores were also assessed. Repeated-measures analysis of variance, McNemar test, and Tukey post hoc tests were used for statistical analyses. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, subcutaneous injections induced significantly more unpleasantness and pain than intramuscular injections, and PPS scores evoked after glutamate injection at the surface of the bone were significantly higher than after intramuscular glutamate injection. Subcutaneous glutamate injections were more often described as ""sharp"" and ""pinching."" CONCLUSION: The subcutaneous injection was more painful and unpleasant than the intramuscular injection. The glutamate injection at the surface of the bone sensitized the deep pain tissues to pressure stimulation. Clinically, it may be difficult to differentiate between the source or site of pain originating from the masseter region, but the specific quality and word descriptors could assist in differential diagnosis.",2018,32,4,418-427,10.11607/ofph.2042,#3395,Udagawa 2018,
711,9609579.0,Activation of large-conductance potassium channels in pregnant human myometrium by pinacidil.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effects of the potassium-channel opener pinacidil on single uterine potassium channels and the contribution of the latter to pinacidil-induced myometrial relaxation. STUDY DESIGN: Myometrial strips and freshly dispersed uterine myocytes were prepared from the myometrial biopsy samples of women undergoing elective, nonlabor caesarean section at term gestation. RESULTS: In isometric tension experiments pinacidil potently relaxed pregnant nonlabor human myometrial strips, with an agonist concentration yielding the half maximal response of 0.4 +/- 0.1 micromol/L. This effect was antagonized by 500 nmol/L charybdotoxin. Application of 10 micromol/L glibenclamide also inhibited the pinacidil-induced relaxation. Coapplication of charybdotoxin (500 nmol/L) and glibenclamide (10 micromol/L) produced a biphasic curve, which was fitted to a two-site model with values for agonist concentration yielding the half maximal response of 0.6 +/- 0.2 micromol/L and 189.7 +/- 0.8 micromol/L. Large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium channel activity was dramatically increased after application of pinacidil (between 10 and 100 micromol/L) to both inside-out and outside-out patches. The activation required the presence of calcium ions at the intracellular aspect of the membrane. Charybdotoxin but not glibenclamide blocked pinacidil-induced unitary large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium channel activity. CONCLUSION: Pinacidil-mediated relaxation of human pregnant myometrial strips may be partially attributable to the opening of uterine large-conductance calcium-dependent potassium channels in addition to adenosine triphosphate potassium channel activation. Drugs with specific potassium channel-activating properties may have important clinical application as novel tocolytics in the treatment of preterm labor.",1998,178,5,1027-34,10.1016/s0002-9378(98)70543-5,#3396,Khan 1998,
712,22843785.0,Redox-sensitive sulfenic acid modification regulates surface expression of the cardiovascular voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5.,Circ Res,"RATIONALE: Kv1.5 (KCNA5) is expressed in the heart, where it underlies the I(Kur) current that controls atrial repolarization, and in the pulmonary vasculature, where it regulates vessel contractility in response to changes in oxygen tension. Atrial fibrillation and hypoxic pulmonary hypertension are characterized by downregulation of Kv1.5 protein expression, as well as with oxidative stress. Formation of sulfenic acid on cysteine residues of proteins is an important, dynamic mechanism for protein regulation under oxidative stress. Kv1.5 is widely reported to be redox-sensitive, and the channel possesses 6 potentially redox-sensitive intracellular cysteines. We therefore hypothesized that sulfenic acid modification of the channel itself may regulate Kv1.5 in response to oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how oxidative stress, via redox-sensitive modification of the channel with sulfenic acid, regulates trafficking and expression of Kv1.5. METHODS AND RESULTS: Labeling studies with the sulfenic acid-specific probe DAz and horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin Western blotting demonstrated a global increase in sulfenic acid-modified proteins in human patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as sulfenic acid modification to Kv1.5 in the heart. Further studies showed that Kv1.5 is modified with sulfenic acid on a single COOH-terminal cysteine (C581), and the level of sulfenic acid increases in response to oxidant exposure. Using live-cell immunofluorescence and whole-cell voltage-clamping, we found that modification of this cysteine is necessary and sufficient to reduce channel surface expression, promote its internalization, and block channel recycling back to the cell surface. Moreover, Western blotting demonstrated that sulfenic acid modification is a trigger for channel degradation under prolonged oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfenic acid modification to proteins, which is elevated in diseased human heart, regulates Kv1.5 channel surface expression and stability under oxidative stress and diverts channel from a recycling pathway to degradation. This provides a molecular mechanism linking oxidative stress and downregulation of channel expression observed in cardiovascular diseases.",2012,111,7,842-53,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.111.263525,#3397,Svoboda 2012,
713,10411579.0,Interspecies differences in the cardiac negative inotropic effects of beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of three preferential (BRL 37344, SR 58611, CL 316 243) and a partial (CGP 12177) beta-adrenoceptor (beta(3)-AR) agonists on the contractility of ventricular strips sampled from various mammalian species including humans. In the human heart, all beta(3)-AR agonists tested decreased contractility by 40 to 60% below control with an order of potency: BRL 37344 > CL 316 243 = SR 58611 >> CGP 12177. In the dog, the negative inotropic effects produced by beta(3)-AR stimulation were less pronounced than in humans, approximately 30% below control. The order of potency of beta(3)-AR agonists was CGP 12177 > BRL 37344 = SR 58611 >> CL 316 243; i.e., very different from that observed in humans. In rat, only BRL 37344 was efficient to decrease contractility. In guinea pig, only CL 316 243 significantly reduced peak tension. In both species, the reduction in peak tension did not exceed 20 to 30%. Finally, in the ferret, none of the agonists tested induced a negative inotropic effect. In dog, the negative inotropic effects of CGP 12177 were not modified by nadolol, but were abolished by bupranolol, a beta(1-3)-AR. beta(3)-AR transcripts were detected in the dog but not in the rat ventricle by using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. We conclude that cardiac negative inotropic effects related to beta(3)-AR agonist stimulation vary markedly depending on the species. A comparable interspecies variation previously has been reported concerning the lipolytic effects of beta(3)-AR agonist stimulation. Our study demonstrates that the pharmacological profile of a beta(3)-AR agonist on the human myocardium cannot be extrapolated from usual animal models.",1999,290,2,687-93,,#3398,Gauthier 1999,

In this study, we investigated the role of the related acetyltransferases p300 and cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) in skeletal muscle transcriptional homeostasis and physiology in adult mice. METHODS: Mice with skeletal muscle-specific and inducible knockout of p300 and CBP (PCKO) were generated by crossing mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase expressed under the human α-skeletal actin promoter with mice having LoxP sites flanking exon 9 of the Ep300 and Crebbp genes. Knockout of PCKO was induced at 13-15 weeks of age via oral gavage of tamoxifen for 5 days to both PCKO and littermate control [wildtype (WT)] mice. Body composition, food intake, and muscle function were assessed on day 0 (D0) through 5 (D5). Microarray and tandem mass tag mass spectrometry analyses were performed to assess global RNA and protein levels in skeletal muscle of PCKO and WT mice. RESULTS: At D5 after initiating tamoxifen treatment, there was a reduction in body weight (-15%), food intake (-78%), stride length (-46%), and grip strength (-45%) in PCKO compared with WT mice. Additionally, ex vivo contractile function [tetanic tension (kPa)] was severely impaired in PCKO vs. WT mice at D3 (~70-80% lower) and D5 (~80-95% lower) and resulted in lethality within 1 week-a phenotype that is reversed by the presence of a single allele of either p300 or CBP. The impaired muscle function in PCKO mice was paralleled by substantial transcriptional alterations (3310 genes; false discovery rate < 0.1), especially in gene networks central to muscle contraction and structural integrity. This transcriptional uncoupling was accompanied by changes in protein expression patterns indicative of impaired muscle function, albeit to a smaller magnitude (446 proteins; fold-change > 1.25; false discovery rate < 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: These data reveal that p300 and CBP are required for the control and maintenance of contractile function and transcriptional homeostasis in skeletal muscle and, ultimately, organism survival. By extension, modulating p300/CBP function may hold promise for the treatment of disorders characterized by impaired contractile function in humans.",2020,11,2,464-477,10.1002/jcsm.12522,#3399,Svensson 2020,Acetylation
715,12468637.0,Expression and regulation of endothelin-1 and its receptors in human penile smooth muscle cells.,Mol Hum Reprod,"We report for the first time that penile smooth muscle cells (SMC) not only respond to, but also synthesize, endothelin-1 (ET-1), one of the main regulators of SMC activity. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that, beside endothelial cells (EC), SMC of the human adult and fetal penis also express ET-1 and its converting enzyme, ECE-1. Accordingly, cultures of adult penile stromal cells express these genes. We also prepared and characterized penile SMC from human fetuses. These cells express SMC specific markers such as alpha smooth muscle actin and phosphodiesterase type 5A3 along with hallmarks of androgen-dependent cells (androgen receptor and 5alpha reductase type 2). Human fetal penile SMC (hfPSMC) are immunopositive for ET-1 and release ET-1. ET-1 expression in hfPSMC was strongly increased by several factors such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), ET-1 itself and prolonged (24 h) hypoxia. This latter condition not only affected ET-1 expression but also responsiveness. While at normal oxygen tension, hfPSMC responded to ET-1 with a decreased proliferation mediated by the endothelin-A receptors and TGF-beta1; however, during hypoxia, ET-1 stimulated cell growth. Accordingly, prolonged hypoxia up-regulated endothelin-B receptor mRNA expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that in penile tissues SMC produce ET-1 and that such production is modulated by factors involved in penile physiology and tissue remodelling. In addition, the hfPSMC we have characterized might be a useful model for studying biochemical aspects of the human erectile process in vitro.",2002,8,12,1053-64,10.1093/molehr/8.12.1053,#3400,Granchi 2002,
716,29614261.0,The novel CaMKII inhibitor GS-680 reduces diastolic SR Ca leak and prevents CaMKII-dependent pro-arrhythmic activity.,J Mol Cell Cardiol,"RATIONALE: Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was shown to increase diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca leak, which can result in delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered arrhythmias. Since increased CaMKII expression and activity has been mechanistically linked to arrhythmias in human heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF), specific strategies aimed at CaMKII inhibition may have therapeutic potential. OBJECTIVE: We tested the antiarrhythmic and inotropic effects of a novel selective and ATP-competitive CaMKII inhibitor (GS-680). METHODS AND RESULTS: Trabeculae were isolated from right atrial appendage biopsies of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) were induced by stimulation with isoproterenol (ISO, 100 nM) at increased [Ca](o) (3.5 mM). Interestingly, compared to vehicle, PACs were significantly inhibited by exposure to GS-680 (at 100 and 300 nM). GS-680 also significantly decreased early and delayed afterdepolarizations in isolated human atrial myocytes. Moreover, GS-680 (at 100 or 300 nM) significantly inhibited diastolic SR Ca leak, measured as frequency of spontaneous SR Ca release events (Ca sparks) in isolated human atrial myocytes (Fluo-4 loaded) similar to the well-established peptide CaMKII inhibitor AIP. In accordance, GS-680 significantly reduced CaMKII autophosphorylation (Western blot) but enhanced developed tension after 10 or 30 s pause of electrical stimulation (post-rest behavior). Surprisingly, we found a strong negative inotropic effect of GS-680 in atrial trabeculae at 1 Hz stimulation rate, which was not observed at 4 Hz and abolished by beta-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, GS-680 did not impair systolic force of isolated ventricular trabeculae from explanted hearts of heart transplant recipients at 1 Hz, blunted the negative force-frequency relationship (1-3 Hz) and significantly increased the Ca transient amplitude. CONCLUSION: The novel ATP-competitive and selective CaMKII inhibitor GS-680 inhibits pro-arrhythmic activity in human atrium and improves contractility in failing human ventricle, which may have therapeutic implications.",2018,118,,159-168,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2018.03.020,#3401,Lebek 2018,Antiarrhythmic drugs

Liuzijue Qigong is a kind of traditional Chinese Qigong exercises that Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners prescribe to individuals with COPD to strengthen the internal organs' function. Liuzijue Qigong was recommended for use in COPD rehabilitation, and some clinical trials indicate that Liuzijue Qigong would produce better functional capacity and quality of life of individuals with COPD. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the existing studies to assess effectiveness and safety of Liuzijue Qigong for the prevention or treatment of COPD in patients. METHODS: We will perform the comprehensive literature search in English and Chinese electronic database. The publication period will be from inception to the search date. In addition, the clinical trial registries, dissertations, informal publication, grey literature, reference lists of studies, systematic reviews, and conference abstracts will also be collected. Two reviewers will identify relevant studies, extract data information, and then assess the methodical quality by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Only randomized controlled trials comparing Liuzijue Qigong against other intervention or nonintervention will be included. Data will be synthesized by either fixed-effect or random-effect model regarding to a heterogeneity test. The routine lung function, arterial blood gas tensions, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, functional capacity, 30 seconds sit-to-stand test, respiratory function, maximal inspiration pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, airway resistance, and specific airway conductance will be assessed as primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes involved dyspnea, and fatigue levels, respiratory muscle strength, upper and lower limb muscle strength, handgrip strength test, and health-related quality of life and safety. Meta-analysis will be performed by using Cochrane's Review Manager software (version 5.3.5). RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide a high-quality synthesis and evaluate the efficacy and safety based on current relevant literature evidence of Liuzijue Qigong intervention for COPD patient. CONCLUSION: Our systematic review will provide evidence to determine whether Liuzijue Qigong is an effective and safe approach to prevention and treatment of COPD patients.",2018,97,40,e12659,10.1097/MD.0000000000012659,#3402,Guo 2018,
718,11181961.0,Cytoplasmic signaling pathways that regulate cardiac hypertrophy.,Annu Rev Physiol,"This review discusses the rapidly progressing field of cardiomyocyte signal transduction and the regulation of the hypertrophic response. When stimulated by a wide array of neurohumoral factors or when faced with an increase in ventricular-wall tension, individual cardiomyocytes undergo hypertrophic growth as an adaptive response. However, sustained cardiac hypertrophy is a leading predictor of future heart failure. A growing number of intracellular signaling pathways have been characterized as important transducers of the hypertrophic response, including specific G protein isoforms, low-molecular-weight GTPases (Ras, RhoA, and Rac), mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, protein kinase C, calcineurin, gp130-signal transducer and activator of transcription, insulin-like growth factor I receptor pathway, fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor beta receptor pathways, and many others. Each of these signaling pathways has been implicated as a hypertrophic transducer, which collectively suggests an emerging paradigm whereby multiple pathways operate in concert to orchestrate a hypertrophic response",2001,63,,391-426,10.1146/annurev.physiol.63.1.391,#3403,Molkentin 2001,
719,33313315.0,A Modified Surgical Method Combined with Blepharoplasty Design for Treatment of Xanthelasma Palpebrarum.,Biomed Res Int,"PURPOSE: Xanthelasma palpebrarum manifests as a yellowish placoid on the medial aspect of the upper eyelids, often in middle and old age. Aggravated lateral hooding of the eyelid might cause a deformity with conventional surgery, which appears to be more deficient on the medial side with excess hooding of the lateral skin. The authors suggest a novel surgical technique to solve this problem and reconstruct the defect appropriately. METHODS: From July 2017 to December 2018, our method of combining excision with blepharoplasty was performed on 8 patients, consisting of 15 lesions on the upper eyelid and 6 lesions on the lower lid. Lesion removal incorporating blepharoplasty incision was done. After resection, the orbicularis oculi musculocutaneous flap was widely elevated extending through the whole upper eyelid with the lateral flap first along with fat maneuver. The flap was advanced into the defect, with even distribution of tension, after lower flap fixation to the required height of the eyelid fold. Taping was done with a hydrocolloid bandage and kept for 2 weeks. RESULTS: The wounds were healed primarily, and no cases of recurrence, lagophthalmos, hypertrophic scar, pigmentation, or remarkable deformity were noted. All patients were satisfied, and the functional outcomes were excellent. Two patients had trivial complications specific to our method, that of triple fold and neo-Mongolian fold, which were simply revised later. CONCLUSIONS: This modality overcame the drawbacks of eyelid deformity observed in previous surgical methods, giving excellent results without any critical complications.",2020,2020,,4803168,10.1155/2020/4803168,#3404,Choi 2020,
720,6088139.0,A circulating IgG in Chagas' disease which binds to beta-adrenoceptors of myocardium and modulates their activity.,Clin Exp Immunol,"It has been shown that sera from chagasic patients with positive EVI serology could act in co-operation with complement or normal human lymphocytes as a partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist increasing the contractile tension and frequency of isolated rat atria, as occurs with IgG purified from chagasic serum. In this paper we demonstrated that IgG present in chagasic patients sera could bind to the beta-adrenoceptors of the heart and stimulate contractile activity of myocardium. The positive inotropic and chronotropic effect could be blocked by the specific beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist but not by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist. Chagasic IgG inhibited the binding of (-) 3H-DHA to beta-adrenoceptors of purified rat myocardial membranes behaving as non-competitive inhibitors. The reactivity of chagasic serum or IgG with beta 1-adrenoceptor was lost after absorptions with turkey red blood cells. In contrast, guinea-pig red blood cells were unable to remove the beta 1 reactivity of chagasic serum or chagasic IgG. This supports the specificity of beta 1-adrenoceptors of the chagasic IgG and the independence of beta 1-adrenoceptor reactivity in relation to the EVI system. Clinical specificity of the beta 1-adrenoceptor reactivity seems rather high in Chagas' disease since it was lacking in 14 individuals with other cardiopathies, such as ischaemic and rheumatic heart disease, even after heart surgery.",1984,57,3,679-86,,#3405,Borda 1984,

Cardiac fibroblasts modulate matrix turnover in response to biochemical and biomechanical cues, but the complex interactions between signaling pathways confound efforts to develop therapies for regional scar formation. We employed a logic-based ordinary differential equation model of fibroblast mechano-chemo signal transduction to predict matrix protein expression in response to canonical biochemical stimuli and mechanical tension. Functional analysis of mechano-chemo interactions showed extensive pathway crosstalk with tension amplifying, dampening, or reversing responses to biochemical stimuli. Comprehensive drug target screens identified 13 mechano-adaptive therapies that promote matrix accumulation in regions where it is needed and reduce matrix levels in regions where it is not needed. Our predictions suggest that mechano-chemo interactions likely mediate cell behavior across many tissues and demonstrate the utility of multi-pathway signaling networks in discovering therapies for context-specific disease states.",2022,11,,,10.7554/eLife.62856,#3406,Rogers 2022,cardiac fibroblast
722,17556658.0,Dilated cardiomyopathy mutant tropomyosin mice develop cardiac dysfunction with significantly decreased fractional shortening and myofilament calcium sensitivity.,Circ Res,"Mutations in striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-TM), an essential thin filament protein, cause both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two distinct point mutations within alpha-tropomyosin are associated with the development of DCM in humans: Glu40Lys and Glu54Lys. To investigate the functional consequences of alpha-TM mutations associated with DCM, we generated transgenic mice that express mutant alpha-TM (Glu54Lys) in the adult heart. Results showed that an increase in transgenic protein expression led to a reciprocal decrease in endogenous alpha-TM levels, with total myofilament TM protein levels remaining unaltered. Histological and morphological analyses revealed development of DCM with progression to heart failure and frequently death by 6 months. Echocardiographic analyses confirmed the dilated phenotype of the heart with a significant decrease in the left ventricular fractional shortening. Work-performing heart analyses showed significantly impaired systolic, and diastolic functions and the force measurements of cardiac myofibers revealed that the myofilaments had significantly decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity and tension generation. Real-time RT-PCR quantification demonstrated an increased expression of beta-myosin heavy chain, brain natriuretic peptide, and skeletal actin and a decreased expression of the Ca(2+) handling proteins sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase and ryanodine receptor. Furthermore, our study also indicates that the alpha-TM54 mutation decreases tropomyosin flexibility, which may influence actin binding and myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. The pathological and physiological phenotypes exhibited by these mice are consistent with those seen in human DCM and heart failure. As such, this is the first mouse model in which a mutation in a sarcomeric thin filament protein, specifically TM, leads to DCM.",2007,101,2,205-14,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.107.148379,#3407,Rajan 2007,
723,31520094.0,[Anesthesia in gastrointestinal endoscopy: peroral endoscopic myotomy].,Anaesthesist,"Idiopathic achalasia is a motility disorder of the esophagus characterized by a dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter, which typically manifests as dysphagia. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an interventional endoscopic procedure for achalasia, which was introduced in 2010. Although results from randomized studies comparing short-term and long-term safety and efficacy are yet to be published, POEM is regarded to be less invasive than the standard treatment of achalasia (laparoscopic Heller myotomy). POEM is the first endoscopic procedure routinely performed with the patient under general anesthesia. During the preoperative assessment particular attention must be paid to the specific fasting intervals and the risk of aspiration during induction of anesthesia. For the purpose of temporary surgical access, the integrity of the esophageal wall is deliberately interrupted to create a long submucosal tunnel. As a result, unwanted fistulas can arise between the esophageal lumen, the mediastinum, the pleura or the intraperitoneal cavity. Endoscopically insufflated CO(2) may escape into these surrounding compartments with subsequent systemic CO(2) accumulation, capnomediastinum, tension capnoperitoneum or pneumothorax. As a result substantial cardiorespiratory instability can arise. Thus, the attending anesthesiologist must be familiar with these typical complications and with specific emergency measures, such as compensatory hyperventilation, percutaneous needle decompression and thoracic drainage. The POEM procedure is a therapeutic innovation and interdisciplinary challenge. However, anesthesia standards of care have not yet been specified.

724,32776260.0,What factors determine the number of nonmuscle myosin II in the sarcomeric unit of stress fibers?,Biomech Model Mechanobiol,"Actin stress fibers (SFs), a contractile apparatus in nonmuscle cells, possess a contractile unit that is apparently similar to the sarcomere of myofibrils in muscles. The function of SFs has thus often been addressed based on well-characterized properties of muscles. However, unlike the fixed number of myosin molecules in myofibrils, the number of nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) within the contractile sarcomeric unit in SFs is quite low and variable for some reason. Here we address what factors may determine the specific number of NMII in SFs. We suggest with a theoretical model that the number lies just in between the function of SFs for bearing cellular tension under static conditions and for promptly disintegrating upon forced cell shortening. We monitored shortening-induced disintegration of SFs in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells expressing mutants of myosin regulatory light chain that virtually regulates the interaction of NMII with actin filaments, and the behaviors observed were indeed consistent with the theoretical consequences. This situation-specific nature of SFs may allow nonmuscle cells to respond adaptively to mechanical stress to circumvent activation of pro-inflammatory signals as previously indicated, i.e., a behavior distinct from that of muscles that are basically specialized for exhibiting contractile activity.",2021,20,1,155-166,10.1007/s10237-020-01375-8,#3409,Saito 2021,Cell biomechanics
725,34283863.0,Algorithmic extraction of smartphone accelerometer-derived mechano-biological descriptors of resistance exercise is robust to changes in intensity and velocity.,PLoS One,"BACKGROUND: It was shown that single repetition, contraction-phase specific and total time-under-tension (TUT) can be extracted reliably and validly from smartphone accelerometer-derived data of resistance exercise machines using user-determined resistance exercise velocities at 60% one repetition maximum (1-RM). However, it remained unclear how robust the extraction of these mechano-biological descriptors is over a wide range of movement velocities (slow- versus fast-movement velocity) and intensities (30% 1-RM versus 80% 1-RM) that reflect the interindividual variability during resistance exercise. OBJECTIVE: In this work, we examined whether the manipulation of velocity or intensity would disrupt an algorithmic extraction of single repetitions, contraction-phase specific and total TUT. METHODS: Twenty-seven participants performed four sets of three repetitions of their 30% and 80% 1-RM with velocities of 1 s, 2 s, 6 s and 8 s per repetition, respectively. An algorithm extracted the number of repetitions, single repetition, contraction-phase specific and total TUT. All exercises were video-recorded. The video recordings served as the gold standard to which algorithmically-derived TUT was compared. The agreement between the methods was examined using Limits of Agreement (LoA). The Pearson correlation coefficients were used to calculate the association, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 2.1) examined the interrater reliability. RESULTS: The calculated error rate for the algorithmic detection of the number of single repetitions derived from two smartphones accelerometers was 1.9%. The comparison between algorithmically-derived, contraction-phase specific TUT against video, revealed a high degree of correlation (r > 0.94) for both exercise machines. The agreement between the two methods was high on both exercise machines, intensities and velocities and was as follows: LoA ranged from -0.21 to 0.22 seconds for single repetition TUT (2.57% of mean TUT), from -0.24 to 0.22 seconds for concentric contraction TUT (6.25% of mean TUT), from -0.22 to 0.24 seconds for eccentric contraction TUT (5.52% of mean TUT) and from -1.97 to 1.00 seconds for total TUT (5.13% of mean TUT). Interrater reliability for single repetition, contraction-phase specific TUT was high (ICC > 0.99). CONCLUSION: Neither intensity nor velocity disrupts the proposed algorithmic data extraction approach. Therefore, smartphone accelerometers can be used to extract scientific mechano-biological descriptors of dynamic resistance exercise with intensities ranging from 30% to 80% of the 1-RM with velocities ranging from 1 s to 8 s per repetition, respectively, thus making this simple method a reliable tool for resistance exercise mechano-biological descriptors extraction.",2021,16,7,e0254164,10.1371/journal.pone.0254164,#3410,Viecelli 2021,
726,7573410.0,Maximum speed of shortening and ATPase activity in atrial and ventricular myocardia of hyperthyroid rats.,Am J Physiol,"The kinetic properties of the myofibrillar system of atrial and ventricular myocardia of hyperthyroid rats were analyzed by determining ATPase activity and maximum shortening velocity. Hyperthyroidism was induced by daily subcutaneous injections of triiodothyronine (0.2 mg/kg body wt) for 2 wk. The treatment induced a marked atrial and ventricular hypertrophy and, in ventricular myocardium, an isomyosin shift toward a homogeneous V1 composition. Skinned trabeculae and purified myofibrils were prepared from atrial and ventricular myocardia. Enzymatic assays on the myofibrils showed that both Ca-stimulated ATPase activity and Ca-Mg-dependent ATPase activity had equal values in atrial and ventricular myocardia. In skinned trabeculae during maximal Ca activations, force-velocity curves were determined by load-clamp maneuvers, and unloaded shortening velocity (Vo) was obtained with the slack-test method. Both maximum shortening velocities extrapolated from the force-velocity curves (Vmax) and Vo were significantly higher (+68 and +52%, respectively) in atrial than in ventricular preparations. Developed tension was significantly greater in ventricular preparations. Maximum power output was not significantly different. Previous findings (V. Cappelli, R. Bottinelli, C. Poggesi, R. Moggio, and C. Reggiani. Circ. Res. 65: 446-457, 1989) had led to the conclusion that variations in ATPase activity and shortening velocity of ventricular myocardium can be accounted for by changes in isomyosin composition. In this light, the present results suggest that 1) ATPase activity is equal in atrial and ventricular myocardia as the two tissues contain the same myosin heavy chain isoform, 2) the difference in maximum speed of shortening between atrium and ventricle might be due to the presence of tissue-specific isoforms of myosin light chains.",1995,269,3 Pt 1,C785-90,10.1152/ajpcell.1995.269.3.C785,#3411,Bottinelli 1995,
727,16413609.0,Rapid actions of aldosterone in vascular health and disease--friend or foe?,Pharmacol Ther,"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the enzyme 11betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which confers aldosterone specificity to the MR, are present in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. In several pathological conditions aldosterone promotes vascular damage by formation of reactive oxygen species. The effect of aldosterone on vascular function, however, is far from clear. By rapid non-genomic mechanisms aldosterone may cause calcium mobilization and vasoconstriction, or may stimulate nitric oxide formation through the PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway and thereby counteract vasoconstriction. Vasoconstrictor, vasodilator or no effects of aldosterone have been reported from studies on human forearm blood flow. Inhibition of MR with spironolactone improves endothelial function in patients with heart failure but worsens endothelial function in type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of the present review is to reconcile some of the apparently conflicting data. A key observation is that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species serve as physiological signaling molecules at low concentrations, while they initiate pathological processes at higher concentrations. The net effect of aldosterone, which stimulates ROS production, therefore depends on the ambient level of oxidative stress. Thus, in situations with low levels of oxidative stress aldosterone may promote vasodilatation, while at higher oxidative stress (high NaCl intake, pre-existing vascular pathological conditions, high oxygen tension in vitro) aldosterone is likely to be associated with vasoconstriction and oxidative damage, and in this setting inhibition of the MR is likely to be beneficial.",2006,111,2,495-507,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2005.10.010,#3412,SkÃ¸tt 2006,

At the start of those contractions, the amplitude of the surface electromyogram (EMG) was linearly related to the tension exerted; the amplitude of the EMG increased linearly throughout these substained contractions by a constant amount--about 30% of the maximum. During sustained contractions, brief, intermittent maximal efforts showed that strength declined linearly at all tensions. At 25% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), there was a linear fall in the EMG amplitude associated with the brief maximal efforts, but the fall in strength was more rapid than the fall in EMG amplitude. At 70% MVC, there was no fall in the EMG amplitude in response to the brief maximal efforts, while the muscle strength fell linearly.",1979,2,4,257-64,10.1002/mus.880020404,#3413,Lind 1979,
729,27199119.0,A myosin activator improves actin assembly and sarcomere function of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes with a troponin T point mutation.,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,"We have investigated cardiac myocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CMs) from two normal control and two family members expressing a mutant cardiac troponin T (cTnT-R173W) linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). cTnT is a regulatory protein of the sarcomeric thin filament. The loss of this basic charge, which is strategically located to control tension, has consequences leading to progressive DCM. iPSC-CMs serve as a valuable platform for understanding clinically relevant mutations in sarcomeric proteins; however, there are important questions to be addressed with regard to myocyte adaptation that we model here by plating iPSC-CMs on softer substrates (100 kPa) to create a more physiologic environment during recovery and maturation of iPSC-CMs after thawing from cryopreservation. During the first week of culture of the iPSC-CMs, we have determined structural and functional characteristics as well as actin assembly dynamics. Shortening, actin content, and actin assembly dynamics were depressed in CMs from the severely affected mutant at 1 wk of culture, but by 2 wk differences were less apparent. Sarcomeric troponin and myosin isoform composition were fetal/neonatal. Furthermore, the troponin complex, reconstituted with wild-type cTnT or recombinant cTnT-R173W, depressed the entry of cross-bridges into the force-generating state, which can be reversed by the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil. Therapeutic doses of this drug increased both contractility and the content of F-actin in the mutant iPSC-CMs. Collectively, our data suggest the use of a myosin activation reagent to restore function within patient-specific iPSC-CMs may aid in understanding and treating this familial DCM.",2016,311,1,H107-17,10.1152/ajpheart.00162.2016,#3414,Broughton 2016,contractility
730,22324796.0,Bronchial inflammation induced PKCζ over-expression: involvement in mechanical properties of airway smooth muscle.,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,"Protein kinase C variants (PKCs) have been involved in the control of airway smooth muscle (ASM) tone, and abnormalities in PKC-dependent signaling have been associated with respiratory diseases such as asthma. In this study, the role of atypical PKCζ in airway hyperresponsiveness was investigated, using an in-vitro model of TNFα-treated human bronchi and an in vivo guinea pig model of chronic asthma. Our results demonstrated that PKCζ-specific inhibition produced a significant increase in isoproterenol sensitivity in TNFα-treated bronchi and ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized guinea pig bronchi. The role of epoxy-eicosanoids, known to exert anti-inflammatory effects in lung, on PKCζ expression and activity in these models was evaluated. An enhanced PKCζ protein expression was delineated in TNFα-treated bronchi when compared with control (untreated) and epoxy-eicosanoid-treated bronchi. Measurements of Ca(2+) sensitivity, performed in TNFα-treated bronchi, demonstrated that treatment with myristoylated (Myr) PKCζ peptide inhibitor resulted in significant reductions of pCa-induced tension. Epoxy-eicosanoid treatments had similar effects on Ca(2+) sensitivity in TNFα-treated bronchi. In control and epoxy-eicosanoid-treated bronchi, the phosphorylated forms of p38MAPK and CPI-17 were significantly decreased compared with the TNFα-treated bronchi. An enhanced expression of PKCζ was ascertained in our in-vivo model of allergic asthma. Hence an increased Ca(2+) sensitivity could be explained by the phosphorylation of p38-MAPK, which in turn leads to phosphorylation and activation of the CPI-17 regulatory protein. This process was reversed upon treatment with the Myr-PKCζ-peptide inhibitor. The present data provide relevant evidence regarding the role of PKCζ in human and rodent models of airways inflammation.",2012,90,2,261-9,10.1139/y11-117,#3415,Morin 2012,
731,8242287.0,Smoking impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation of saphenous vein.,Br J Surg,"Samples of proximal saphenous vein were obtained from heavy smokers and non-smokers: 28 were obtained at varicose vein surgery and eight at infrainguinal bypass surgery. The veins were prepared for histological examination and for mounting in an organ bath to measure changes in isometric tension. Vein rings from both smokers and non-smokers responded equally to sodium nitroprusside, a reagent that acts directly on smooth muscle cells, undergoing 90-100 per cent relaxation. The mean(s.e.m.) maximum relaxation in response to bradykinin of rings obtained at varicose vein surgery was 50.0(5.3) per cent in non-smokers compared with only 31.6(2.2) per cent in smokers (P = 0.03). Similarly, in specimens obtained at bypass surgery the mean(s.e.m.) maximum relaxation in smokers was only 25.1(6.3) per cent compared with 48.4(4.1) per cent in smokers (P = 0.04). Relaxation in response to the bradykinin stimulus was abolished in the presence of L-nitroarginine methyl ester, a specific inhibitor of the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Preincubation of the vein rings with L-arginine, the precursor of EDRF, did not increase the vasorelaxation in smokers. The mean(s.e.m.) maximum relaxation in response to the calcium ionophore A23187 was 53.5(3.8) per cent in non-smokers compared with only 27.0(4.9) per cent in smokers (P = 0.01). The results indicate that heavy smokers have impaired release of EDRF in response to both bradykinin and calcium ionophore. This impairment may increase vasomotor tone, platelet aggregation and smooth muscle proliferation, thereby resulting in an increased risk of graft occlusion.",1993,80,10,1242-5,10.1002/bjs.1800801007,#3416,Higman 1993,
732,11241398.0,"Vasoactivity of the ventral aorta of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata), Atlantic hagfish ( Myxine glutinosa), and sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus).",J Exp Zool,"To determine if vascular smooth muscle from teleost and agnathan fishes expresses receptors for signaling agents that are important in vascular tension in other vertebrates, we exposed rings of aortic vascular smooth muscle from the eel (Anguilla rostrata), the hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), and the lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to a suite of putative agonists, including: acetylcholine, endothelin, nitric oxide, natriuretic peptides, and prostanoids. Acetylcholine constricted aortic rings from the eel, but had no effect on the rings from lamprey. On the other hand, endothelin constricted rings from all three species. Use of receptor-specific ET agonists demonstrated that only ET(A) receptors are expressed in the eel and lamprey aorta. The nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside or nitric oxide itself dilated rings from the eel, but both agonists constricted rings from the hagfish and NO produced a biphasic response (constriction followed by dilation) in the lamprey. Two natriuretic peptides, eel ANP and porcine CNP, produced marginally significant dilation in the eel aorta, human ANP dilated the hagfish rings, and pCNP and eANP dilated the lamprey rings. The prostanoids PGE(1) and PGE(2) both dilated the eel aortic rings, and PGE(1) and carbaprostacyclin (stable PGI(2) agonist) dilated the hagfish and lamprey rings. Our results suggest that receptors for a variety of vasoactive signaling agents are expressed in the aortic smooth muscle of the earliest vertebrates (lamprey and hagfish), as well as the more advanced teleosts (eel).",2001,289,5,273-84,10.1002/1097-010x(20010415/30)289:5<273::aid-jez1>3.0.co;2-l,#3417,Evans 2001,
733,1834555.0,Stretch-secretion coupling in atrial cardiocytes. Dissociation between atrial natriuretic factor release and mechanical activity.,Hypertension,"We investigated possible relations between excitation-contraction coupling and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) release in rat atrial muscle using the isolated perifused atria preparation. To this purpose, the extracellular ionic environment was manipulated by replacement of Ca2+ with the polyvalent cations Ba2+, Sr2+, and La3+. Intracellular Ca2+ was altered by treatment with caffeine and ryanodine and by chemical (49 mM K+) depolarization. Replacement of Ca2+ with Ba2+ or Sr2+ abolished atrial spontaneous mechanical activity but did not prevent ANF release. Chemical depolarization also abolished spontaneous mechanical activity and significantly reduced ANF release in Ca(2+)-free media and in 0.625 mM extracellular Ca2+ but had no effect in the presence of 1.25 or 2.5 mM Ca2+, suggesting that changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels do not affect ANF release in media containing Ca2+ in the physiological concentration range. The kinetics of ANF release observed during caffeine (10(-6) to 10(-2) M) treatment was similar to that seen in atrial preparations without treatment. At 10(-2) M, caffeine induced an increase in atrial beating rate and resting tension. Ryanodine (10(-4) M) pretreatment reduced stretch-induced ANF release by an average 34%, in addition to inhibiting tension development and beating. These findings clearly show marked differences between atrial cardiocytes and most other endocrine cells in terms of the effect of specific changes in the ionic environment on the secretory response; they also support the view that basal ANF release from atrial cardiocytes is not dependent on contractile atrial activity or Ca2+. In fact, Ca2+ appears to tonically inhibit the rate of basal ANF release. We conclude that, although indispensable for excitation-contraction coupling, intracellular Ca2+ transients by influx or from intracellular stores are not essential for basal ANF release. However, a ryanodine-sensitive compartment appears to be partly responsible for the increased ANF output after muscle stretch.",1991,18,5 Suppl,III169-78,10.1161/01.hyp.18.5_suppl.iii169,#3418,Kuroski-deBold 1991,
734,17306668.0,Expression and function of protease-activated receptor 4 in human myometrium.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the presence or functional effects of protease-activated receptor subtypes in human uterine tissues. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to investigate for protease-activated receptor-4 messenger RNA and protein expression in human myometrium, (2) to evaluate the effects of a specific protease-activated receptor-4 activating peptide (AYPGKF-NH2) on spontaneous human myometrial contractility in vitro, and (3) to examine the effects of a protease-activated receptor-4 antagonist (tcYPGKF-NH2) on thrombin-mediated uterine contractility. STUDY DESIGN: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Immunofluorescence studies were used to investigate for protease-activated receptor-4 messenger RNA and protein expression, respectively. Isometric tension recordings were used to examine the functional effects on contractility. RESULTS: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated messenger RNA expression for protease-activated receptor-4 in pregnant and non-pregnant myometrium. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrated the presence of protease-activated receptor-4 protein in myometrial cells. With the use of isometric recordings, protease-activated receptor 4-activating peptide elicited a stimulatory effect on spontaneous human pregnant myometrial contractility (13.1% +/- 2.7 SEM; n = 6; P < .05). Protease-activated receptor-4 antagonism alone elicited a significant uterorelaxant effect (14.7% +/- 2.4; n = 6; P < .05). The observed thrombin-mediated uterotonic effect was similar in the absence (46.1% +/- 12.8; n = 6) and presence (48.8% +/- 12.6; n = 6) of the protease-activated receptor-4 antagonist (P = .91). CONCLUSIONS: This study outlines protease-activated receptor-4 messenger RNA and protein expression in human myometrium. Protease-activated receptor-4 activation exerts a mild uterotonic effect, whereas protease-activated receptor-4 antagonism results in a mild uterorelaxant effect. The potent human uterotonic effect of thrombin is not apparently mediated to any great extent by protease-activated receptor-4.",2007,196,2,169.e1-6,10.1016/j.ajog.2006.09.027,#3419,Allen 2007,
735,30205918.0,Vocal Tract Discomfort Scale: Validation of the Argentine Version.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to validate the Vocal Tract Discomfort Scale (VTD) Argentine version. STUDY DESIGN: Nonrandomized, cross-sectional prospective study with control group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The VTD Scale was culturally and linguistically adapted to Argentinian Spanish according to the recommended requirements of translation, closely observing the methodology that was suggested (translation, summary, review and back-translation). The scale Argentine version (Escala de disconfort del tracto vocal) was administered to 107 patients with muscle-tension dysphonia (MTD) (23 men and 84 women, mean ages being: 32.30 ± 9.09 years old for MTD type I, and 31.23 ± 8.45 years old for MTD type II) and 30 volunteers with no vocal pathology (9 men and 21 women, mean ages being: 44.3 ± 8.72 years old). All patients completed the Escala de disconfort del tracto vocal before and after Mathieson Laryngeal Manual Therapy. The results of the VTD Scale administered in both patients and vocally healthy subjects were initially compared; the changes arising from pre and post therapy were also compared in the second phase. The internal consistency of the VTD Scale was assessed using Cronbach alpha coefficient. RESULTS: The internal consistency assessed was considered acceptable for both subscales within the VTD Scale. The values obtained for frequency, severity, and total score of the Scale were similar in patients with MTD I and MTD II, marking a difference with those obtained in the control group of healthy volunteers. A lump feeling in the throat was one of the most frequent symptoms in both MTD and vocally healthy groups. CONCLUSION: The VTD Scale shows an acceptable consistency, so it is a highly reproducible, reliable, and valuable instrument of evaluation to assess Argentinian patients with voice disorders.",2020,34,1,158.e1-158.e7,10.1016/j.jvoice.2018.08.004,#3420,Santi 2020,Language in Argentina
736,24698885.0,Correlation of VHI-10 to voice laboratory measurements across five common voice disorders.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: To correlate change in Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-10 scores with corresponding voice laboratory measures across five voice disorders. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: One hundred fifty patients aged >18 years with primary diagnosis of vocal fold lesions, primary muscle tension dysphonia-1, atrophy, unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP), and scar. For each group, participants with the largest change in VHI-10 between two periods (TA and TB) were selected. The dates of the VHI-10 values were linked to corresponding acoustic/aerodynamic and audio-perceptual measures. Change in voice laboratory values were analyzed for correlation with each other and with VHI-10. RESULTS: VHI-10 scores were greater for patients with UVFP than other disorders. The only disorder-specific correlation between voice laboratory measure and VHI-10 was average phonatory airflow in speech for patients with UVFP. Average airflow in repeated phonemes was strongly correlated with average airflow in speech (r=0.75). Acoustic measures did not significantly change between time points. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of correlations between the VHI-10 change scores and voice laboratory measures may be due to differing constructs of each measure; namely, handicap versus physiological function. Presuming corroboration between these measures may be faulty. Average airflow in speech may be the most ecologically valid measure for patients with UVFP. Although aerodynamic measures changed between the time points, acoustic measures did not. Correlations to VHI-10 and change between time points may be found with other acoustic measures.",2014,28,4,440-8,10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.10.023,#3421,Gillespie 2014,Acoustic
737,26708952.0,Mechanisms Involved in Thromboxane A(2) -induced Vasoconstriction of Rat Intracavernous Small Penile Arteries.,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,"Diabetes is associated with erectile dysfunction and with hypercontractility in erectile tissue and this is in part ascribed to increased formation of thromboxane. Rho kinase (ROCK) is a key regulator of calcium sensitization and contraction in vascular smooth muscle. This study investigated the role of calcium and ROCK in contraction evoked by activation of the thromboxane receptors. Rat intracavernous penile arteries were mounted for isometric tension and intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+) ](i) ) recording and corpus cavernosum for measurements of MYPT1 phosphorylation. In penile arteries, U46619 by activation of thromboxane receptors concentration dependently increased calcium and contraction. U46619-induced calcium influx was blocked by nifedipine, a blocker of L-type calcium channels, and by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, a blocker of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Inhibitors of ROCK, Y27632 and glycyl-H1152P, concentration dependently reduced U46619-induced contraction, but only Y27632 reduced [Ca(2+) ](i) levels in the penile arteries activated with either high extracellular potassium or U46619. MYPT-Thr(850) phosphorylation in corpus cavernous strips was increased in response to U46619 through activation of TP receptors and was found to be a direct result of phosphorylation by ROCK. Y27632 induced less relaxation in mesenteric arteries, H1152P induced equipotent relaxations, and a protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro-318220, failed to relax intracavernous penile arteries, but induced full relaxation in rat mesenteric arteries. Our findings suggest that U46619 contraction depends on Ca(2+) influx through L-type and TRP channels, and ROCK-dependent mechanisms in penile arteries.

738,17868356.0,Predictors of response to botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) in chronic daily headache.,Headache,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate predictors of response to botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA; BOTOX, Allergan Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) in patients with chronic daily headache (CDH). BACKGROUND: Chronic migraine (CM) and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) form the majority of CDH disorders. Controlled trials indicate that BoNTAis effective in reducing the frequency of headache and number of headache days in patients with CDH disorders. A recent migraine study found that patients with imploding or ocular types of headaches were responders to BoNTA, whereas those with exploding headaches were not. To date, there are no data on factors that might predict response to BoNTA in patients with CDH. METHODS: A total of 71 patients with CM and 11 patients with CTTH were treated with 100 units BoNTA. Every patient received at least 2 sets of injections at intervals of 12-15 weeks; fixed sites, fixed dose, and ""follow-the-pain"" approaches were used for the injections. A detailed medical history was taken for each patient in addition to recording Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores at baseline and every 3 months after each set of injections. Headache frequency was assessed throughout the study from baseline to weeks 24-27. Patients recorded the frequency, severity, and duration of headaches in Headache Diaries. Patients were divided into responders (> or = 50% reduction in both headache frequency and MIDAS scores compared with baseline) and nonresponders (< 50% reduction in either of the above variables). Variables analyzed for predictors of response include headache that is predominantly unilateral or bilateral in location, presence of cutaneous allodynia (scalp allodynia), and presence of pericranial muscle tenderness (also referred to as muscle allodynia). Chi-square analysis was used for parallel-group comparisons (proportion of CM responders vs proportion of CM nonresponders and proportion of CTTH responders vs proportion of CTTH nonresponders). RESULTS: In the CM group, 76.1% (54 /71) of patients were responders to BoNTA, of which 68.5% (37/54) had headache that was predominantly unilateral in location and the remaining 31.5% (17/54) had headache that was predominantly bilateral in location (both P < .01 vs CM nonresponders). Of the 23.9% (17/71) CM nonresponders, 76.5% (13/17) reported predominantly bilateral headache and in the remaining 23.5% (4/17) the headache was unilateral. In the CM responders group, 81.5% (44/54) had clinically detectable scalp allodynia, while pericranial muscle tenderness was present in 61.1% (33/54) (both P < .01 vs CM nonresponders). The presence of scalp allodynia and pericranial muscle tenderness in the CM nonresponders was 11.8% (2/17) and 17.6% (3/17), respectively. In the CTTH group where all patients (100%, 11/11) had bilateral headache, 36.4% (4/11) of patients were responders to BoNTA. All of those CTTH responders (100%, 4/4) had pericranial muscle tenderness (P < .05 vs CTTH nonresponders). None of the CTTH nonresponders had pericranial muscle tenderness. No clinically significant serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Mild AEs, eg, injection-site pain that persisted for 1-9 days, were reported in 11 patients. One patient had transient brow ptosis. CONCLUSIONS: A greater percentage of patients with CM responded to BoNTA than patients with CTTH. Headaches that were predominantly unilateral in location, presence of scalp allodynia, and pericranial muscle tenderness appear to be predictors of response to BoNTA in CM, whereas in CTTH, pericranial muscle tenderness may be a predictor of response.",2008,48,2,194-200,10.1111/j.1526-4610.2007.00914.x,#3423,Mathew 2008,
739,24509847.0,Myocardial infarction-induced N-terminal fragment of cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) impairs myofilament function in human myocardium.,J Biol Chem,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with depressed cardiac contractile function and progression to heart failure. Cardiac myosin-binding protein C, a cardiac-specific myofilament protein, is proteolyzed post-MI in humans, which results in an N-terminal fragment, C0-C1f. The presence of C0-C1f in cultured cardiomyocytes results in decreased Ca(2+) transients and cell shortening, abnormalities sufficient for the induction of heart failure in a mouse model. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the association between C0-C1f and altered contractility in human cardiac myofilaments in vitro. To accomplish this, we generated recombinant human C0-C1f (hC0C1f) and incorporated it into permeabilized human left ventricular myocardium. Mechanical properties were studied at short (2 μm) and long (2.3 μm) sarcomere length (SL). Our data demonstrate that the presence of hC0C1f in the sarcomere had the greatest effect at short, but not long, SL, decreasing maximal force and myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity. Moreover, hC0C1f led to increased cooperative activation, cross-bridge cycling kinetics, and tension cost, with greater effects at short SL. We further established that the effects of hC0C1f occur through direct interaction with actin and α-tropomyosin. Our data demonstrate that the presence of hC0C1f in the sarcomere is sufficient to induce depressed myofilament function and Ca(2+) sensitivity in otherwise healthy human donor myocardium. Decreased cardiac function post-MI may result, in part, from the ability of hC0C1f to bind actin and α-tropomyosin, suggesting that cleaved C0-C1f could act as a poison polypeptide and disrupt the interaction of native cardiac myosin-binding protein C with the thin filament.",2014,289,13,8818-27,10.1074/jbc.M113.541128,#3424,Witayavanitkul 2014,Contractile Protein
740,19806080.0,Potentiation of a functional autoantibody in narcolepsy by a cholinesterase inhibitor.,Lab Invest,"We have recently reported the presence of an immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibody (Ab) in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy that abolishes spontaneous colonic migrating motor complexes (CMMCs) and increases smooth muscle tension and atropine-sensitive phasic contractions in a physiological assay of an isolated colon. In this study, we used the cholinesterase inhibitor, neostigmine, to explore the mechanism of the narcoleptic IgG-mediated disruption of enteric motor function in four patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy and to identify a pharmacological mimic of the Ab. Neostigmine potentiated the narcoleptic IgG-mediated increase in smooth muscle resting tension and phasic smooth muscle contractions by an atropine-sensitive mechanism but exerted no effect on resting tension in the presence of control IgG. Decreased frequency of CMMCs mediated by IgG with anti-M3R activity was reversed by neostigmine. Therefore, a challenge with a cholinesterase inhibitor improves the specificity of the CMMC assay for narcoleptic IgG. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a neuronal sodium channel blocker, also abolished CMMCs and increased resting tone, and a similar potentiation was observed with neostigmine; thus, TTX is a mimic of the functional effects of the narcoleptic IgG in this bioassay. These findings provide a link to pharmacological studies of canine narcolepsy and are consistent with a functional blockade of both excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons by the narcoleptic Ab, similar to the TTX mimic, presumably by binding to an autoantigenic target expressed in both populations of neurons.",2009,89,12,1332-9,10.1038/labinvest.2009.108,#3425,Jackson 2009,
741,24829495.0,Non-weight bearing-induced muscle weakness: the role of myosin quantity and quality in MHC type II fibers.,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,"We tested the hypothesis that non-weight bearing-induced muscle weakness (i.e., specific force) results from decreases in myosin protein quantity (i.e., myosin content per half-sarcomere and the ratio of myosin to actin) and quality (i.e., force per half-sarcomere and population of myosin heads in the strong-binding state during muscle contraction) in single myosin heavy chain (MHC) type II fibers. Fisher-344 rats were assigned to weight-bearing control (Con) or non-weight bearing (NWB). The NWB rats were hindlimb unloaded for 2 wk. Diameter, force, and MHC content were determined in permeabilized single fibers from the semimembranosus muscle. MHC isoform and the ratio of MHC to actin in each fiber were determined by gel electrophoresis and silver staining techniques. The structural distribution of myosin from spin-labeled fiber bundles during maximal isometric contraction was evaluated using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Specific force (peak force per cross-sectional area) in MHC type IIB and IIXB fibers from NWB was significantly reduced by 38% and 18%, respectively. MHC content per half-sarcomere was significantly reduced by 21%. Two weeks of hindlimb unloading resulted in a reduced force per half-sarcomere of 52% and fraction of myosin strong-binding during contraction of 34%. The results suggest that reduced myosin and actin content (quantity) and myosin quality concomitantly contribute to non-weight bearing-related muscle weakness.",2014,307,2,C190-4,10.1152/ajpcell.00076.2014,#3426,Kim 2014,disuse
742,28049390.0,Assessment practices of Irish speech and language therapists in the evaluation of voice disorders.,Logoped Phoniatr Vocol,"It is commonly accepted that the evaluation of voice disorders ought to include extensive perceptual, psychometric, and instrumental measurements. This serves to encapsulate the wide-reaching effects of such a disorder, from the physical impairment in voice production to the psycho-social impact of having a dysphonic voice. In spite of this, no international gold standard exists by which voice disorders should be evaluated, and so speech and language therapists (SLTs) are often tasked with developing an assessment battery for use in their own clinics. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the evaluation of voice disorders by Irish SLTs on a national scale is suitably comprehensive, with particular reference to the guidelines published by the European Laryngological Society. A total of 49 SLTs working in a variety of settings responded anonymously to an electronic survey regarding their assessment practices. Results indicate that therapists are comprehensive in non-instrumental evaluation of voice, but lack both access to and training in instrumental assessment techniques.",2017,42,1,21-Dec,10.3109/14015439.2015.1121291,#3427,Kenny 2017,Assessment
743,28596100.0,Aerodynamic Patterns in Patients With Voice Disorders: A Retrospective Study.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: A recently published retrospective chart review of aerodynamic profiles of women with primary muscle tension dysphonia by Gillespie et al (2013) identified various relationships between mean airflow rate (MFR) and estimated subglottal pressure (est-Psub). The current retrospective study expanded the diagnostic categories to include all voice disorders referred for voice therapy. Three research questions were proposed: (1) Are there differences in the MFR and the est-Psub compared with the normal control group? (2) Within the disordered population, are there different variations in the pairing of MFR and est-Psub? (3) If these variations exist, are they diagnosis specific? METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients seen for acoustic and aerodynamic voice assessment at the Emory Voice Center between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014, were examined for aerodynamic measures of est-Psub and MFR; of these, 192 met the inclusion criteria. Simple t test, two-step cluster analysis, and analysis of variance, as well as Tukey multiple comparisons, were performed using R and SPSS. RESULTS: Mean est-Psub was significantly greater in the group with voice disorder than in the control group (P value < 0.001). However, no statistical significance was found when comparing the MFR with the control group (P value <0.59). Nine possible pairings of MFR and est-Psub were found. Sufficient evidence was not found to detect significant differences in these pairings across diagnostic groups. CONCLUSION: With regard to the rate and interrelationships of MFR and est-Psub, the findings of this study are similar to those of Gillespie et al, that is, MFR and est-Psub are not determinate of diagnosis.",2017,31,5,545-549,10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.11.001,#3428,Gilman 2017,Aerodynamics
744,25759434.0,"Proteomic Analysis of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived, Fetal, and Adult Ventricular Cardiomyocytes Reveals Pathways Crucial for Cardiac Metabolism and Maturation.",Circ Cardiovasc Genet,"BACKGROUND: Differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to the cardiac lineage represents a potentially unlimited source of ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs), but hESC-VCMs are developmentally immature. Previous attempts to profile hESC-VCMs primarily relied on transcriptomic approaches, but the global proteome has not been examined. Furthermore, most hESC-CM studies focus on pathways important for cardiac differentiation, rather than regulatory mechanisms for CM maturation. We hypothesized that gene products and pathways crucial for maturation can be identified by comparing the proteomes of hESCs, hESC-derived VCMs, human fetal and human adult ventricular and atrial CMs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using two-dimensional-differential-in-gel electrophoresis, 121 differentially expressed (>1.5-fold; P<0.05) proteins were detected. The data set implicated a role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α signaling in cardiac maturation. Consistently, WY-14643, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonist, increased fatty oxidative enzyme level, hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential and induced a more organized morphology. Along this line, treatment with the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine increased the dynamic tension developed in engineered human ventricular cardiac microtissue by 3-fold, signifying their maturation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and thyroid hormone pathways modulate the metabolism and maturation of hESC-VCMs and their engineered tissue constructs. These results may lead to mechanism-based methods for deriving mature chamber-specific CMs.",2015,8,3,427-36,10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.114.000918,#3429,Poon 2015,PGC1alpha protein
745,20952413.0,Length-dependent tension in the failing heart and the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy.,Cardiovasc Res,"AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has emerged as one of the few effective and safe treatments for heart failure. However, identifying patients that will benefit from CRT remains controversial. The dependence of CRT efficacy on organ and cellular scale mechanisms was investigated in a patient-specific computer model to identify novel patient selection criteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: A biophysically based patient-specific coupled electromechanics heart model has been developed which links the cellular and sub-cellular mechanisms which regulate cardiac function to the whole organ function observed clinically before and after CRT. A sensitivity analysis of the model identified lack of length dependence of tension regulation within the sarcomere as a significant contributor to the efficacy of CRT. Further simulation analysis demonstrated that in the whole heart, length-dependent tension development is key not only for the beat-to-beat regulation of stroke volume (Frank-Starling mechanism), but also the homogenization of tension development and strain. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with effective Frank-Starling mechanism, the length dependence of tension facilitates the homogenization of stress and strain. This can result in synchronous contraction despite asynchronous electrical activation. In these individuals, synchronizing electrical activation through CRT may have minimal benefit.",2011,89,2,336-43,10.1093/cvr/cvq318,#3430,Niederer 2011,

The goals of the current study were to (1) test the agreement between CSID versus auditory perceptual measures of pre- versus posttreatment voice change, and (2) investigate whether change in scores is based on voice disorder or phonemic structure of sentence stimuli. METHODS: Forty patients with benign voice disorders produced sentences and a sustained /a/ vowel from the Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of Voice protocol before and after treatment. CSID was calculated, and overall audio-perceptual voice severity was judged by 7 blinded, trained raters using a 100-mm visual analog scale. Differences between CSID and audio-perceptual measures of voice change across voice disorder and stimuli, and correlation between change in CSID and perceptual rating scores were assessed pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: Across all subjects, there were significant correlations between CSID and perceptual ratings change scores (P < 0.001), and no significant differences in pre- and posttreatment change. Disorder-specific analyses indicated that all tested sentence/vowel contexts are effective measures for pre- versus posttreatment change in atrophy and paralysis cases. Acoustic versus perceptual measures of voice change were significantly correlated in lesion cases for the sentence ""How hard did he hit him"" and with all sentences combined. There were no significant findings observed for muscle tension dysphonia. CONCLUSION: CSID provides an accurate objective correlate to auditory-perceptual posttreatment change in overall voice severity ratings. Implications for outcomes testing and disorder-specific findings are discussed.",2018,32,2,169-176,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.04.018,#3431,Gillespie 2018,Acoustics
747,22893699.0,The small GTPase RhoA regulates the contraction of smooth muscle tissues by catalyzing the assembly of cytoskeletal signaling complexes at membrane adhesion sites.,J Biol Chem,"The activation of the small GTPase RhoA is necessary for ACh-induced actin polymerization and airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction, but the mechanism by which it regulates these events is unknown. Actin polymerization in ASM is catalyzed by the actin filament nucleation activator, N-WASp and the polymerization catalyst, Arp2/3 complex. Activation of the small GTPase cdc42, a specific N-WASp activator, is also required for actin polymerization and tension generation. We assessed the mechanism by which RhoA regulates actin dynamics and smooth muscle contraction by expressing the dominant negative mutants RhoA T19N and cdc42 T17N, and non-phosphorylatable paxillin Y118/31F and paxillin ΔLD4 deletion mutants in SM tissues. Their effects were evaluated in muscle tissue extracts and freshly dissociated SM cells. Protein interactions and cellular localization were analyzed using proximity ligation assays (PLA), immunofluorescence, and GTPase and kinase assays. RhoA inhibition prevented ACh-induced cdc42 activation, N-WASp activation and the interaction of N-WASp with the Arp2/3 complex at the cell membrane. ACh induced paxillin phosphorylation and its association with the cdc42 GEFS, DOCK180 and α/βPIX. Paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with βPIX were RhoA-dependent, and were required for cdc42 activation. The ACh-induced recruitment of paxillin and FAK to the cell membrane was dependent on RhoA. We conclude that RhoA regulates the contraction of ASM by catalyzing the assembly and activation of cytoskeletal signaling modules at membrane adhesomes that initiate signaling cascades that regulate actin polymerization and tension development in response to contractile agonist stimulation. Our results suggest that the RhoA-mediated assembly of adhesome complexes is a fundamental step in the signal transduction process in response to agonist -induced smooth muscle contraction.",2012,287,41,33996-4008,10.1074/jbc.M112.369603,#3432,Zhang 2012,
748,33781820.0,Amino terminus of cardiac myosin binding protein-C regulates cardiac contractility.,J Mol Cell Cardiol,"Phosphorylation of cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) regulates cardiac contraction through modulation of actomyosin interactions mediated by the protein's amino terminal (N')-region (C0-C2 domains, 358 amino acids). On the other hand, dephosphorylation of cMyBP-C during myocardial injury results in cleavage of the 271 amino acid C0-C1f region and subsequent contractile dysfunction. Yet, our current understanding of amino terminus region of cMyBP-C in the context of regulating thin and thick filament interactions is limited. A novel cardiac-specific transgenic mouse model expressing cMyBP-C, but lacking its C0-C1f region (cMyBP-C(∆C0-C1f)), displayed dilated cardiomyopathy, underscoring the importance of the N'-region in cMyBP-C. Further exploring the molecular basis for this cardiomyopathy, in vitro studies revealed increased interfilament lattice spacing and rate of tension redevelopment, as well as faster actin-filament sliding velocity within the C-zone of the transgenic sarcomere. Moreover, phosphorylation of the unablated phosphoregulatory sites was increased, likely contributing to normal sarcomere morphology and myoarchitecture. These results led us to hypothesize that restoration of the N'-region of cMyBP-C would return actomyosin interaction to its steady state. Accordingly, we administered recombinant C0-C2 (rC0-C2) to permeabilized cardiomyocytes from transgenic, cMyBP-C null, and human heart failure biopsies, and we found that normal regulation of actomyosin interaction and contractility was restored. Overall, these data provide a unique picture of selective perturbations of the cardiac sarcomere that either lead to injury or adaptation to injury in the myocardium.",2021,156,,33-44,10.1016/j.yjmcc.2021.03.009,#3433,LynchTL4th 2021,Heart failure
749,20487244.0,Expression of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase isoforms in human cavernous arteries: functional significance and relation to phosphodiesterase type 4.,J Sex Med,"INTRODUCTION: The cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (cAK) is considered a key protein in the control of smooth muscle tone in the cardiovascular system. There is evidence that erectile dysfunction might be linked to systemic vascular disorders and arterial insufficiency, subsequently resulting in structural changes in the penile tissue. The expression and significance of cAK in human cavernous arteries (HCA) have not been evaluated. AIMS: To evaluate the expression of cAK isoforms in HCA and examine the role of cAK in the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)- and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-mediated control of penile vascular smooth muscle. METHODS: The expression and distribution of phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) and cAK isoforms in sections of HCA were investigated by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The effects of the cAK inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS on the relaxation of isolated preparations of HCA (diameter > 100 µm) induced by rolipram, sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil were studied using the organ bath technique. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Investigate the expression of cAK in relation to α-actin and PDE4 in HCA and evaluate the effects of an inhibition of cAK on the relaxation induced by inhibitors of PDE4 and PDE5 of isolated penile arteries. RESULTS: Immunosignals specific for cAKIα, IIα, and IIβ were observed within the wall of HCA. Double stainings revealed colocalization of cAK with α-actin and PDE4. The expression of cAK isoforms was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The reversion of tension induced by inhibitors of PDE4 and PDE5 of isolated penile vascular tissue were attenuated significantly by Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the expression of cAK isoforms in the smooth musculature of HCA and its colocalization with PDE4. A significant role for cAK in the regulation mediated by cAMP and cGMP of vascular smooth muscle tone in HCA can also be assumed.",2010,7,6,2104-2111,10.1111/j.1743-6109.2010.01808.x,#3434,Waldkirch 2010,

METHODS: A cohort of 263 patients treated at our institution for vasectomy reversal between 1986 and 2010 was included in our study, and the literature was reviewed. Inclusion criteria were previous bilateral vasectomy and presence of at least two postoperative semen analyses; patients reporting pregnancy without a postoperative semen analysis were excluded. A double-layer, microscope-assisted, tension-free anastomosis vasovasostomy was performed approximating mucosa to mucosa and muscle to muscle with a 10-0 non-absorbable suture. A multivariate logistic regression backward stepwise model was used to predict combined success, and a predictive model was calculated with remaining variables. RESULTS: Mean age was of 41.6 years (SD 7.1); mean duration of obstruction 7.2 years (SD 6.7). On multivariate analysis, uni- or bilateral granuloma and Silber grade of I-III were variable identified predicting higher probability to success (OR 3.105; 95% CI 1.108-8.702; p = 0.031 and OR 4.795; 95% CI 2.117-10.860; p < 0.001, respectively).

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, within-participant repeated measures. METHOD: Thirty patients with vocal fold nodules, polyps, and cysts related to secondary muscle tension dysphonia participated in the study. The measures of interest and videostroboscopy examination were used before and after treatment. The Global Perceived Effect questionnaire was used to separate those improved (moderately or greatly improved) and stable (slightly improved) patients. RESULTS: The mean standardized response, standardized effect size, and Guyatt analyses indicated high internal responsiveness for the all target parameters of the ATSHA, total score of the VHI, and two parameters of the Praat (0.8<). There was poor correlation between the videostroboscopy and the other target scales (r (Pearson) = -0.1-0.1). The receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that all the target scales did not significantly separate those improved and stable subjects (area under the curve = 0), except for the overall severity and roughness parameters of the ATSHA scale (area under the curve = 1). CONCLUSION: This study recommends both the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice and the VHI scales to show voice therapy changes. The target voice scale changes were not able to predict the videostroboscopy changes as external standard. Furthermore, we recommend that the overall severity and roughness may properly classify those improved and stable patients.",2018,32,6,770.e21-770.e30,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.08.008,#3437,Khoramshahi 2018,External responsiveness
753,27836428.0,High-speed Imaging of Vocal Fold Vibration Onset Delay: Normal Versus Abnormal.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: Vocal fold vibration onset delay (VFVOD) is heard frequently in spasmodic dysphonia and in muscle tension dysphonia. VFVOD changes due to other vocal pathologies have not been investigated. VFVOD during sustained vowel production was estimated with high-speed video in 10 normal and 40 pathologic subjects (scars, vocal fold paralysis, vocal fold nodules, and polyps). Analysis of high-speed video was done using digital kymography. RESULTS: VFVOD can be divided into two portions. Pre-phonation delay (PPD) is the duration when the vocal folds are nearly approximated to the time of first observed oscillation. Steady state delay (SSD) is the time when vocal folds are observed to come into oscillation until steady state of oscillation is observed. Normal subjects have almost zero PPD with vocal fold oscillation observed before full vocal fold adduction. Pathologic cases showed prolonged PPD because of (1) false cord adduction, (2) prolonged true vocal fold adduction, and (3) delay to onset of vocal fold vibration. Normal subjects have SSD of three to five cycles before steady state. Pathologic states result in increased SSD. Causes for increased SSD include (1) slow ramping up to steady state, (2) partial vibration of vocal folds, and (3) diplophonia with alternating beats before achieving steady state. There are significant differences between normal and pathology groups in both PPD and SSD. CONCLUSION: VFVOD is elevated in pathologic states. This can be due to increase in PPD or SSD. VFVOD is an under-recognized phenomenon that may contribute to complaints of vocal fatigue and dysphonia.",2017,31,3,307-312,10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.08.020,#3438,Woo 2017,Dysphonia
754,9715734.0,Endothelin-induced contractions in placental arteries is mediated by both ETA- and ETB-receptors.,Acta Physiol Scand,"We have examined the contractile response to the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) in uteroplacental arteries from normal pregnant women in the presence and absence of specific ET-receptor antagonists and agonists, and the vasodilator nitric oxide. Segments of placental arteries (n = 97) obtained from 37 placentas immediately after delivery were mounted in organ baths superfused with Krebs-Ringer solution at 37 degrees C. The tension was recorded isometrically and registered on a polygraph. We found that the placental artery segments responded to ET with a dose-dependent vasoconstriction. Half-maximal response was obtained at 2.6 x 10(-8) M. At 10(-7) M, the contractile response was 52% of the maximum KCl-response. The ET-1 induced contraction at 10(-7) M was inhibited by 74% after addition of the ETA-antagonist BQ-123 (10(-6) M), and by 58% by the ETB-antagonist BQ-788 (10(-6) M). Both BQ-123 and BQ-788 almost completely abolished the response to ET (10(-7) M). The selective ETB-agonist IRL-1620 also elicited vasoconstriction in the placental artery with a half maximal response at 8 x 10(-7) M. On a molar basis at 10(-7) M, the contraction by IRL-1620 as compared to ET was 30-fold lower. The contractile response of IRL-1620 (10(-6) M) was inhibited by 99% by BQ-788 (10(-6) M). After pre-contraction of the placental arteries with ET-1 (10(-7) M), the vessels relaxed in response to the nitric oxide donor, nitroglycerin (10(-6) M). The present results show that ET-1 contracts placental arteries through both ETA- and ETB-receptor activation. Nitric oxide (10(-6) M) was able to relax more than half of the initial ET-1 contraction, indicating that nitric oxide may be an important vasodilator in the placenta.",1998,163,3,227-34,10.1046/j.1365-201x.1998.00368.x,#3439,Sand 1998,
755,34261856.0,Somatosensory Tinnitus Diagnosis: Diagnostic Value of Existing Criteria.,Ear Hear,"BACKGROUND: Tinnitus can be influenced by changes in somatosensory afference from the cervical spine or temporomandibular area, then called somatosensory or somatic tinnitus (ST). In 2018, a new set of diagnostic criteria for ST was agreed upon by a large group of ST experts. Currently, however, it still requires extensive and specific expertise to diagnose ST correctly. The next step in the development of easily applicable diagnostic criteria is to assess the diagnostic value of each individual criterion. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was, therefore, to further investigate the diagnostic value of these criteria, validate them empirically, and identify their sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: An online survey, questioning the presence of 12 diagnostic criteria for ST in a convenience sample of participants with tinnitus, was launched on the online forum Tinnitus Talk, managed by Tinnitus Hub. Participants were divided into three groups: a group with no somatic influence, a group with some somatic influence and a group with large somatic influence on their tinnitus. Chi-square tests were used to calculate differences between these groups. Afterward, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR), and pre- and posttest probabilities were calculated for each ST diagnostic criterion. For this analysis, all patients with some and large somatic influence were compared as one group to the group with no somatic influence. RESULTS: In total, 8221 participants filled out the online survey. As expected, the diagnostic criteria for ST are more prevalent in the groups with somatic influence, but the criterium of tinnitus modulation also often occurs in the group with no somatic influence. The simultaneous onset or increase and decrease of both tinnitus and pain complaints have the highest positive LR (6.29 and 10.72, respectively), next to the influence of certain postures on the tinnitus (+LR: 6.04). To rule out ST, the absence of neck pain or tension in the neck extensor muscles are most suited, as they decrease the posttest probability to 18% and 19%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The simultaneous onset or increase and decrease of tinnitus and neck or jaw pain and the influence of certain postures are most suited to use as a single criterion for identifying patients with a somatic influence on their tinnitus. On the other hand, the absence of neck pain or tension in the neck extensor muscles is valid criterion to rule out a somatic influence. Additional analysis is needed to identify clusters of symptoms and criteria to further aid ST diagnosis.",2022,43,1,143-149,10.1097/AUD.0000000000001105,#3440,Michiels 2022,
756,9315537.0,Troponin I phosphorylation in the normal and failing adult human heart.,Circulation,"BACKGROUND: In the failing human heart myofibrillar calcium sensitivity of tension development is greater and maximal myofibrillar ATPase activity is less than in the normal heart. Phosphorylation of the cardiac troponin I (cTnI)-specific NH2-terminus decreases myofilament sensitivity to calcium, while phosphorylation of other cTnI sites decreases maximal myofibrillar ATPase activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined cTnI phosphorylation in left ventricular myocardium collected from failing hearts at the time of transplant (n=20) and normal hearts from trauma victims (n=24). The relative amounts of actin, tropomyosin, and TnI did not differ between failing and normal myocardium. Using Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that recognizes the striated muscle TnI isoforms, we confirmed that the adult human heart expresses only cTnI. A cTnI-specific MAb recognized two bands of cTnI, designated cTnI1 and cTnI2, while a MAb whose epitope is located in the cTnI-specific NH2-terminus recognized only cTnI1. Alkaline phosphatase decreased the relative amount of cTnl1, while protein kinase A and protein kinase C increased cTnI1. The percentage of cTnI made up of cTnI1, the phosphorylated form of TnI, is greater in the normal than the failing human heart (P<.00). CONCLUSIONS: This phosphorylation difference could underlie the reported greater myofibrillar calcium sensitivity of failing myocardium. The functional consequence of this difference may be an adaptive or maladaptive response to the lower and longer calcium concentration transient of the failing heart, eg, enhancing force development or producing ventricular diastolic dysfunction.",1997,96,5,1495-500,10.1161/01.cir.96.5.1495,#3441,Bodor 1997,
757,16183871.0,Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion modulate pregnant human myometrial contractility.,Reproduction,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have the propensity to cause macromolecular damage with consequent modification of cellular function. We investigated the effects of two particular oxidants, superoxide (O2(-)) anions and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), on oxytocin-induced myometrial contractility using biopsies from women undergoing Caesarean section at term gestation. Isometric tension recordings were performed and concentration-response curves derived after addition of test agents. A maximal reduction in myometrial contractility to 27.2 +/- 4.5% of control was observed followed application of H2O2. The enzyme scavenger catalase (CAT) reduced the inhibitory effect of H2O2 but had little effect at 10-fold lower concentrations. Addition of dialysed xanthine oxidase +/- hypoxanthine significantly inhibited contractility to 23.8.0 +/- 4.2% compared with control. Pre-incubation with superoxide dismutase and CAT diminished this effect. The non-specific potassium channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride (1 mM), had no effect on myometrial contractility. We conclude that human myometrium is susceptible to the effects of ROS, which may be produced by reperfusion-ischaemic episodes during labour. Our findings could, in part, explain the weak or prolonged depression of contractions characteristic of myometrial dysfunction culminating in difficult labours.",2005,130,4,539-44,10.1530/rep.1.00437,#3442,Warren 2005,

Tension responses in isolated blood vessels, plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma Na+ and K+ concentrations were also determined. The maximal binding values (Bmax) for [3H]glyburide and [3H]PN 200 110 in homogenates of left ventricle, right ventricle, and brain were not significantly different after NTG administration (continuous or intermittent), as compared with control. Intermittent, but not continuous, NTG caused significant increases in beta-adrenoceptor densities in the left ventricle, as judged by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding (Bmax values: intermittent NTG 34.5 +/- 4.8, continuous NTG 24.4 +/- 2.6, placebo control 20.9 +/- 2.9 fmol/mg protein); Kd values for all ligands were not significantly altered by NTG administration. Both intermittent and continuous NTG increased the vascular contractile response to phenylephrine in isolated rat thoracic aorta. Slight reductions (two- to four-fold shifts in EC50 values) in thoracic aorta relaxant response to NTG were observed in both treatment groups as compared with control. Intermittent and continuous NTG administration caused selective changes in beta-adrenoceptor density and vascular response. These changes may contribute partly to the phenomenon of pharmacologic tolerance after chronic nitrate administration.",1993,22,4,600-8,10.1097/00005344-199310000-00014,#3443,Bauer 1993,
759,8922253.0,Evaluation of the regional responsivity to ryanodine of human myocardium from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and secondary cardiomyopathies.,Basic Res Cardiol,"The aim of the study was to compare the contractile response to ryanodine of human heart preparations taken from right and left ventricles of patients affected by idiopathic (IDCM) and secondary (SCM) end-stage dilated cardiomyopathies. Right and left ventricle myocardial strips were obtained from hearts of patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation and suspended in an oxygenated bath (T = 35 degrees C; stimulation frequency = 0.5 Hz). After an equilibration period, a cumulative dose-response curve for contractility (peak tension) was obtained with ryanodine (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 microM). Basal contractility was not significantly different between right and left ventricles or between IDCM and SCM preparations. Ryanodine reduced peak myocardial tension but failed to completely suppress it, even at concentrations which achieved maximum effect. Ryanodine effect still persisted after a 45'-60' washout. The concentration-effect curves from IDCM right ventricle, IDCM left ventricle, SCM right ventricle and SCM left ventricle were compared: IDCM left ventricle was less sensitive to ryanodine than IDCM right ventricle and SCM left ventricle, while no difference was detectable between SCM left ventricle and SCM right ventricle. Thus, the overall sensitivity ranking was: IDCM left ventricle < IDCM right ventricle = SCM right ventricle = SCM left ventricle. IDCM left ventricle showed, in addition, a biphasic response with a shift from negative to positive inotropic effect at concentrations higher than approximately 10 microM. These findings indicate that the cardio-depressant effect of ryanodine, a drug which interferes with intracellular Ca release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, differs quantitatively and qualitatively in IDCM left ventricle from both IDCM right ventricle and SCM left ventricle. This suggests that some specific alteration in the intracellular Ca signalling in IDCM exists and, from a methodological point of view, stresses the need for a ""bi-ventricular"" approach to studying biochemical and functional abnormalities of advanced congestive heart failure.",1996,91,5,361-6,10.1007/BF00788715,#3444,Padrini 1996,
760,31049579.0,Absence of full-length dystrophin impairs normal maturation and contraction of cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells.,Cardiovasc Res,"AIMS: Heart failure invariably affects patients with various forms of muscular dystrophy (MD), but the onset and molecular sequelae of altered structure and function resulting from full-length dystrophin (Dp427) deficiency in MD heart tissue are poorly understood. To better understand the role of dystrophin in cardiomyocyte development and the earliest phase of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cardiomyopathy, we studied human cardiomyocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) obtained from the urine of a DMD patient. METHODS AND RESULTS: The contractile properties of patient-specific hiPSC-CMs, with no detectable dystrophin (DMD-CMs with a deletion of exon 50), were compared to CMs containing a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion of a single G base at position 263 of the dystrophin gene (c.263delG-CMs) isogenic to the parental line of hiPSC-CMs from a healthy individual. We hypothesized that the absence of a dystrophin-actin linkage would adversely affect myofibril and cardiomyocyte structure and function. Cardiomyocyte maturation was driven by culturing long-term (80-100 days) on a nanopatterned surface, which resulted in hiPSC-CMs with adult-like dimensions and aligned myofibrils. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that lack of Dp427 results in reduced myofibril contractile tension, slower relaxation kinetics, and to Ca2+ handling abnormalities, similar to DMD cells, suggesting either retarded or altered maturation of cardiomyocyte structures associated with these functions. This study offers new insights into the functional consequences of Dp427 deficiency at an early stage of cardiomyocyte development in both patient-derived and CRISPR-generated models of dystrophin deficiency.",2020,116,2,368-382,10.1093/cvr/cvz109,#3445,Pioner 2020,CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing
761,27743117.0,Stiff matrix induces switch to pure β-cardiac myosin heavy chain expression in human ESC-derived cardiomyocytes.,Basic Res Cardiol,"Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes hold great potential for in vitro modeling of diseases like cardiomyopathies. Yet, knowledge about expression and functional impact of sarcomeric protein isoforms like the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in hPSC-cardiomyocytes is scarce. We hypothesized that ventricular β-MyHC expression alters contraction and calcium kinetics and drives morphological and electrophysiological differentiation towards ventricular-like cardiomyocytes. To address this, we (1) generated human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) that switched towards exclusive β-MyHC, and (2) functionally and morphologically characterized these hESC-CMs at the single-cell level. MyHC-isoforms and functional properties were investigated during prolonged in vitro culture of cardiomyocytes in floating cardiac bodies (soft conditions) vs. culture on a stiff matrix. Using a specific anti-β-MyHC and a newly generated anti-α-MyHC-antibody, we found individual cardiomyocytes grown in cardiac bodies to mostly express both α- and β-MyHC-protein isoforms. Yet, 35 and 75 days of cultivation on laminin-coated glass switched 66 and 87 % of all cardiomyocytes to exclusively express β-MyHC, respectively. Twitch contraction and calcium transients were faster for CMs on laminin-glass. Surprisingly, both parameters were only little affected by the MyHC-isoform, although hESC-CMs with only β-MyHC had much lower ATP-turnover and tension cost, just as in human ventricular cardiomyocytes. Spontaneous contractions and no strict coupling of β-MyHC to ventricular-like action potentials suggest that MyHC-isoform expression does not fully determine the hESC-CM differentiation status. Stiff substrate-induced pure β-MyHC-protein expression in hESC-CMs, with several contractile parameters close to ventricular cardiomyocytes, provides a well-defined in vitro system for modeling of cardiomyopathies and drug screening approaches.",2016,111,6,68,10.1007/s00395-016-0587-9,#3446,Weber 2016,Calcium transients
762,24092256.0,Understanding the need of ventricular pressure for the estimation of diastolic biomarkers.,Biomech Model Mechanobiol,"The diastolic function (i.e., blood filling) of the left ventricle (LV) is determined by its capacity for relaxation, or the decay in residual active tension (AT) generated during systole, and its constitutive material properties, or myocardial stiffness. The clinical determination of these two factors (diastolic residual AT and stiffness) is thus essential for assessing LV diastolic function. To quantify these two factors, in our previous work, a novel model-based parameter estimation approach was proposed and successfully applied to multiple cases using clinically acquired motion and invasively measured ventricular pressure data. However, the need to invasively acquire LV pressure limits the wide application of this approach. In this study, we address this issue by analyzing the feasibility of using two kinds of non-invasively available pressure measurements for the purpose of inverse mechanical parameter estimation. The prescription of pressure based on a generic pressure-volume (P-V) relationship reported in literature is first evaluated in a set of 18 clinical cases (10 healthy and 8 diseased), finding reasonable results for stiffness but not for residual active tension. We then investigate the use of non-invasive pressure measures, now available through imaging techniques and limited by unknown or biased offset values. Specifically, three sets of physiologically realistic synthetic data with three levels of diastolic residual active tension (i.e., impaired relaxation capability) are designed to quantify the percentage error in the parameter estimation against the possible pressure offsets within the physiological limits. Maximum errors are quantified as 11 % for the magnitude of stiffness and 22 % for AT, with averaged 0.17 kPa error in pressure measurement offset using the state-of-the-art non-invasive pressure estimation method. The main cause for these errors is the limited temporal resolution of clinical imaging data currently available. These results demonstrate the potential feasibility of the estimation diastolic biomarkers with non-invasive assessment of pressure through medical imaging data.",2014,13,4,747-57,10.1007/s10237-013-0531-y,#3447,Xi 2014,
763,20065163.0,Molecular and functional characterization of a novel cardiac-specific human tropomyosin isoform.,Circulation,"BACKGROUND: Tropomyosin (TM), an essential actin-binding protein, is central to the control of calcium-regulated striated muscle contraction. Although TPM1alpha (also called alpha-TM) is the predominant TM isoform in human hearts, the precise TM isoform composition remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we quantified for the first time the levels of striated muscle TM isoforms in human heart, including a novel isoform called TPM1kappa. By developing a TPM1kappa-specific antibody, we found that the TPM1kappa protein is expressed and incorporated into organized myofibrils in hearts and that its level is increased in human dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. To investigate the role of TPM1kappa in sarcomeric function, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac-specific TPM1kappa. Incorporation of increased levels of TPM1kappa protein in myofilaments leads to dilated cardiomyopathy. Physiological alterations include decreased fractional shortening, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and decreased myofilament calcium sensitivity with no change in maximum developed tension. Additional biophysical studies demonstrate less structural stability and weaker actin-binding affinity of TPM1kappa compared with TPM1alpha. CONCLUSIONS: This functional analysis of TPM1kappa provides a possible mechanism for the consequences of the TM isoform switch observed in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure patients.",2010,121,3,410-8,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.889725,#3448,Rajan 2010,
764,27747368.0,Cardiomyogenesis of periodontal ligament-derived stem cells by dynamic tensile strain.,Cell Tissue Res,"Cellular therapies for the treatment of myocardial infarction have proven to be an invaluable tool in recent years and provide encouraging evidence for the possibility to restore normal heart function. However, questions still remain as to the optimal cell source, pre-conditioning methods and delivery techniques for such an application. This study explores the use of a population of stem cells arising from the neural crest and isolated from adult human periodontal ligament along with short-term mechanical strain as an inducer of cardiomyogenesis and possibly pre-conditioning stimulus for cellular cardiomyoplasty. Cells were subjected to a short-term dynamic mechanical tension in our custom-built bioreactor and analyzed for cardiomyogenic commitment. Mechanical strain elicited a cardiomyogenic response from the cells following just 2 h of stimulation. Mechanical strain activated and translocated cardiac-specific transcription factors GATA4, MEF2C and Nkx2.5, and induced expression of the sarcomeric actin and cardiac troponin T proteins. Mechanical strain induced production of significantly higher levels of nitric oxide when compared to static controls. Elimination of elevated ROS levels by free radical scavengers completely abolished the cardiomyogenic response of the cells. MicroRNA profile changes in stretched cells were detected for 39 miRNAs with 16 of the differentially expressed miRNAs related to heart development. The use of stem cells in combination with mechanical strain prior to their delivery in vivo may pose a valuable alternative for the treatment of myocardial infarction and merits further exploration for its capacity to augment the already observed beneficial effects of cellular therapies.",2017,367,2,229-241,10.1007/s00441-016-2503-x,#3449,Pelaez 2017,Cardiomyogenesis
765,16216962.0,Endogenous vascular hydrogen peroxide regulates arteriolar tension in vivo.,Circulation,"BACKGROUND: Although many studies suggested direct vasomotor effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in vitro, little is known about the vasomotor effects of H2O2 in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have generated mice overexpressing human catalase driven by the Tie-2 promoter to specifically target this transgene to the vascular tissue. Vessels of these mice (cat++) expressed significantly higher levels of catalase mRNA, protein, and activity. The overexpression was selective for vascular tissue, as evidenced by immunohistochemistry in specimens of aorta, heart, lung, and kidney. Quantification of reactive oxygen species by fluorescence signals in cat++ versus catalase-negative (catn) mice showed a strong decrease in aortic endothelium and left ventricular myocardium but not in leukocytes. Awake male cat++ at 3 to 4 months of age had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure (sBP, 102.7+/-2.2 mm Hg, n=10) compared with their transgene-negative littermates (catn, 115.6+/-2.5 mm Hg, P=0.0211) and C57BL/6 mice (118.4+/-3.06 mm Hg, n=6). Treatment with the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole increased sBP of cat++ to 117.3+/-4.3 mm Hg (P=0.0345), while having no effect in catn (118.4+/-2.4 mm Hg, n=4, P>0.05). In contrast, treatment with the NO-synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 mg.kg BW(-1).d(-1)) increased sBP in cat++ and C57Bl/6 to a similar extent. Likewise, phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in skeletal muscle, left ventricular myocardium, and lung was identical in cat++ and catn. Endothelium- and NO-dependent aortic vasodilations were unchanged in cat++. Aortic KCl contractions were significantly lower in cat++ and exogenous H2O2 (10 micromol/L)-induced vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that endogenous H2O2 may act as a vasoconstrictor in resistance vessels and contribute to the regulation of blood pressure.",2005,112,16,2487-95,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.105.543157,#3450,Suvorava 2005,
766,23684677.0,A novel paradigm for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: comorbidities drive myocardial dysfunction and remodeling through coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation.,J Am Coll Cardiol,"Over the past decade, myocardial structure, cardiomyocyte function, and intramyocardial signaling were shown to be specifically altered in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). A new paradigm for HFPEF development is therefore proposed, which identifies a systemic proinflammatory state induced by comorbidities as the cause of myocardial structural and functional alterations. The new paradigm presumes the following sequence of events in HFPEF: 1) a high prevalence of comorbidities such as overweight/obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and salt-sensitive hypertension induce a systemic proinflammatory state; 2) a systemic proinflammatory state causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation; 3) coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation reduces nitric oxide bioavailability, cyclic guanosine monophosphate content, and protein kinase G (PKG) activity in adjacent cardiomyocytes; 4) low PKG activity favors hypertrophy development and increases resting tension because of hypophosphorylation of titin; and 5) both stiff cardiomyocytes and interstitial fibrosis contribute to high diastolic left ventricular (LV) stiffness and heart failure development. The new HFPEF paradigm shifts emphasis from LV afterload excess to coronary microvascular inflammation. This shift is supported by a favorable Laplace relationship in concentric LV hypertrophy and by all cardiac chambers showing similar remodeling and dysfunction. Myocardial remodeling in HFPEF differs from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, in which remodeling is driven by loss of cardiomyocytes. The new HFPEF paradigm proposes comorbidities, plasma markers of inflammation, or vascular hyperemic responses to be included in diagnostic algorithms and aims at restoring myocardial PKG activity.",2013,62,4,263-71,10.1016/j.jacc.2013.02.092,#3451,Paulus 2013,ACEI
767,25749446.0,Cardiac hypertrophy reduction in SHR by specific silencing of myocardial Na(+)/H(+) exchanger.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"We examined the effect of specific and local silencing of sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) with a small hairpin RNA delivered by lentivirus (L-shNHE1) in the cardiac left ventricle (LV) wall of spontaneously hypertensive rats, to reduce cardiac hypertrophy. Thirty days after the lentivirus was injected, NHE1 protein expression was reduced 53.3 ± 3% in the LV of the L-shNHE1 compared with the control group injected with L-shSCR (NHE1 scrambled sequence), without affecting its expression in other organs, such as liver and lung. Hypertrophic parameters as LV weight-to-body weight and LV weight-to-tibia length ratio were significantly reduced in animals injected with L-shNHE1 (2.32 ± 0.5 and 19.30 ± 0.42 mg/mm, respectively) compared with L-shSCR-injected rats (2.68 ± 0.06 and 21.53 ± 0.64 mg/mm, respectively). Histochemical analysis demonstrated a reduction of cardiomyocytes cross-sectional area in animals treated with L-shNHE1 compared with L-shSCR (309,81 ± 20,86 vs. 424,52 ± 21 μm(2), P < 0.05). Echocardiography at the beginning and at the end of the treatment showed that shNHE1 expression for 30 days induced 9% reduction of LV mass. Also, animals treated with L-shNHE1 exhibited a reduced LV wall thickness without changing LV diastolic dimension and arterial pressure, indicating an increased parietal stress. In addition, midwall shortening was not modified, despite the increased wall tension, suggesting an improvement of cardiac function. Chronic shNHE1 expression in the heart emerges as a possible methodology to reduce pathological cardiac hypertrophy, avoiding potentially undesired effects caused from a body-wide inhibition of NHE1.",2015,118,9,1154-60,10.1152/japplphysiol.00996.2014,#3452,Nolly 2015,NHE1
768,10604953.0,Novel angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan prevents thromboxane A(2)-induced vasoconstriction in canine coronary arteries and human platelet aggregation.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"This study was conducted to investigate whether the novel orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan interacts with the thromboxane A(2)/prostaglandin endoperoxide H(2) (TxA(2)/PGH(2)) receptor in canine coronary arteries and human platelets. Coronary artery rings were isolated from male dog hearts (n = 18) and isometric tension of vascular rings was measured continuously at optimal basal tension in organ chambers. Autoradiographic binding of [(3)H]SQ29,548, a TxA(2) receptor antagonist, in canine coronary sections was determined. Blood for platelet aggregation studies was collected by venous puncture from healthy human volunteers (n = 6) who were free of aspirin-like agents for at least 2 weeks. Vascular reactivity and platelet aggregation in response to the TxA(2) analogs U46619 and autoradioagraphic receptor binding to the TxA(2) receptor antagonist [(3)H]SQ29,548 were studied with and without irbesartan. The TxA(2) analog U46619 produced dose-dependent vasoconstriction in coronary rings (EC(50) = 11.6 +/- 1.5 nM). Pretreatment with irbesartan inhibited U46619-induced vasoconstriction, and the dose-response curve was shifted to the right in a dose-dependent manner. The EC(50) of U46619 was increased 6- and 35-fold in the presence of 1 and 10 microM of irbesartan without a change of maximal contraction. At 1 microM, irbesartan is 2-fold more potent than the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan in the inhibition of U46619-induced vasoconstriction in canine coronary arteries. In contrast, neither AT(1) receptor antagonists (CV11974 and valsartan), the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319, nor the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril had any effect on U46619-induced coronary vasoconstriction. Irbesartan did not change potassium chloride-induced vasoconstriction; however, irbesartan did inhibit the vasoconstriction mediated by another TxA(2)/PGH(2) receptor agonist prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)). Neither the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester nor the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had any effect on irbesartan's attenuation of U46619-induced vasoconstriction. Irbesartan specifically reversed U46619-preconstricted coronary artery rings with and without endothelium in a dose-dependent manner. Irbesartan at high concentrations significantly competed for [(3)H]SQ29,548 binding in canine coronary sections. U46619 stimulated dose-dependent human platelet aggregation of platelet-rich plasma. Preincubation with irbesartan significantly inhibited platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, the dual antagonistic actions of irbesartan by acting at both the AT(1) and TxA(2) receptors in blood vessels and platelets may overall enhance its therapeutic profile in the treatment of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and arterial thrombosis.",2000,292,1,238-46,,#3453,Li 2000,
769,9516462.0,Regulation of iron regulatory protein 1 during hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation.,J Biol Chem,"Given the important relationship between O2 and iron (Fenton chemistry) a study was undertaken to characterize the effects of hypoxia, as well as subsequent reoxygenation, on the iron-regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) in a rat hepatoma cell line. IRP1 and IRP2 are cytosolic RNA-binding proteins that bind RNA stem-loops located in the 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs encoding proteins that are involved in iron homeostasis. In cells exposed to hypoxia, IRP1 RNA binding was decreased approximately 2. 8-fold after a 6-h exposure to 3% O2. Hypoxic inactivation of IRP1 was abolished when cells were pretreated with the iron chelator desferrioxamine, indicating a role for iron in inactivation. IRP1 inactivation was reversible since re-exposure of hypoxically-treated cells to 21% O2 increased RNA binding activity approximately 7-fold after 21 h with an increase in activity seen as early as 1-h post-reoxygenation. IRP1 protein levels were unaffected during hypoxia as well as during reoxygenation. Whereas the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not block IRP1 inactivation during hypoxia, it completely blocked IRP1 reactivation during subsequent reoxygenation. Reactivation of IRP1 during reoxygenation was also partially blocked by the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Finally, reactivated IRP1 was found to be resistant to inactivation by exogenous iron known to down-regulate its activity during normoxia. These data demonstrate that IRP1 RNA binding activity is post-translationally regulated during hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation. Regulation of IRP1 by changing oxygen tension may provide a novel mechanism for post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression under these stresses.",1998,273,13,7588-93,10.1074/jbc.273.13.7588,#3454,Hanson 1998,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of dual combinations of tocolytics in vitro. Human myometrium was obtained during elective cesarean sections (term without labor; n = 40). Myometrial strips were placed in organ baths for the measurement of isometric tension. Contractile activity was induced by oxytocin (10(-)(8) mol/L), then a concentration-response curve to single or dual combinations of tocolytics was started. All studied tocolytics (nifedipine, ritodrine, nitroglycerin, atosiban, and NS-1619), when used alone, significantly inhibited myometrial contractions. When combined, nifedipine plus ritodrine produced a significantly greater inhibition of contractility than each drug alone in the midrange of concentrations. The combination of nifedipine plus nitroglycerin or nifedipine plus atosiban produced a significantly greater inhibition than nitroglycerin or atosiban alone but not greater than nifedipine. The combination of nifedipine plus NS-1619 (Ca(+2)-activated K(+) [BK(Ca)] channel opener) reduced the inhibitory effect of each drug. We concluded that a selected combination of tocolytics (nifedipine plus ritodrine) produced a significantly greater inhibitory effect on contractility than each drug alone at intermediate concentrations. Thus, specific combinations of tocolytics with different intracellular signaling pathways may have a synergic effect constituting a provocative new option for preterm labor treatment.",2017,24,4,635-640,10.1177/1933719116667221,#3455,Carvajal 2017,human myometrium
771,12401983.0,The role of synthetic and biological prostheses in reconstructive pelvic floor surgery.,Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Uterovaginal prolapse and urinary incontinence are common problems whose pathogenesis remains unclear. As life expectancy increases, significantly greater numbers of women will present with pelvic floor prolapse and incontinence requiring surgical intervention. Currently, the lifetime risk of undergoing prolapse or continence surgery in the USA is one in 11, and up to 30% of patients will require repeat prolapse and 10% repeat continence surgery. In an attempt to improve surgical outcomes and to preserve vaginal capacity and coital function, a number of synthetic and biological prostheses have been developed. This review aims to look at the controversies that exist as the 'ideal' prosthetic material is developed. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent literature has reflected the increasing interest in the use of biological prostheses (Allograft/Xenograft) and synthetic absorbable meshes. There has been a focus on the risk factors for erosion seen with the use of synthetic non-absorbable material and a review of techniques for the reduction and management of this complication. The advent of mesh placement in minimally invasive continence surgery (tension-free vaginal tape, intravaginal sling, and Supra Public ARC) is now seeing surgical success to 5 years, but the reporting of complications remains inconsistent. SUMMARY: The use of prosthetics in pelvic floor and continence surgery is an evolving field. Further randomized controlled trials are required to evaluate the role of both biological and synthetic prostheses in reconstructive surgery, to determine which type of prosthesis is most suitable for specific procedures. Prosthetic reinforcement should not be used to replace good surgical techniques.",2002,14,5,527-35,10.1097/00001703-200210000-00015,#3456,Birch 2002,
772,32376753.0,Validation of a clinical examination to differentiate a cervicogenic source of headache: a diagnostic prediction model using controlled diagnostic blocks.,BMJ Open,"OBJECTIVES: Neck pain commonly accompanies recurrent headaches such as migraine, tension-type and cervicogenic headache. Neck pain may be part of the headache symptom complex or a local source. Patients commonly seek neck treatment to alleviate headache, but this is only indicated when cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction is the source of pain. Clinical presentation of reduced cervical extension, painful cervical joint dysfunction and impaired muscle function collectively has been shown to identify cervicogenic headache among patients with recurrent headaches. The pattern's validity has not been tested against the 'gold standard' of controlled diagnostic blocks. This study assessed the validity of this pattern of cervical musculoskeletal signs to identify a cervical source of headache and neck pain, against controlled diagnostic blocks, in patients with headache and neck pain. DESIGN: Prospective concurrent validity study that employed a diagnostic model building approach to analysis. SETTING: Hospital-based multidisciplinary outpatient clinic in Joliet, Illinois. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of participants who presented to a headache clinic with recurrent headaches associated with neck pain. Sixty participants were enrolled and thirty were included in the analysis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants underwent a clinical examination consisting of relevant tests of cervical musculoskeletal dysfunction. Controlled diagnostic blocks of C2/C3-C3/C4 established a cervical source of neck pain. Penalised logistic regression identified clinical signs to be included in a diagnostic model that best predicted participants' responses to diagnostic blocks. RESULTS: Ten of thirty participants responded to diagnostic blocks. The full pattern of cervical musculoskeletal signs best predicted participants' responses (expected prediction error = 0.57) and accounted for 65% of the variance in responses. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the validity of the musculoskeletal pattern to identify a cervical source of headache and neck pain. Adopting this criterion pattern may strengthen cervicogenic headache diagnosis and inform differential diagnosis of neck pain accompanying migraine and tension-type headache.",2020,10,5,e035245,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035245,#3457,Getsoian 2020,migraine
773,8825036.0,Use of thapsigargin to study Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiac cells.,Biosci Rep,"Several reports have documented that thapsigargin is a potent inhibitor of the SR Ca2+ ATPase isolated from cardiac or skeletal muscle. We have characterized the specificity of this agent in intact rat cardiac myocytes using cells maintained in the whole cell voltage clamp configuration. We have shown that thapsigargin decreases the magnitude of the Ca2+ transient and the twitch by about 80% while it slows the decay rate for these responses. These changes were not accompanied by any alterations in sarcolemmal currents or in the trigger Ca2+ generated by the inward calcium current. Taken together these results reveal that the action of thapsigargin is restricted to the SR Ca2+ ATPase in intact cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, it is demonstrated unambiguously that SR intracellular Ca2+ stores are an absolute requirement for the development of contractile tension in rat heart myocytes. It is shown that thapsigargin is a valuable probe to examine the importance of SR pools of Ca2+ and the role of the Ca2+ ATPase in intact myocytes as well as in genetically altered heart cells.",1995,15,5,341-9,10.1007/BF01788366,#3458,Rogers 1995,
774,6375843.0,"Calcium antagonists, cerebral ischemia and vasospasm.",Can J Neurol Sci,The past fifteen years has seen the classification of diverse substances into a group known as calcium antagonists (CAs). They have a common ability to reduce the transmembrane transport of extracellular calcium ions (CAe2+). This flow of calcium into vascular smooth muscle is ultimately associated with the development of tension and vasoconstriction. Some CAs appear to have a predilection for cerebral as opposed to systemic arteries and so may function as specific cerebral arterial vasodilators.

Animal experiments and initial clinical trials give grounds for cautious optimism that CAs may become as useful in neurology as they have recently become in cardiology.,1984,11,2,239-46,10.1017/s0317167100045479,#3459,Weir 1984,
775,9530095.0,Cell-specific promoter in adenovirus vector for transgenic expression of SERCA1 ATPase in cardiac myocytes.,Am J Physiol,"Adenovirus-mediated transfer of cDNA encoding the chicken skeletal muscle sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA1) yielded selective expression in cultured chick embryo cardiac myocytes under control of a segment (-268 base pair) of the cell-specific cardiac troponin T (cTnT) promoter or nonselective expression in myocytes and fibroblasts under control of a constitutive viral [cytomegalovirus (CMV)] promoter. Under optimal conditions nearly all cardiac myocytes in culture were shown to express transgenic SERCA1 ATPase. Expression was targeted to intracellular membranes and was recovered in subcellular fractions with a pattern identical to that of the endogenous SERCA2a ATPase. Relative to control myocytes, transgenic SERCA1 expression increased up to four times the rates of ATP-dependent (and thapsigargin-sensitive) Ca2+ transport activity of cell homogenates. Although the CMV promoter was more active than the cTnT promoter, an upper limit for transgenic expression of functional enzyme was reached under control of either promoter by adjustment of the adenovirus plaque-forming unit titer of infection media. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration transients and tension development of whole myocytes were also influenced to a similar limit by transgenic expression of SERCA1 under control of either promoter. Our experiments demonstrate that a cell-specific protein promoter in recombinant adenovirus vectors yields highly efficient and selective transgene expression of a membrane-bound and functional enzyme in cardiac myocytes.",1998,274,3,C645-53,10.1152/ajpcell.1998.274.3.C645,#3460,Inesi 1998,
776,15518089.0,[Pulmonary function results in healthy subjects breathing through external stenoses compared to patients with airway obstruction].,Wien Klin Wochenschr,"We compared body plethysmographic data, flow-volume curves during spontaneous breathing, P0.1 and PETCO2 in healthy subjects breathing through external stenoses (ES) of varying magnitude to the results in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) remained unchanged by experimental airway stenoses. IVC is mainly determined by the end-expiratory closure of the airways, which only weakly correlates with airway resistance in patients. External stenoses had no effect on the physiological end-expiratory closure of the airways. For the other spirometric parameters the available force of the respiratory muscles and the degree of the experimental stenosis played the major role. The mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1) showed considerably lower variation during ES as well as in COPD patients than total resistance (Rt). There was no increase in intrathoracic gas volume (IGV) causing increased tension of the lungs and the thorax during ES. The well-known correlation between Rt and IGV is attributed to the end-expiratory closure of the airways during increased flow resistance and to ""trapped air"". It remains open, if and how the expiratory muscles act to overcome the increased resistance. With consideration of the underlying factors of the different lung function measures, the combination and the analysis of the correlation between different values may lead to far-reaching results in lung function testing.",2004,116 Suppl 1,,31-7,,#3461,SchÃ¤fer 2004,
777,14749664.0,Effect of an oxytocin receptor antagonist and rho kinase inhibitor on the [Ca++]i sensitivity of human myometrium.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the possible mechanism and effect of oxytocin receptor on the sensitization of the contractile proteins to [Ca(++)](i). STUDY DESIGN: Myometrial strips were prepared from biopsy specimens that had been taken at term (37-40 weeks of gestation) cesarean delivery from 22 women, before the onset of labor. Simultaneous measurements of [Ca(++)](i) and tension were performed on spontaneously contracting strips. The effects of a specific oxytocin receptor antagonist, L371,257, and a rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, on the [Ca(++)](i) and tension transients were determined. RESULTS: Application of L371,257 (90 nmol/L) to spontaneously contracting muscle strips reduced peak tension to 43%+/-12% of its original value without affecting peak [Ca(++)](i) (105%+/-15%). More tension is developed at each [Ca(++)](i) during the falling phase, relative to the rising phase of each spontaneous contraction; this asymmetric [Ca(++)](i)-tension relationship was abolished by L371,257. The subsequent application of oxytocin (3 micromol/L) reversed the effects of the antagonist on tension. An inhibitor of rho kinase (Y-27632) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of spontaneous contractions without affecting the underlying Ca(++) signals. The addition of oxytocin (1 nmol/L) to spontaneously active myometrium increased both the duration of the Ca(++) signal and the sensitivity of the contractile machinery to [Ca(++)](i); only the latter effect was prevented by Y-27632. CONCLUSION: Oxytocin independently regulates the duration of the periodic Ca(++) signals and the sensitivity of the contractile machinery to Ca(++). The latter is likely to be mediated by rho kinase, which is essential for the effective coupling of increases in [Ca(++)](i) to tension.",2004,190,1,222-8,10.1016/s0002-9378(03)00925-6,#3462,Woodcock 2004,
778,12909312.0,beta3-Adrenergic stimulation produces a decrease of cardiac contractility ex vivo in mice overexpressing the human beta3-adrenergic receptor.,Cardiovasc Res,"OBJECTIVES: The regulation of cardiac function by catecholamines involves three populations of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR). beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR stimulations produce an increase in contractility and beta(3)-AR stimulation mediates a negative inotropic effect in human ventricular muscle. Because of the lack of suitable animal models, we have generated transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of the human beta(3)-AR (TG beta(3) mice). METHODS: TG beta(3) mice were produced by microinjection of the human beta(3)-AR under the control of the alpha myosin heavy chain promoter. Phenotypic analyses comprised beta(3)-AR mRNA and protein determinations, histological studies, electrocardiogram, contractility and cyclic nucleotide measurements. RESULTS: TG beta(3) mice presented no histological evidence of myocyte hypertrophy or fibrogenesis. In basal conditions, TG beta(3) mice were characterized by an increase in heart rate and an acceleration of twitch parameters without modification of its amplitude. beta(3)-AR agonists (CL 316243, SR 58611A) decreased contractility at low concentrations (1-100 nM). At high concentrations, the negative inotropic effect was abolished. Pretreatment with nadolol, a beta(1)/beta(2)-AR blocker, blunted the rebound in peak tension elicited by beta(3)-AR agonists suggesting a non-specific action of these compounds on beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR. The involvement of beta(3)-AR in the negative inotropic effect was confirmed by the pretreatment with bupranolol, a non-selective beta-AR antagonist, which fully abolished the effects of SR 58611A. The negative inotropic effect was associated with an increase in intracellular cGMP level. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cardiac overexpression of beta(3)-AR in mice reproduces ex vivo the negative inotropic effects obtained with beta(3)-AR stimulation in human ventricular tissues.",2003,59,2,288-96,10.1016/s0008-6363(03)00359-6,#3463,Tavernier 2003,
779,22507883.0,Allergen and ozone exacerbate serotonin-induced increases in airway smooth muscle contraction in a model of childhood asthma.,Respiration,"BACKGROUND: Serotonin (5-HT) modulates cholinergic neurotransmission and exacerbates airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction in normal animal and nonasthmatic human tissue. Exposure to house dust mite allergen (HDMA) and ozone (O(3)) leads to airway hyperreactivity and 5-HT-positive cells in the airway epithelium of infant rhesus monkeys. Research shows that concomitant exposure in allergic animals has an additive effect on airway hyperreactivity. OBJECTIVES: In this study, the hypothesis is that the exposure of allergic infant rhesus monkeys to HDMA, O(3) and in combination, acting through 5-HT receptors, enhances 5-HT modulation of postganglionic cholinergic ASM contraction. METHODS: Twenty-four HDMA-sensitized infant monkeys were split into 4 groups at the age of 1 month, and were exposed to filtered air (FA), HDMA, O(3) or in combination (HDMA+O(3)). At the age of 6 months, airway rings were harvested and postganglionic, and parasympathetic-mediated ASM contraction was evaluated using electrical-field stimulation (EFS). RESULTS: 5-HT exacerbated the EFS response within all exposure groups, but had no effect in the FA group. 5-HT(2), 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(4) receptor agonists exacerbated the response. 5-HT concentration-response curves performed after incubation with specific receptor antagonists confirmed the involvement of 5-HT(2), 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(4) receptors. Conversely, a 5-HT(1) receptor agonist attenuated the tension across all groups during EFS, and in ASM contracted via exogenous acetylcholine. CONCLUSIONS: HDMA, O(3) and HDMA+O(3) exposure in a model of childhood allergic asthma enhances 5-HT exacerbation of EFS-induced ASM contraction through 5-HT(2), 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(4) receptors. A nonneurogenic inhibitory pathway exists, unaffected by exposure, mediated by 5-HT(1) receptors located on ASM.",2012,83,6,529-42,10.1159/000336835,#3464,Moore 2012,
780,25052823.0,Is it possible to assess the best mitral valve repair in the individual patient? Preliminary results of a finite element study from magnetic resonance imaging data.,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,"OBJECTIVES: Finite element modeling was adopted to quantitatively compare, for the first time and on a patient-specific basis, the biomechanical effects of a broad spectrum of different neochordal implantation techniques for the repair of isolated posterior mitral leaflet prolapse. METHODS: Cardiac magnetic resonance images were acquired from 4 patients undergoing surgery. A patient-specific 3-dimensional model of the mitral apparatus and the motion of the annulus and papillary muscles were reconstructed. The location and extent of the prolapsing region were confirmed by intraoperative findings, and the mechanical properties of the mitral leaflets, chordae tendineae and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene neochordae were included. Mitral systolic biomechanics was simulated under preoperative conditions and after 5 different neochordal procedures: single neochorda, double neochorda, standard neochordal loop with 3 neochordae of the same length and 2 premeasured loops with 1 common neochordal loop and 3 different branched neochordae arising from it, alternatively one third and two thirds of the entire length. RESULTS: The best repair in terms of biomechanics was achieved with a specific neochordal technique in the single patient, according to the location of the prolapsing region. However, all techniques achieved a slight reduction in papillary muscle forces and tension relief in intact native chordae proximal to the prolapsing region. Multiple neochordae implantation improved the repositioning of the prolapsing region below the annular plane and better redistributed mechanical stresses on the leaflet. CONCLUSIONS: Although applied on a small cohort of patients, systematic biomechanical differences were noticed between neochordal techniques, potentially affecting their short- to long-term clinical outcomes. This study opens the way to patient-specific optimization of neochordal techniques.",2014,148,3,1025-34; discussion 1034,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.05.071,#3465,Sturla 2014,
781,14962477.0,New concepts in reactive oxygen species and cardiovascular reperfusion physiology.,Cardiovasc Res,"Increasingly complex behavior of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are noted within biological systems. Classically free radicals and ROS were considered injurious, however current mechanisms describe both protective and deleterious effects. A burst of ROS has been well described with the first moments of reperfusion and is associated with injury. However ROS can also be protective as signal preconditioning protection and induce stress responses that lead to survival. ROS generation is appreciated to occur during ischemia despite the low oxygen tension, from a likely mitochondria source, and ROS-induced ROS release may amplify its signal. The burst of ROS seen during reperfusion may originate from a different cellular source than during ischemia and is not yet fully identified. ROS and cellular redox conditions regulate a large number of vital pathways (energy metabolism, survival/stress responses, apoptosis, inflammatory response, oxygen sensing, etc). While cellular systems may demonstrate reperfusion injury, whole organ and animal models continue to report contradictory results on reperfusion injury and the role of antioxidants as a therapy. Collectively, these data may offer insight into why clinical trials of antioxidants have had such mixed and mostly negative results. Future antioxidant therapies are likely to be effective but they must become: more specific for site of action, not have deleterious effects on other signaling pathways, be targeted to a specific reactive oxygen species or cellular compartment, and be ""time sensitive"" so they deliver the correct therapy at precisely the correct time in ischemia and reperfusion.",2004,61,3,461-70,10.1016/j.cardiores.2003.10.025,#3466,Becker 2004,
782,29343782.0,Protein phosphatase 5 regulates titin phosphorylation and function at a sarcomere-associated mechanosensor complex in cardiomyocytes.,Nat Commun,"Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells; however, its function in cardiomyocytes is unknown. Under basal conditions, PP5 is autoinhibited, but enzymatic activity rises upon binding of specific factors, such as the chaperone Hsp90. Here we show that PP5 binds and dephosphorylates the elastic N2B-unique sequence (N2Bus) of titin in cardiomyocytes. Using various binding and phosphorylation tests, cell-culture manipulation, and transgenic mouse hearts, we demonstrate that PP5 associates with N2Bus in vitro and in sarcomeres and is antagonistic to several protein kinases, which phosphorylate N2Bus and lower titin-based passive tension. PP5 is pathologically elevated and likely contributes to hypo-phosphorylation of N2Bus in failing human hearts. Furthermore, Hsp90-activated PP5 interacts with components of a sarcomeric, N2Bus-associated, mechanosensor complex, and blocks mitogen-activated protein-kinase signaling in this complex. Our work establishes PP5 as a compartmentalized, well-controlled phosphatase in cardiomyocytes, which regulates titin properties and kinase signaling at the myofilaments.",2018,9,1,262,10.1038/s41467-017-02483-3,#3467,Krysiak 2018,
783,34781843.0,Neurodynamics: is tension contentious?,J Man Manip Ther,"Tensioning techniqueswere the first neurodynamic techniques used therapeutically in the management of people with neuropathies. This article aims to provide a balanced evidence-informed view on the effects of optimal tensile loading on peripheral nerves and the use of tensioning techniques. Whilst the early use of neurodynamics was centered within a mechanical paradigm, research into the working mechanisms of tensioning techniques revealed neuroimmune, neurophysiological, and neurochemical effects. In-vitro and ex-vivo research confirms that tensile loading is required for mechanical adaptation of healthy and healing neurons and nerves. Moreover, elimination of tensile load can have detrimental effects on the nervous system. Beneficial effects of tensile loading and tensioning techniques, contributing to restored homeostasis at the entrapment site, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord, include neuronal cell differentiation, neurite outgrowth and orientation, increased endogenous opioid receptors, reduced fibrosis and intraneural scar formation, improved nerve regeneration and remyelination, increased muscle power and locomotion, less mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia, and improved conditioned pain modulation. However, animal and cellular models also show that 'excessive' tensile forces have negative effects on the nervous system. Although robust and designed to withstand mechanical load, the nervous system is equally a delicate system. Mechanical loads that can be easily handled by a healthy nervous system, may be sufficient to aggravate clinical symptoms in patients. This paper aims to contribute to a more balanced view regarding the use of neurodynamics and more specifically tensioning techniques.",2022,30,1,12-Mar,10.1080/10669817.2021.2001736,#3468,Ellis 2022,Neurodynamics
784,9644227.0,Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ loading in rabbits 8 and 15 weeks after coronary artery ligation.,Pflugers Arch,"Calcium uptake by cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is reported to be reduced in heart failure in the human and in a number of animal models. However, the majority of studies have examined end-stage heart failure in the human and few animal studies have taken account of the duration and severity of left ventricular dysfunction. In this study we have compared SR Ca2+ loading in a haemodynamically assessed, coronary artery ligation model of heart failure at 8 and 15 weeks after ligation. Trabeculae were isolated from the right ventricle and mounted for isometric tension measurement. They were treated with saponin to permeabilize the sarcolemma but retain SR function and bathed in a mock intracellular solution including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and buffered Ca2+. Caffeine was used to release Ca2+ from the SR. The amplitude of the caffeine-induced contracture was used as a quantitative gauge of the Ca2+ content of the SR. Eight weeks after ligation, trabeculae demonstrated enhanced SR Ca2+ uptake as manifest by larger caffeine-induced contractures (e.g. 200 nM [Ca2+], 120 s loading - 38.2+/-9.2 versus 67.3+/-10.1% of maximum Ca2+-activated force, FCa, max, P=0.03). At 15 weeks, trabeculae from ligated hearts were not significantly different from controls with SR Ca2+ loading returning to control levels (e.g. 200 nM [Ca2+], 120 s loading - 47.3+/-9.6 versus 30.2+/-12.8% FCa, max, P=0.12). These data suggest that SR Ca2+ loading may increase in the early stages of heart failure and fall back to normal with an increasing duration of left ventricular dysfunction. Increased incidence of spontaneous Ca2+ release observed from the SR at 8 weeks and not at 15 weeks may represent an arrhythmogenic mechanism specific to the early phase of heart failure.",1998,436,3,436-42,10.1007/s004240050654,#3469,Denvir 1998,
785,29914939.0,"Transcriptional upregulation of Bag3, a chaperone-assisted selective autophagy factor, in animal models of KY-deficient hereditary myopathy.",Dis Model Mech,"The importance of kyphoscoliosis peptidase (KY) in skeletal muscle physiology has recently been emphasised by the identification of novel human myopathies associated with KY deficiency. Neither the pathogenic mechanism of KY deficiency nor a specific role for KY in muscle function have been established. However, aberrant localisation of filamin C (FLNC) in muscle fibres has been shown in humans and mice with loss-of-function mutations in the KY gene. FLNC turnover has been proposed to be controlled by chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), a client-specific and tension-induced pathway that is required for muscle maintenance. Here, we have generated new C2C12 myoblast and zebrafish models of KY deficiency by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis. To obtain insights into the pathogenic mechanism caused by KY deficiency, expression of the co-chaperone BAG3 and other CASA factors was analyzed in the cellular, zebrafish and ky/ky mouse models. Ky-deficient C2C12-derived clones show trends of higher transcription of CASA factors in differentiated myotubes. The ky-deficient zebrafish model (ky(yo1)/ky(yo1) ) lacks overt signs of pathology, but shows significantly increased bag3 and flnca/b expression in embryos and adult muscle. Additionally, ky(yo1)/ky(yo1) embryos challenged by swimming in viscous media show an inability to further increase expression of these factors in contrast with wild-type controls. The ky/ky mouse shows elevated expression of Bag3 in the non-pathological exterior digitorum longus (EDL) and evidence of impaired BAG3 turnover in the pathological soleus. Thus, upregulation of CASA factors appears to be an early and primary molecular hallmark of KY deficiency.",2018,11,7,,10.1242/dmm.033225,#3470,Jokl 2018,BAG3

Specific diaphragm involvement has been suggested by a drop in supine volumes. This pilot study aimed at characterizing the respiratory muscle phenotype in patients with COL6A1-3 genes mutations. Lung function, blood gases, muscle strength and respiratory mechanics were measured in 7 patients between 2002 and 2012. Patients were classified as Early-Severe (n = 3), Moderate-Progressive (n = 2) and Mild (n = 2) according to clinical disease presentation. Seven patients (aged 6-28) were evaluated. Forced vital capacity distinguished the Mild group (>60% predicted) from the two other groups (<50% predicted). This distinction was also possible using the motor function measure scale. Diaphragmatic dysfunction at rest was observed in all the Early-Severe and Moderate-Progressive patients. During a voluntary sniff maneuver diaphragmatic dysfunction was observed in all patients, as assessed by a negative gastric pressure. All patients had diaphragmatic fatigue assessed by a tension-time index over the threshold of 0.15. Diaphragmatic dysfunction during a maximal voluntary maneuver and diaphragmatic fatigue are constant features in Collagen VI myopathies.

Elocalcitol is a vitamin D receptor agonist inhibiting RhoA/Rho kinase signaling in rat and human bladder. Since in the normal bladder from Sprague-Dawley rats elocalcitol treatment delayed the carbachol-induced contraction without changing maximal responsiveness and increased sensitivity to the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist isradipine, we investigated whether elocalcitol upregulated L-type Ca2+ channels in human bladder smooth muscle cells (hBCs). In hBCs, elocalcitol induced a rapid increase in intracellular [Ca2+], which was abrogated by the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist verapamil. Moreover, hBCs exhibited L-type voltage-activated Ca2+ currents (I Ca), which were selectively blocked by isradipine and verapamil and enhanced by the selective L-type agonist BAY K 8644. Addition of elocalcitol (10(-7) M) increased L-type I Ca size and specific conductance by inducing faster activation and inactivation kinetics than control and BAY K 8644, while determining a significant negative shift of the activation and inactivation curves, comparable to BAY K 8644. These effects were strengthened in long-term treated hBCs with elocalcitol (10(-8) M, 48 h), which also showed increased mRNA and protein expression of pore-forming L-type alpha(1C)-subunit. In the bladder from Sprague-Dawley rats, BAY K 8644 induced a dose-dependent increase in tension, which was significantly enhanced by elocalcitol treatment (30 microg.kg(-1).day(-1), 2 wk). In conclusion, elocalcitol upregulated Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels in hBCs, thus balancing its inhibitory effect on RhoA/Rho kinase signaling and suggesting its possible efficacy for the modulation of bladder contractile mechanisms.",2008,294,5,C1206-14,10.1152/ajpcell.90634.2007,#3473,Morelli 2008,

In this paper, we have functionally characterized mouse and zebrafish models of caveolae-associated muscle disease. Using electron tomography, we quantitatively defined the unique three-dimensional membrane architecture of the mature muscle surface. Caveolae occupied around 50% of the sarcolemmal area predominantly assembled into multilobed rosettes. These rosettes were preferentially disassembled in response to increased membrane tension. Caveola-deficient cavin-1(-/-) muscle fibers showed a striking loss of sarcolemmal organization, aberrant T-tubule structures, and increased sensitivity to membrane tension, which was rescued by muscle-specific Cavin-1 reexpression. In vivo imaging of live zebrafish embryos revealed that loss of muscle-specific Cavin-1 or expression of a dystrophy-associated Caveolin-3 mutant both led to sarcolemmal damage but only in response to vigorous muscle activity. Our findings define a conserved and critical role in mechanoprotection for the unique membrane architecture generated by the caveolin-cavin system.",2015,210,5,833-49,10.1083/jcb.201501046,#3474,Lo 2015,

We have compared the motif sequences of titin elastic elements from different vertebrate species and from different regions of the molecule. The I-band titin Ig repeats that are expressed in the stiff cardiac muscle and those that are tissue-specifically expressed in more elastic skeletal muscles represent distinct subgroups. Within the tissue-specifically expressed Ig repeats, a super-repeat structure is found. For the PEVK titin sequences, we surveyed interspecies conservation by hybridization experiments. The sequences of the titin gene which code for the C-terminal region of the PEVK domain are conserved in the genomes of a larger variety of vertebrates, whereas the N-terminal PEVK sequences are more divergent. Future comparisons of titin gene sequences from different vertebrates may improve our understanding of how titin contributes to species diversity of myofibrillar elasticity. Within one species, different classes of Ig repeat families may contribute to elastic diversity of the titin spring in different segments.",1998,122,2-Jan,206-15,10.1006/jsbi.1998.3993,#3475,Witt 1998,

This paper develops a porcine (sus scrofa domestica) model of the 6-year-old human's abdomen, and then defines the biomechanical response of this abdominal model. First, a detailed abdominal necropsy study was undertaken, which involved collecting a series of anthropometric measurements and organ masses on 25 swine, ranging in age from 14 to 429 days (4-101 kg mass). These were then compared to the corresponding human quantities to identify the best porcine representation of a 6-year-old human's abdomen. This was determined to be a pig of age 77 days, and whole-body mass of 21.4 kg. The sub-injury, quasistatic response to belt loading of this porcine model compared well with pediatric human volunteer tests performed with a lap belt on the lower abdomen. A test fixture was designed to produce transverse, dynamic belt loading on the porcine abdomen. A detailed review of field cases identified the following test variables: loading location (upper/lower), penetration magnitude (23%-68% of initial abdominal depth), muscle tensing (yes/no), and belt penetration rate (quasistatic, dynamic 2.9 m/s - 7.8 m/s). Dynamic tests were performed on 47 post-mortem subjects. Belt tension and dorsal reaction force were cross-plotted with abdominal penetration to generate structural response corridors. Subcutaneous stimulation of the anterior abdominal muscle wall stiffened the quasistatic response significantly, but was of negligible importance in the dynamic tests. The upper abdomen exhibited stiffer response quasistatically, and also was more sensitive to penetration rate, with stiffness increasing significantly over the range of dynamic rates tested here. In contrast, the lower abdomen was relatively rate insensitive. To our knowledge, this is the only dynamic structural characterization study on a comprehensively developed experimental model of the 6-year-old human abdomen. The structural corridors developed here should lead to the development of both mechanical (i.e., crash dummies) and computational pediatric models that are more useful for assessing injurious levels of belt penetration into the abdomen.",2006,50,,26-Jan,10.4271/2006-22-0001,#3476,Kent 2006,

Unfortunately, lack of selectivity, specificity, and bioavailability have slowed down development of inhibitors for clinical use. We investigated a novel CaMKIIδ/CaMKIIɣ-selective, ATP-competitive, orally available CaMKII inhibitor (RA608) on right atrial biopsies of 119 patients undergoing heart surgery. Furthermore, we evaluated its oral efficacy to prevent deterioration of HF in mice after transverse aortic constriction (TAC). METHODS AND RESULTS: In human atrial cardiomyocytes and trabeculae, respectively, RA608 significantly reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca leak, reduced diastolic tension, and increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca content. Patch-clamp recordings confirmed the safety of RA608 in human cardiomyocytes. C57BL6/J mice were subjected to TAC, and left ventricular function was monitored by echocardiography. Two weeks after TAC, RA608 was administered by oral gavage for 7 days. Oral RA608 treatment prevented deterioration of ejection fraction. At 3 weeks after TAC, ejection fraction was 46.1 ± 3.7% (RA608) vs. 34.9 ± 2.6% (vehicle), n = 9 vs. n = 12, P < 0.05, ANOVA, which correlated with significantly less CaMKII autophosphorylation at threonine 287. Moreover, a single oral dose significantly reduced inducibility of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in CaMKIIδ transgenic mice 4 h after administration. Atrial fibrillation was induced in 6/6 mice for vehicle vs. 1/7 for RA608, P < 0.05, 'n - 1' χ(2) test. Ventricular tachycardia was induced in 6/7 for vehicle vs. 2/7 for RA608, P < 0.05, 'n - 1' χ(2) test. CONCLUSIONS: RA608 is the first orally administrable CaMKII inhibitor with potent efficacy in human myocytes. Moreover, oral administration potently inhibits arrhythmogenesis and attenuates HF development in mice in vivo.",2020,7,5,2871-2883,10.1002/ehf2.12895,#3478,Mustroph 2020,Arrhythmias

METHOD: Fifty patients between 4 and 18 years of age were examined: 31 had headaches (24 migraine, 4 tension type and 3 unspecific headache) and 19 formed the control group. The data collection was comprised of a structured questionnaire answered by the children's parents, and a subjective evaluation about the childrens emotional state. A specific questionnaire for TMD was applied, followed by a clinical dental examination of the children. As signs of TMD, mouth opening limitation, mandibular trajectory deviation in opening mouth, and joint noise were considered. As symptoms, pain on palpation of masseter and temporal muscles and on the poromandibular joint. RESULTS: A significant increase in signs and symptoms of TMD was found in patients with headaches when compared to the control group. There was also a significant difference in signs and symptoms of TMD according to age (increased with age) and emotional state (tense>calm). CONCLUSION: There is a higher frequency of TMD in pediatric patients with headaches; thus, it is important to look for TMD signs and symptoms in this population.",2007,65,2A,251-5,10.1590/s0004-282x2007000200012,#3479,Bertoli 2007,
795,27150586.0,Effects of Cardiac Troponin I Mutation P83S on Contractile Properties and the Modulation by PKA-Mediated Phosphorylation.,J Phys Chem B,"cTnI(P82S) (cTnI(P83S) in rodents) resides at the I-T arm of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and was initially identified as a disease-causing mutation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, later studies suggested this may not be true. We recently reported that introduction of an HCM-associated mutation in either inhibitory-peptide (cTnI(R146G)) or cardiac-specific N-terminus (cTnI(R21C)) of cTnI blunts the PKA-mediated modulation on myofibril activation/relaxation kinetics by prohibiting formation of intrasubunit contacts between these regions. Here, we tested whether this also occurs for cTnI(P83S). cTnI(P83S) increased both Ca(2+) binding affinity to cTn (KCa) and affinity of cTnC for cTnI (KC-I), and eliminated the reduction of KCa and KC-I observed for phosphorylated-cTnI(WT). In isolated myofibrils, cTnI(P83S) maintained maximal tension (TMAX) and Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension (pCa50). For cTnI(WT) myofibrils, PKA-mediated phosphorylation decreased pCa50 and sped up the slow-phase relaxation (especially for those Ca(2+) conditions that heart performs in vivo). Those effects were blunted for cTnI(P83S) myofibrils. Molecular-dynamics simulations suggested cTnI(P83S) moderately inhibited an intrasubunit interaction formation between inhibitory-peptide and N-terminus, but this ""blunting"" effect was weaker than that with cTnI(R146G) or cTnI(R21C). In summary, cTnI(P83S) has similar effects as other HCM-associated cTnI mutations on troponin and myofibril function even though it is in the I-T arm of cTnI.",2016,120,33,8238-53,10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b01859,#3480,Cheng 2016,
796,24835277.0,Gene-specific increase in the energetic cost of contraction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by thick filament mutations.,Cardiovasc Res,"AIMS: Disease mechanisms regarding hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are largely unknown and disease onset varies. Sarcomere mutations might induce energy depletion for which until now there is no direct evidence at sarcomere level in human HCM. This study investigated if mutations in genes encoding myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) and myosin heavy chain (MYH7) underlie changes in the energetic cost of contraction in the development of human HCM disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Energetic cost of contraction was studied in vitro by measurements of force development and ATPase activity in cardiac muscle strips from 26 manifest HCM patients (11 MYBPC3mut, 9 MYH7mut, and 6 sarcomere mutation-negative, HCMsmn). In addition, in vivo, the ratio between external work (EW) and myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) to obtain myocardial external efficiency (MEE) was determined in 28 pre-hypertrophic mutation carriers (14 MYBPC3mut and 14 MYH7mut) and 14 healthy controls using [(11)C]-acetate positron emission tomography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Tension cost (TC), i.e. ATPase activity during force development, was higher in MYBPC3mut and MYH7mut compared with HCMsmn at saturating [Ca(2+)]. TC was also significantly higher in MYH7mut at submaximal, more physiological [Ca(2+)]. EW was significantly lower in both mutation carrier groups, while MVO2 did not differ. MEE was significantly lower in both mutation carrier groups compared with controls, showing the lowest efficiency in MYH7 mutation carriers. CONCLUSION: We provide direct evidence that sarcomere mutations perturb the energetic cost of cardiac contraction. Gene-specific severity of cardiac abnormalities may underlie differences in disease onset and suggests that early initiation of metabolic treatment may be beneficial, in particular, in MYH7 mutation carriers.",2014,103,2,248-57,10.1093/cvr/cvu127,#3481,Witjas-Paalberends 2014,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
797,7512043.0,"Effects of dicentrine, a novel alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, on human hyperplastic prostates.",Eur J Pharmacol,"The effects of dicentrine, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, on human hyperplastic prostates were investigated by radioligand binding and in vitro isometric tension experiments. In human hyperplastic prostates, alpha 1-adrenoceptors were characterized by a binding assay using [3H]prazosin as a radioligand. Specific [3H]prazosin binding was saturable and of high affinity (Kd = 0.2 +/- 0.02 nM) with a maximal number of binding sites (Bmax = 55.2 +/- 3.2 fmol/mg protein). alpha-Adrenoceptor antagonists competed with [3H]prazosin for binding in the order: dicentrine > phentolamine > rauwolscine. Norepinephrine (0.3-100 microM) or phenylephrine (1-300 microM) produced gradual contractions of human hyperplastic prostates. The concentration-response curve of norepinephrine or phenylephrine was shifted in parallel to the right by dicentrine, consistent with a competitive blockade. The pA2 values of dicentrine against norepinephrine and phenylephrine were 8.04 +/- 0.09 and 8.33 +/- 0.11, respectively. These experiments were conducted to confirm that there was no interaction between alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the tissue. Rauwolscine (1 microM) caused 1.7-fold, while dicentrine (0.1 microM) caused 15.8-fold shift of norepinephrine-induced contraction of human hyperplastic prostates. Combination of rauwolscine with dicentrine caused 17.8-fold shift of norepinephrine-induced prostatic tissue contraction. The contractile response to transmural field stimulation was abolished by pretreatment with tetrodotoxin, and suppressed concentration dependently by dicentrine or prazosin, whereas rauwolscine had little effect. It is concluded that dicentrine inhibits human hyperplastic prostate contractions in response to exogenous and endogenous adrenergic stimulation. Dicentrine may thus hold potential to relieve bladder outlet obstruction caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia via alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade.",1994,252,1,29-34,10.1016/0014-2999(94)90571-1,#3482,Yu 1994,
798,23809565.0,Toward validation of the cepstral spectral index of dysphonia (CSID) as an objective treatment outcomes measure.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the validity of the Cepstral Spectral Index of Dysphonia (CSID) as an objective treatment outcomes measure of dysphonia severity. METHOD: Pre- and posttreatment samples of sustained vowel and connected speech productions were elicited from 112 patients across six diagnostic categories: unilateral vocal fold paralysis, adductor spasmodic dysphonia, primary muscle tension dysphonia, benign vocal fold lesions, presbylaryngis, and mutational falsetto. Listener ratings of severity in connected speech were compared with a three-factor CSID model consisting of the cepstral peak prominence (CPP), the low-to-high spectral energy ratio, and its standard deviation. Two additional variables, the CPP standard deviation and gender, were included in the five-factor CSID model to estimate severity of vowels. RESULTS: CSID-estimated severity for sustained vowels and connected speech was strongly associated with listener ratings pretreatment, posttreatment, and change observed pre- to posttreatment. Spectrum effects were examined, and severity of dysphonia did not influence the relationship between listener perceived severity and CSID-estimated severity. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm a robust relationship between listener perceived and CSID-derived dysphonia severity estimates in sustained vowels and connected speech across diverse diagnoses and severity levels and support the clinical utility of the CSID as an objective treatment outcomes measure.",2013,27,4,401-10,10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.04.002,#3483,Peterson 2013,
799,19723313.0,Protocol for Physiotherapy Or TVT Randomised Efficacy Trial (PORTRET): a multicentre randomised controlled trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tension free vaginal tape versus pelvic floor muscle training in women with symptomatic moderate to se,BMC Womens Health,"BACKGROUND: Stress urinary incontinence is a common condition affecting approximately 20% of adult women causing substantial individual (quality of life) and economic (119 million Euro/year spent on incontinence pads in the Netherlands) burden. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is regarded as first line treatment, but only 15-25% of women will be completely cured. Approximately 65% will report that their condition improved, but long term adherence to treatment is problematic. In addition, at longer term (2-15 years) follow-up 30-50% of patients will end up having surgery. From 1996 a minimal invasive surgical procedure, the Tension-free Vaginal Tape (TVT) has rapidly become the gold standard in surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence. With TVT 65-95% of women are cured. However, approximately 3-6% of women will develop symptoms of an overactive bladder, resulting in reduced quality of life. Because of its efficacy the TVT appears to be preferable over PFMT but both treatments and their costs have not been compared head-to-head in a randomised clinical trial. METHODS/DESIGN: A multi-centre randomised controlled trial will be performed for women between 35-80 years old with moderate to severe, predominantly stress, urinary incontinence, who have not received specialised PFMT or previous anti-incontinence surgery. Women will be assigned to either PFMT by a specialised physiotherapist for a standard of 9-18 session in a period of 6 months, or TVT(O) surgery. The main endpoint of the study is the subjective improvement of urinary incontinence. As secondary outcome the objective cure will be assessed from history and clinical parameters. Subjective improvement in quality of life will be measured by generic (EQ-5D) and disease-specific (Urinary Distress Inventory and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire) quality of life instruments. The economical endpoint is short term (1 year) incremental cost-effectiveness in terms of costs per additional year free of urinary incontinence and costs per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) gained. Finally, treatment strategy and patient characteristics will be combined in a prediction model, to allow for individual treatment decisions in future patients. Four hundred female patients will be recruited from over 30 hospitals in the Netherlands.

800,23355533.0,Gene expression analysis reveals an angiogenic profile in uterine leiomyoma pseudocapsule.,Mol Hum Reprod,"The pseudocapsule (PC) of the uterine leiomyoma (UL) is an anatomic entity that surrounds the myoma separating it from the myometrium (UM). Although a number of microarray experiments have identified differences in gene expression profile in the UL when compared with the UM, there is a lack of systematic studies on the PC. In this study, quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed on 18 matched PC, UL and UM specimens and results showed that the PC displays a specific gene expression profile. The low expression level of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-2), a fibroid specific marker, that we found in the PC and the UM when compared with the UL, clearly indicates that the PC is in structural continuity with the UM. However, the significant increase in endoglin expression level in PC with respect to the UL and UM indicates that an active neoangiogenesis is present in PC. Conversely, other angiogenic factors such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) seem to have little influence on the PC angiogenesis. Because the endoglin is preferentially expressed in proliferating endothelial cells, whereas the vWF and VEGF-A are preferentially expressed in preexisting endothelial cells, our idea is that the angiogenic activity in the PC is linked to wound healing. The angiogenic activity is also sustained by intermediate expression level of cystein-rich angiogenesis inducer 61, connective tissue growth factor and collagen 4α2 genes all involved in the neoangiogenesis, that we detected in the PC. Taken together our data demonstrate that the specific expression pattern observed in the PC could be the response of the uterine wall's smooth cells to the tension imposed by the tumor. As a consequence, a neovascular structure is generated involving regenerative processes. For these reasons, we suggest that the laparoscopic intracapsular myomectomy (LIM), a new surgical technique that preserves the PC during the UL removal, should always be preferred, to favor a faster and proper uterine healing.",2013,19,6,380-7,10.1093/molehr/gat007,#3485,DiTommaso 2013,angiogenesis
801,25178538.0,Effect of glenohumeral forward flexion on upper limb myoelectric activity during simulated mills manipulation; relations to peripheral nerve biomechanics.,BMC Musculoskelet Disord,"BACKGROUND: It is generally accepted that muscles may activate via the common nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) in response to painful stimuli associated with tensile or compressive forces on peripheral nerves. Following the basic assumption that the radial nerve may be stressed around the elbow during the execution of the Mills manipulation, two positions considered to have different mechanical effects on the radial nerve and the brachial plexus were tested in order to i) explore whether muscles are activated in certain patterns with concomitant changes in nerve tension, ii) establish whether muscle responses can be modified with mechanical unloading of the brachial plexus. METHODS: Muscle responses were quantified bilaterally in eight subjects (N = 16) during Mills Manipulation (MM) pre-manipulative positioning and a Varied position that putatively produces less mechanical tension in the brachial plexus. End range pre-manipulative stretch was used in order to simulate the effects of Mills manipulation. Electromyographic signals were recorded with a 16 channel portable EMG unit and correlated with kinematic data from three charge-coupled device adjustable cameras which allowed for precise movement tracking. RESULTS: Compared with the Standard Mills manipulation position, the Varied position produced significantly reduced myoelectric activity (P ≤ .001) in all test muscles. Additional subjective data support the notion that certain muscle activity patterns were protective. CONCLUSION: It seems that protective muscles are selectively activated in a specific pattern in order to protect the radial nerve from mechanical tension by shortening its pathway, suggesting integration of muscle and neural mechanisms. Furthermore, the significantly decreased myoelectric activity with reduced mechanical tension in the brachial plexus may help controlling collateral effects of the Mills manipulation itself, making it potentially safer and more specific.",2014,15,,288,10.1186/1471-2474-15-288,#3486,Rade 2014,
802,24841669.0,Perceptions of voice therapy from patients diagnosed with primary muscle tension dysphonia and benign mid-membranous vocal fold lesions.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: Studies have established the role of behavioral therapy in treating voice problems. However, studies have also identified patient adherence as a limitation in voice therapy effectiveness. Accordingly, an understanding of patient preferences may help to improve adherence and increase voice therapy success. The primary aim of this study was to understand patient-perceived facilitators and barriers influencing voice therapy effectiveness in a group of treatment-seeking individuals with voice disorders. A secondary aim was to examine the relationship between self-reported improvement from voice therapy and the Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study design. METHODS: One hundred ten patients enrolled in voice therapy at the University of Pittsburgh Voice Center completed a self-administered Patient Perception of Voice Therapy questionnaire on discharge. Data from 45 individuals who met study criteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Patient-reported improvement from voice therapy was correlated with changes in VHI-10 scores. A majority of patients identified specific voice therapy exercises and transfer of techniques to conversation as the most useful aspects of treatment. Few patients rated vocal hygiene education as most useful. Generalizing new vocal behaviors was also identified as a barrier to voice therapy success for many patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, patients valued direct voice therapy in which they worked on altering vocal behaviors more than indirect voice therapy that aimed to educate patients about their voice. Study findings suggest the importance of direct voice therapy and the need to incorporate carryover activities early on in the therapy process for greater treatment satisfaction and success.",2014,28,6,742-52,10.1016/j.jvoice.2014.02.007,#3487,Ziegler 2014,Patient preferences

METHODS: A 5 cm quadriceps tendon graft is harvested with an adjacent 2 cm bone block. The femoral tunnel is created through a low anteromedial portal in its anatomical position. The tibial tunnel is created with a hollow burr, thus acquiring a free cylindrical bone block. The graft is then passed through the tibial tunnel and the bone block, customized at its tip, is tapped into the femoral tunnel through the anteromedial portal to provide press-fit fixation. The graft is tensioned distally and sutures are tied over a bone bridge at the distal end of the tibial tunnel. From the cylindrical bone block harvested from the tibia the proximal end is customized and gently tapped next to the graft tissue into the tibial tunnel to assure press fitting of the graft in the tibial tunnel. The distal part of the tibial tunnel is filled up with the remaining bone.All patients were observed in a prospective fashion with subjective and objective evaluation after 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Thirty patients have been evaluated at a 12 months follow-up. The technique achieved in 96.7% normal or nearly normal results for the objective IKDC. The mean subjective IKDC score was 86.1 ± 15.8. In 96.7% the Tegner score was the same as before injury or decreased one category. A negative or 1+ Lachman test was achieved in all cases. Pivot-shift test was negative or (+) glide in 86.7%. The mean side-to-side difference elevated by instrumental laxity measurement was 1.6 ± 1.1 mm. Full ROM has been achieved in 92.3%.

We have inferred the primary defect in susceptible muscles by observing their responses to certain drugs. Furthermore, we compared the responses of cut muscle cell preparations, such as those used in the diagnostic caffeine test, with those of intact muscle cells. Specifically, we investigated the effects of halothane, caffeine, succinylcholine and catecholamines on the mechanical properties of intact muscle cells from normal pigs, mice and frogs and susceptible pigs. The results from intact and paired cut cell preparations were qualitatively similar. Halothane (2%) caused a 30% decrease in peak tetanic tension in susceptible porcine muscle but less than a 10% change in other muscles. Halothane potentiated twitch tension in frog and susceptible pig muscle. The latter was 4 times more sensitive to caffeine twitch potentiation than normal muscle. Porcine intercostal muscles were more sensitive to caffeine than limb extensor muscles and the difference between normal and susceptible muscle was less with intercostal muscles. Succinylcholine and catecholamines had small and opposite effects on porcine muscles; when used together in combination with halothane there was little effect on normal muscle but a dramatic decrease in tetanic tension and rapid onset of contracture in susceptible muscle.",1980,213,1,91-6,,#3489,Gallant 1980,

Jaw function was assessed by evaluating answers to the mandibular function impairment questionnaire (MFIQ). Tension-type headache was diagnosed according to the International Headache Society (IHS) classification. Psychological status was assessed using the depression score and the non-specific physical symptom score with subscales of the Revised Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90-R). The prevalence of reported pain in the face, jaws and/or TMJs was 14 and 9 per cent for the CLP and non-cleft group, respectively, and did not differ significantly between the groups. The CLP group exhibited a significantly reduced jaw-opening pattern (P < 0.001) and a higher frequency of crossbites (P < 0.05) compared with the non-cleft group. Whilst jaw function was similar in both groups, a few items, e.g. speech and drinking, were significantly more impaired (P < 0.01) in the CLP group than in the non-cleft group.

806,12851415.0,"Terminology for contractions of muscles during shortening, while isometric, and during lengthening.",J Appl Physiol (1985),"Communication among scientists must be clear and concise to avoid ambiguity and misinterpretations. The selection of words must be based on accepted definitions. The fields of biomechanics, muscle physiology, and exercise science have had a particularly difficult time with terminology, arising from the complexity of muscle contractions and by the use of inappropriate terminology by scientists. The dictionary definition of the verb ""contract,"" specifically for the case of muscle, is ""to undergo an increase in tension, or force, and become shorter."" Under all circumstances, an activated muscle generates force, but an activated muscle generating force does not invariably shorten! During the 1920s and 1930s, investigators recognized that the interaction between the force generated by the muscle and the load on the muscle results in either shortening, no length change (isometric), or lengthening of the muscle. The recognition that muscles perform three different types of ""contractions"" required that contraction be redefined as ""to undergo activation and generate force."" Modifiers of contraction are then needed to clarify the lack of movement or the directionality of movement. Despite the contradiction, for 75 years the lack of movement has been termed an ""isometric contraction."" The directionality of the movement is then best described by the adjectives ""shortening"" and ""lengthening."" The definitions of ""concentric"" as ""having the same center"" and of ""eccentric"" as ""not having the same center"" are consistent with hypertrophy, or remodeling of the heart muscle, but are inappropriate to describe the contractions of skeletal muscles.",2003,95,2,455-9,10.1152/japplphysiol.00280.2003,#3491,Faulkner 2003,
807,30728290.0,Tissue-specific regulation of p53 by PKM2 is redox dependent and provides a therapeutic target for anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.,Sci Transl Med,"Chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity (CIC) is a common clinical problem that compromises effective anticancer therapies. Many chemotherapeutics (including anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin) induce the proapoptotic transcription factor p53 in the tumor and nonspecifically in the heart, promoting heart failure. Although inhibition of p53 shows benefit in preclinical heart failure models, it would not be an attractive adjuvant therapy for CIC, because it would prevent tumor regression. A p53-targeting therapy that would decrease chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the myocardium and, at the same time, enhance apoptosis in the tumor would be ideal. Here, we propose that differences in oxygen tension between the myocardium and the tumor could provide a platform for redox-dependent tissue-specific therapies. We show by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry that the redox-regulated pyruvate kinase muscle 2 (PKM2) directly binds with p53 and that the redox status of cysteine-423 of tetrameric (but not monomeric) PKM2 is critical for the differential regulation of p53 transcriptional activity. Tetrameric PKM2 suppresses p53 transcriptional activity and apoptosis in a high oxidation state but enhances them in a low oxidation one. We show that the oxidation state (along with cysteine-423 oxidation) is higher in the heart compared to the tumor of the same animal. Treatment with TEPP-46 (a compound that stabilizes tetrameric PKM2) suppressed doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, preventing cardiac dysfunction, but enhanced cancer cell apoptosis and tumor regression in the same animals in lung cancer models. Thus, our work suggests that redox-dependent differences in common proteins expressed in the myocardium and tumor can be exploited therapeutically for tissue selectivity in CIC.",2019,11,478,,10.1126/scitranslmed.aau8866,#3492,Saleme 2019,

MFHs also demonstrate a significant baseline heart rate increase and stress-response dampening following alcohol consumption. The present study investigates the specificity of this alcohol-induced psychophysiological response pattern by testing these two risk groups in a shock response paradigm, both sober and alcohol-intoxicated. A repeated measures analysis of variance on sober and alcohol-intoxicated heart rate reactivity yielded a significant risk by alcohol interaction, indicating that alcohol consumption led to a greater decrease in reactivity in the MFH group compared with the HT and FH- groups. Similar results were obtained for muscle tension measures. MFHs also displayed greater increases in resting baseline heart rate and muscle tension when alcohol intoxicated.

Tension measurements, performed on either fresh or 1 day-cultured pulmonary arteries, revealed that the contractile responses to 1 microM 5-hydroxytryptamine were largely relaxed by 20-HETE in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-10 microM). Iberiotoxin pretreatments (10 nM) partially decreased 20-HETE-induced relaxations. However, 10 microM indomethacin and 3 microM SC-560 pretreatments significantly reduced the relaxations to 20-HETE in these tissues. The relaxing responses induced by the eicosanoid were likely related to a reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments since free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+])-response curves performed on beta-escin-permeabilized cultured explants were shifted toward higher [Ca2+]. 20-HETE also abolished the tonic responses induced by phorbol-ester-dibutyrate (a PKC-sensitizing agent). Western blot analyses, using two specific primary antibodies against the PKC-potentiated inhibitory protein CPI-17 and its PKC-dependent phosphorylated isoform pCPI-17, confirmed that 20-HETE interferes with this intracellular process. We also investigated the effect of 20-HETE on the activation of Rho-kinase pathway-induced Ca2+ sensitivity. The data demonstrated that 20-HETE decreased U-46619-induced Ca2+ sensitivity on arteries. Hence, this observation was correlated with an increased staining of p116(Rip), a RhoA-binding protein. Together, these results strongly suggest that the 20-hydroxyarachidonic acid derivative is a potent modulator of tone in HPAs in vitro.",2008,294,3,H1435-43,10.1152/ajpheart.01115.2007,#3495,Morin 2008,
811,19614706.0,Central mechanisms of stress-induced headache.,Cephalalgia,"Stress is the most commonly reported trigger of an episode of chronic tension-type headache (CTTH); however, the causal significance has not been experimentally demonstrated to date. Stress may trigger CTTH through hyperalgesic effects on already sensitized pain pathways in CTTH sufferers. This hypothesis could be partially tested by examining pain sensitivity in an experimental model of stress-induced headache in CTTH sufferers. Such examinations have not been reported to date. We measured pericranial muscle tenderness and pain thresholds at the finger, head and shoulder in 23 CTTH sufferers (CTH-S) and 25 healthy control subjects (CNT) exposed to an hour-long stressful mental task, and in 23 CTTH sufferers exposed to an hour-long neutral condition (CTH-N). Headache developed in 91% of CTH-S, 4% of CNT, and 17% of CTH-N subjects. Headache sufferers had increased muscle tenderness and reduced pain thresholds compared with healthy controls. During the task, muscle tenderness increased and pain thresholds decreased in the CTH-S group compared with CTH-N and CNT groups. Pre-task muscle tenderness and reduction in pain threshold during task were predictive of the development and intensity of headache following task. The main findings are that stress induced a headache in CTTH sufferers, and this was associated with pre-task muscle tenderness and stress-induced reduction in pain thresholds. The results support the hypothesis that stress triggers CTTH through hyperalgesic effects on already increased pain sensitivity in CTTH sufferers, reducing the threshold to noxious input from pericranial structures.",2010,30,3,285-95,10.1111/j.1468-2982.2009.01917.x,#3496,Cathcart 2010,
812,21217059.0,Effects of low-level α-myosin heavy chain expression on contractile kinetics in porcine myocardium.,Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,"Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms are principal determinants of work capacity in mammalian ventricular myocardium. The ventricles of large mammals including humans normally express ∼10% α-MHC on a predominantly β-MHC background, while in failing human ventricles α-MHC is virtually eliminated, suggesting that low-level α-MHC expression in normal myocardium can accelerate the kinetics of contraction and augment systolic function. To test this hypothesis in a model similar to human myocardium we determined composite rate constants of cross-bridge attachment (f(app)) and detachment (g(app)) in porcine myocardium expressing either 100% α-MHC or 100% β-MHC in order to predict the MHC isoform-specific effect on twitch kinetics. Right atrial (∼100% α-MHC) and left ventricular (∼100% β-MHC) tissue was used to measure myosin ATPase activity, isometric force, and the rate constant of force redevelopment (k(tr)) in solutions of varying Ca(2+) concentration. The rate of ATP utilization and k(tr) were approximately ninefold higher in atrial compared with ventricular myocardium, while tension cost was approximately eightfold greater in atrial myocardium. From these values, we calculated f(app) to be ∼10-fold higher in α- compared with β-MHC, while g(app) was 8-fold higher in α-MHC. Mathematical modeling of an isometric twitch using these rate constants predicts that the expression of 10% α-MHC increases the maximal rate of rise of force (dF/dt(max)) by 92% compared with 0% α-MHC. These results suggest that low-level expression of α-MHC significantly accelerates myocardial twitch kinetics, thereby enhancing systolic function in large mammalian myocardium.",2011,300,3,H869-78,10.1152/ajpheart.00452.2010,#3497,Locher 2011,
813,23513056.0,Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells lowers vascular tone by decreasing myosin light chain phosphorylation.,Circ Res,"RATIONALE: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), an oxygen (O2)-sensitive transcription factor, mediates transcriptional responses to low-O2 tension states. Although acute hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction and chronic hypoxia can cause vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension, conflicting data exist on the role of HIF-1α in modulating pulmonary vascular tone. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific HIF-1α in regulating pulmonary vascular tone. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice with an SMC-specific deletion of HIF-1α (SM22α-HIF-1α(-/-)) were created to test the hypothesis that pulmonary artery SMC (PASMC) HIF-1α modulates pulmonary vascular tone and the response to hypoxia. SM22α-HIF-1α(-/-) mice exhibited significantly higher right ventricular systolic pressure compared with wild-type littermates under normoxia and with exposure to either acute or chronic hypoxia in the absence of histological evidence of accentuated vascular remodeling. Moreover, myosin light chain phosphorylation, a determinant of SMC tone, was higher in PASMCs isolated from SM22α-HIF-1α(-/-) mice compared with wild-type PASMCs, during both normoxia and after acute hypoxia. Further, overexpression of HIF-1α decreased myosin light chain phosphorylation in HIF-1α-null SMCs. CONCLUSIONS: In both normoxia and hypoxia, PASMC HIF-1α maintains low pulmonary vascular tone by decreasing myosin light chain phosphorylation. Compromised PASMC HIF-1α expression may contribute to the heightened vasoconstriction that characterizes pulmonary hypertension.",2013,112,9,1230-3,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.300646,#3498,Kim 2013,

Generally considered as separate pathological entities, they have been clinically treated by different means. OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of treatment with botulinum toxin for patients with coexisting TMD and chronic tension type headache. METHODS: In this open-label study of 60 subjects with chronic TMD, 46 subjects also met the diagnostic criteria for chronic tension headache. All 60 subjects were treated with 150 units of botulinum toxin-A injected into the masticatory muscles, specifically 50 units into each masseter and 25 units into each temporalis muscle. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of 60 subjects (63%) reported a 50% improvement in their facial pain during the follow-up period. The subset of 46 subjects with chronic tension headache and TMD symptoms reported a 50% or greater improvement in headache pain as well. The number of headache free days also improved postinjection. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the masticatory muscles, specifically the temporalis, may be involved in the pathogenesis of this form of chronic tension headache found in association with TMD.",2002,42,10,1033-7,10.1046/j.1526-4610.2002.02234.x,#3499,Freund 2002,

Indomethacin, a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor, has been largely used as tocolytic in the treatment of preterm labor. The aim of the present study was to assess a putative synergistic tocolytic effect between the inhibition of the production of prostanoids and stabilization of epoxides fatty acids, particularly arachidonate on spontaneous uterine contractile activity. The experimental work was performed on uterine biopsies from consenting women undergoing elective cesarean delivery at term. Isometric tension measurements were performed on fresh human myometrial strips. Contractile activities have been monitored upon individual and combined treatments of indomethacin, DDMS, an inhibitor of hydroxy-eicosanoids production and AUDA, an inhibitor of epoxy-eicosanoids degradation. Interestingly, a significant and consistent synergic effect was observed when indomethacin and AUDA were simultaneously added, raising the possibility of a combined clinical use of cyclooxygenase and sEH inhibitors in attempt to treat preterm labor.",2011,96,4-Jan,84-9,10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2011.07.004,#3500,Corriveau 2011,
816,9924938.0,"Tension and bending, but not compression alone determine the functional adaptation of subchondral bone in incongruous joints.",Anat Embryol (Berl),"In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that tension and bending, rather than compression alone, determine the functional adaptation of subchondral bone in incongruous joints. We investigated whether tensile stresses in the subchondral bone of the humero-ulnar articulation are affected by the direction of muscle and joint forces, and whether the tensile stresses are large enough to cause microstructural adaptation, specifically a preferential alignment of the trabeculae and the subchondral collagen fibres. Using a previously validated finite element model of the human humero-ulnar joint, we calculated the contact pressure, the principal compressive and tensile stresses, and the strain energy density in the subchondral bone for various flexion angles. A bicentric (ventro-dorsal) pressure distribution was found in the joint at 30 degrees to 120 degrees of flexion, with contact pressures of up to between 2.5 and 3 MPa in the ventral and dorsal aspects of the ulnar joint surface, but less than 0.5 MPa in the centre. The principal tensile stress in the subchondral bone of the trochlear notch quantitatively exceeded the principal compressive stress at low flexion angles (maximum 8.2 MPa), and the distribution of subchondral strain energy density differed substantially from that of the contact stress (r=-0.72 at 30 degrees and r=+0.58 at 90 degrees of flexion). No important tensile stress was computed in the trochlea humeri. On contact radiography, we found sagittally orientated subarticular trabeculae in the notch, running tangential to the surface. Furthermore, we observed sagittally orientated split lines in the subchondral bone of the notch of 20 cadaver joints, suggesting a ventro-dorsal orientation of the collagen fibres. The trochlea humeri, on the other hand, did not show a preferential direction of the subchondral split lines, these findings confirming the predictions of tensile stresses in the model. We conclude that, due to the important contribution of tension to subchondral bone stress, the distribution of subchondral density cannot be directly employed for assessing the long term distribution of joint pressure at the cartilage surface. The magnitude of the tensional stress varies considerably with the direction of the muscle and joint forces, and it appears large enough to cause functional adaptation of the subchondral bone on a microstructural level.",1999,199,1,85-97,10.1007/s004290050212,#3501,Eckstein 1999,
817,15749815.0,"Identification, localization and functional in vitro and in vivo activity of oxytocin receptor in the rat penis.",J Endocrinol,"We recently found that the oxytocin receptor (OTR) is expressed in the human and rabbit corpus cavernosum and mediates contractility in vitro. The present study extended our investigations to the rat, and explored whether OTR regulates penile detumescence in vivo. Real-time RT-PCR quantitatively characterized the distribution of OTR mRNA in the male genital tract. Specific transcripts for OTR were expressed in all the tissues investigated. Penile expression of OTR was comparable to that observed in testis and prostate. Western blot analysis detected a single band of the expected molecular mass for OTR in all tissues examined, including rat penis. Expression of OTR protein in rat penile extracts was further confirmed by binding studies, using the OTR selective radiolabeled ligand 125I-OTA (K(d) = 17 +/- 6.5 pM, B(max)=15.7 +/- 5 fmoles/mg protein). OTR was immunolocalized to the endothelial and smooth muscle compartments of cavernous spaces and blood vessels. In rat corpus cavernosum strips, oxytocin (OT) and an OTR selective agonist ([Thr4,Gly7]OT) induced identical increases in tension, while different vasopressin agonists were less active. In vivo, OT intra-cavernous injection (ICI) dose-dependently inhibited intracavernous pressure (ICP) increase elicited by either electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve or ICI of papaverine with similar IC(50)s (117.7 +/- 37 mU). The OTR antagonist, atosiban, counteracted the contractile effect of OT both in vitro and in vivo. Atosiban alone significantly increased ICP at lower stimulation frequencies (2 Hz = P<0.001 and 4 Hz = P<0.05 vs control), but not at the maximal frequency (16 Hz). Our data showed that OTR is present in the rat penis and mediates contractility both in vitro and in vivo, therefore suggesting a role for OT in maintaining penile detumescence.",2005,184,3,567-76,10.1677/joe.1.05885,#3502,Zhang 2005,
818,27114035.0,A Tension-Based Model Distinguishes Hypertrophic versus Dilated Cardiomyopathy.,Cell,"The heart either hypertrophies or dilates in response to familial mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, which are responsible for contraction and pumping. These mutations typically alter calcium-dependent tension generation within the sarcomeres, but how this translates into the spectrum of hypertrophic versus dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown. By generating a series of cardiac-specific mouse models that permit the systematic tuning of sarcomeric tension generation and calcium fluxing, we identify a significant relationship between the magnitude of tension developed over time and heart growth. When formulated into a computational model, the integral of myofilament tension development predicts hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies in mice associated with essentially any sarcomeric gene mutations, but also accurately predicts human cardiac phenotypes from data generated in induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived myocytes from familial cardiomyopathy patients.

METHODS: Notes of women with detrusor overactivity (DO) and urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) before undergoing tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Patients underwent clinical evaluation pre-operatively including history, examination, and conventional urodynamic studies and were treated with pelvic floor exercises and anti-cholinergic medication. Those with persistent stress urinary incontinence (SUI) underwent TVT. Patients were re-assessed after at least 6 months post-operatively. Pre- and post-operative opening and closing detrusor pressure, and detrusor pressure at maximum flow were recorded retrospectively from pre-operative urodynamics traces by two clinicians independently and compared to the patients' post-operative symptoms and urodynamic diagnosis. RESULTS: Fifty-one women were reviewed. Forty-six of the 51 attended follow-up and 35/51 agreed to conventional urodynamic studies. Seventeen of the 35 reported OAB symptoms, and 18/35 were asymptomatic. Nineteen of the 35 women had DO and 16/35 had normal urodynamic studies (NUDS). The median pre-operative opening detrusor pressure was higher in women with overactive bladder symptoms post-operatively. The median pre-operative opening detrusor pressure in women with DO post-operatively was 33.0 cmH(2)O and the median pre-operative opening detrusor pressure in those with NUDS post-operatively was 16 cmH(2)O (15.0-23.0 cmH(2)O) (P < 0.05 Mann-Whitney U-test).

820,7679159.0,Platelets enhance anoxic contraction of rat aortic rings through platelet-activating factor-dependent mechanism.,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,"Previous studies indicate that anoxia results in vascular smooth muscle contraction, and this phenomenon is mediated in part by a decrease in release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). The role of platelets that relax blood vessels by eliciting EDRF release on anoxic contraction is not known. To examine anoxic contraction in the presence of platelets, we exposed norepinephrine (NE)-precontracted rat aortic rings to washed platelets and then induced anoxia (switch from 95% O2 to 95% N2). Platelets transiently relaxed the precontracted aortic rings (decrease in tension 49 +/- 4%, n = 18). The subsequent anoxia-induced contraction was augmented, however (magnitude of contraction 71 +/- 12 vs. 49 +/- 6% in parallel buffer-treated rings, n = 18, p < 0.01). To determine the mechanism of platelet-mediated augmentation of anoxic contraction, vascular rings were treated with indomethacin, the thromboxane A2 (TxA2)/endoperoxide receptor antagonist SQ29,548, lipoxygenase inhibitor U60,257B, free oxygen radical scavengers superoxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase, serotonin (S2) receptor blocker LY53,857, or the ADP scavenger apyrase. Although apyrase, U60,257B, SQ29,548, LY53,857, and SOD plus catalase had no effect on augmentation of anoxic contraction in the presence of platelets, treatment with indomethacin markedly decreased (p < 0.02) the augmented anoxic vasoconstriction. Because indomethacin decreases the activity of platelet-activating factor (PAF), vascular rings were treated with two different specific PAF receptor antagonists: L-659,989 and WEB 2170 BS. Both these agents blocked the platelet-augmented anoxic vasoconstriction. In addition, synthetic PAF (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) in itself potentiated anoxic contraction, mimicking the activity of platelets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993,21,2,249-55,10.1097/00005344-199302000-00010,#3505,Yang 1993,

Much basic research has been conducted in the area of increasing a muscle's fatigue resistance by neuromuscular electrical stimulation but similarly thorough research with regard to increasing maximal force is missing. Insufficient clinical and basic knowledge exists on the selection of stimulation parameters that will optimize muscle hypertrophy and gains in muscle force. For volitional training, established stimuli for muscle hypertrophy (which more or less parallels maximal muscle force) are muscle tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage. The present review summarizes findings from clinical and basic research in terms of muscle mechanical as well as acute and chronic physiologic effects of different stimulation protocols, explains the role of the various stimulation parameters in determining the effect of NMES training protocols, and gives clinical recommendations for the choice of stimulation parameters for different patient populations with different training goals, such as increasing muscle force, mass, endurance, or energy consumption.

822,26174402.0,Gravitational Effects on Human Physiology.,Subcell Biochem,"Physical working capacity decreases with age and also in microgravity. Regardless of age, increased physical activity can always improve the physical adaptability of the body, although the mechanisms of this adaptability are unknown. Physical exercise produces various mechanical stimuli in the body, and these stimuli may be essential for cell survival in organisms. The cytoskeleton plays an important role in maintaining cell shape and tension development, and in various molecular and/or cellular organelles involved in cellular trafficking. Both intra and extracellular stimuli send signals through the cytoskeleton to the nucleus and modulate gene expression via an intrinsic property, namely the ""dynamic instability"" of cytoskeletal proteins. αB-crystallin is an important chaperone for cytoskeletal proteins in muscle cells. Decreases in the levels of αB-crystallin are specifically associated with a marked decrease in muscle mass (atrophy) in a rat hindlimb suspension model that mimics muscle and bone atrophy that occurs in space and increases with passive stretch. Moreover, immunofluorescence data show complete co-localization of αB-crystallin and the tubulin/microtubule system in myoblast cells. This association was further confirmed in biochemical experiments carried out in vitro showing that αB-crystallin acts as a chaperone for heat-denatured tubulin and prevents microtubule disassembly induced by calcium. Physical activity induces the constitutive expression of αB-crystallin, which helps to maintain the homeostasis of cytoskeleton dynamics in response to gravitational forces. This relationship between chaperone expression levels and regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics observed in slow anti-gravitational muscles as well as in mammalian striated muscles, such as those in the heart, diaphragm and tongue, may have been especially essential for human evolution in particular. Elucidation of the intrinsic properties of the tubulin/microtubule and chaperone αB-crystallin protein complex systems is expected to provide valuable information for high-pressure bioscience and gravity health science.",2015,72,,627-59,10.1007/978-94-017-9918-8_29,#3507,Atomi 2015,

However, the specific receptors involved have not been well characterized. We evaluated whether 5-HT3 receptors exist in human myometrium, and their effects on myometrial contractility when stimulated by a 5-HT3 agonist. METHODS: Four tissue samples taken from patients undergoing hysterectomy (n=2) and elective cesarean delivery (n=2) were used to detect expression of 5-HT3 receptors on the myometrium using western blotting. For isometric tension measurement, another 12 myometrial strips obtained from patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery were randomly divided into a control group (Group CON) and an RS56812 group (Group RG). In increasing doses from 10(-7)M to 10(-4)M, RS56812, a 5-HT3 receptor agonist, was used to investigate the contractile effects after bonding to the 5-HT3 receptor, following which the effects of granisetron were assessed. Amplitude, interval and duration of myometrial contractions were recorded. RESULTS: Proteins with a molecular mass of 55kDa, consistent with 5-HT3 receptors, were detected both on non-pregnant and late-pregnant human uteri. RS56812 increased the contractile amplitude at concentrations of 10(-6)M, 10(-5)M and 10(-4)M, achieving maximum effect at 10(-5)M. A prolonged contractile interval was detected at the concentration of 10(-4)M. However, RS56812 showed no significant effect on contraction duration. Granisetron did not reverse the contractile effects induced by RS56812. CONCLUSION: 5-HT3 receptors are expressed on non-pregnant and pregnant uteri.

This study compared the performance of these two indices using a common corpus of dysphonic speakers. METHOD: Pre- and posttreatment samples of sustained vowel and connected speech were elicited from 112 patients across six diagnostic categories: unilateral vocal fold paralysis (n = 20), adductor spasmodic dysphonia (n = 20), primary muscle tension dysphonia (n = 20), benign vocal fold lesions (n = 20), presbylaryngis (n = 20), and mutational falsetto (n = 12). Listener ratings of dysphonia severity were compared to acoustic estimates of severity derived from two iterations of the AVQI (versions 2.02 and 3.01) as well as the CSID. RESULTS: The AVQI- and CSID-estimated severity for sustained vowels, connected speech, and a combined context were strongly correlated and significantly associated with listener ratings pretreatment, posttreatment, and change observed pre- to posttreatment. However, multiple regression analysis (adjusted for age, sex, and diagnostic category) revealed that the CSID generally accounted for more variance in listener-perceived severity ratings, and the contribution of the AVQI was small and statistically insignificant when the CSID was already in a combined model. CONCLUSIONS: The AVQI and the CSID were strongly correlated and both provided valid estimates of dysphonia severity.

A total of eight (100%) patients were also cured of concomitant stress incontinence (five overt and three occult type) with an additional tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) operation. During follow-up, there were five de-novo stress incontinence cases (16.7%) and four vaginal erosions of mesh (10.5%). Four clinical variables--diabetes mellitus, recurrent anterior vaginal prolapse, chronic cough and vaginal erosions of mesh--were found to have a significant correlation with an unsatisfactory surgical result with large values of hazard ratios found by survival analysis. We concluded that the anterior colporrhaphy procedure reinforced with four-corner anchored polypropylene mesh was effective for most, but failed in some patients who had specific risk factors within short convalescence periods. Concomitant stress incontinence can be successfully treated by a TVT operation in combination with the anterior colporrhaphy procedure reinforced with four-corner anchored polypropylene mesh. However, the anterior colporrhaphy procedure may itself have adverse effects on urethral sphincter function.",2004,15,6,399-406; discussion 406,10.1007/s00192-004-1185-1,#3512,Hung 2004,
828,10725770.0,Post-natal modulation of heart and liver phosphoglyceride fatty acids in pups.,Ann Nutr Metab,"BACKGROUND: Maternal dietary fats alter tissue fatty acids of the fetus and suckling pups. However, the possible change in tissue composition in response to the high oxygen tension extrauterine milieu independent of diet is not well understood. METHODS: We have compared the fatty acids of heart and liver choline (CPG) and ethanolamine (EPG) phosphoglycerides of rat offspring at birth and post-natal day 15. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a breeding diet prior to mating, pregnancy and lactation. A proportion of each litter was sacrificed and the liver and heart were obtained for analysis. Changes in fatty acid composition specific to tissue (heart and liver) and phosphoglyceride (CPG and EPG) occurred post-natally. RESULTS: Relative levels of palmitate and oleate decreased and those of stearate increased in both the heart and liver phosphoglycerides of the suckling pups. There was a reduction in arachidonate/linoleate ratio primarily due to the increase in linoleic acid. With the exception in the heart EPG, the levels of arachidonic acid did not decrease concomitantly. Although the fatty acid composition of the diet did not change between pregnancy and lactation, docosahexaenoic and total n-3 increased in heart CPG and EPG and liver CPG of the suckling pups. Evidently, membrane fatty acid modulation, independent of maternal dietary fat, occurs in the extrauterine environment. It seems to favour the accretion of linoleic, arachidonic, docosahexaenoic and total n-3 fatty acids. CONCLUSION: Since there appears to be some parallel between the very preterm human neonate and rat pups with regard to nutrient store at birth and the neonatal developmental time window, our results may have relevance for the understanding of fatty acid metabolism and turnover in the human neonate.",1999,43,6,365-73,10.1159/000012805,#3513,Ghebremeskel 1999,
829,1655456.0,The Ca-channel as cardiac autoantigen.,Eur Heart J,"We recently described autoantibodies to the ADP/ATP carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane as an organ specific autoantigen found in high frequencies in sera of patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. These antibodies not only showed an intracellular binding at the mitochondrial membrane, but also crossreact with antigenic determinants at the cardiac myocyte plasma membrane. They therefore may account, at least in part, for the so-called sarcolemmal-bound IgG of heart-reactive autoantibodies found to be associated with these diseases. Heart muscle diseases are associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities such as complex ventricular arrhythmias and disturbed ventricular function. Our data indicate that abnormalities in current spread and impaired heart contractility might also be caused by an antibody mediated disturbance of calcium channel gating leading to prolongation of the action potential and potentiation of tension. The enhanced calcium permeability of the cell may moreover cause calcium overload and cell death. The calcium channel complex plays a central role in cardiac contractility. Disturbing calcium channel gating by antibodies might therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases.",1991,12 Suppl D,,99-104,10.1093/eurheartj/12.suppl_d.99,#3514,KÃ¼hl 1991,

METHODS: Isometric tension recording was performed under physiologic conditions in isolated myometrial strips obtained from 33 women undergoing hysterectomy or either elective or emergency cesarean section. The effects of cumulative additions of nimesulide, meloxicam, and celecoxib (between 1 nmol/L and 100 micromol/L) on myometrial contractility were measured, and values for -log(10) EC(50) and mean maximal inhibition were compared. RESULTS: Nimesulide, meloxicam, and celecoxib exerted significant relaxant effects on contractility in nonpregnant, pregnant nonlabor, and pregnant labor myometrial strips. Values for -log(10) EC(50) values (+/- standard error of the mean) were as follows: nimesulide (nonpregnant) 5.14 +/- 0.93 (n = 6), (pregnant nonlabor) 4.91 +/- 0.75 (n = 6), and (pregnant labor) 5.84 +/- 0.35 (n = 6); meloxicam (nonpregnant) 6.53 +/- 0.57 (n = 6), (pregnant nonlabor) 4.80 +/- 0.71 (n = 6), and (pregnant labor) 5.62 +/- 0.21 (n = 6); celecoxib (nonpregnant) 6.15 +/- 0.99 (n = 6), (pregnant nonlabor) 7.08 +/- 0.98 (n = 6), and (pregnant labor) 7.25 +/- 0.99 (n = 3). Celecoxib exhibited greater potency than nimesulide or meloxicam (P < .01). The range of maximal relaxation values achieved in the three tissue types were as follows: nimesulide 68-70% (n = 18; P < .01), meloxicam 69-84% (n = 18; P < .01), and celecoxib 69-77% (n = 15; P < .01). CONCLUSION: COX-2 inhibitors exert significant relaxation in human myometrium with a similar potency in nonpregnant and pregnant (before and after labor onset) tissues. Celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, was more potent than nimesulide or meloxicam, COX-2 preferential inhibitors.",2001,98,4,563-9,10.1016/s0029-7844(01)01522-8,#3515,Slattery 2001,

The clear definition, however, of a ""tension headache"" complex and its differentiation from migraine in some patients is difficult. The problems are in the identification of a specific headache pattern induced by stress or ""tension"" and the relationship of the symptom to involuntary contraction of neck and scalp muscles.

832,23639283.0,Correcting lenticular astigmatism by reinstating the correct neuromuscular message.,Med Hypotheses,"THE PROBLEM: The spasm of the oblique muscles can contribute to lenticular astigmatism. The visual cortex interprets the tension of the oblique muscles as an eye that is in near focus mode. It overrides the response to the information generated by depth perception to bring a distant image into focus. Any excessive effort to bring it into focus will not be successful and continuing to make that effort can cause a misalignment in the tension of the rectus muscles. This in turn can directly induce corneal astigmatism and indirectly induce lenticular astigmatism. The astigmatic eye can still bring a near image into focus, but a distant image remains aberrant. METHODOLOGY: The design of a special contact lens to treat lenticular astigmatism is similar to the design of a contact lens to treat corneal astigmatism by means of orthoculogy (or ortho C) as outlined in the paper Correcting Corneal Astigmatism by Reinstating the Correct Neuromuscular Message. The ortho C lens is worn for about two minutes to attend to the blur and distorted aspects of ""simple myopic astigmatism"". Both of these refractive errors are corrected simultaneously. RESULTS: Once the oblique muscles become ""loose"" due to a ""contact lens draw"", it triggers the visual cortex to reinstate the proper neuromotor message to stimulate the ciliary muscle (the muscle that controls the shape of the crystalline lens) to relax along a certain meridian-which in turn ""flattens"" the crystalline lens along that meridian to bring a blur and distorted image in the distance into focus. The correction only takes a few minutes because the ciliary muscle of an astigmatic eye was not compromised. CONCLUSION: The correction is not strictly due to an ortho C lens. Its design is the same for corneal astigmatism or lenticular astigmatism. The purpose of the design is to ""loosen"" the oblique muscles in a certain manner depending on the degree of astigmatism instead of a specific type of astigmatism. The visual cortex can discriminate whether to correct for corneal astigmatism or lenticular astigmatism after the ""draw"" from the lens relaxes the oblique muscles.",2013,81,1,36-40,10.1016/j.mehy.2013.03.041,#3517,Yee 2013,
833,16978836.0,Considerations for maintenance of postural alignment for voice production.,J Voice,"There is general agreement that postural alignment is important in optimizing voice function. A number of articles have illuminated the way in which posture, particularly of the cervical spine, is directly related to vocal resonance and pitch control. Despite frequent involvement in muscle training, few speech pathologists have the background in exercise physiology necessary to appreciate the contribution of muscular length-tension relationships to postural alignment. The purpose of this article is to provide voice therapists with information to help them formulate appropriate recommendations for improving postural alignment. This article synthesizes information from the literature regarding the role of muscular length-tension balance in the attainment and maintenance of postural alignment. Important considerations in the assessment of muscle tension and weakness are presented along with advice regarding application to the treatment of voice-disordered patients. Concepts detailed include agonist/antagonist relationships, the biomechanics of stretching, postural assessment, and the relationship between muscle tension and muscle weakness. The role of both stretching and strength-based training is discussed. Specific exercises with emphasis on altering the alignment of the cervical and thoracic spine are presented with suggestions for their use in the clinic. There is growing understanding of the physiology behind recommendations of voice teachers and therapists to maintain optimal alignment. To effectively mediate postural misalignment, clinicians must have knowledge of the length-tension relationships between muscles. This understanding will lead to better interventions for postural alignment.",2008,22,1,90-9,10.1016/j.jvoice.2006.08.001,#3518,WilsonArboleda 2008,

Healthy cells also exhibit a wide range of membrane cortical tensions, which have been studied in the field of mechanobiology. Here, we quantify the mechanosensitivity of the lysis agent the di-rhamnolipid (RHA), which is a bacterially produced biosurfactant. RHA exhibited selective lysis correlated strongly with cortical membrane tension in osteoblasts, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and erythrocytes. Reducing cortical membrane tension by cytoskeleton inhibitors (cytochalasin D and nocodazole) or osmotic regulators (sucrose, polyethylene glycol, and nonionic surfactants) attenuated the RHA toxicity. The selective toxicity of RHA toward human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells over healthy blood cells suggests a potential therapy for blood cancer. Targeted killing of myofibroblasts transformed from either fibroblasts or epithelial cells indicates its antifibrotic effect. Combined, these studies showed the potential for specific targeting of cells with differential mechanical properties rather than chemical or biological pathways.",2020,6,1,352-357,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b01305,#3520,Shen 2020,biosurfactant
836,28436080.0,Genotype-specific pathogenic effects in human dilated cardiomyopathy.,J Physiol,"KEY POINTS: Mutations in genes encoding cardiac troponin I (TNNI3) and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) caused altered troponin protein stoichiometry in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. TNNI3(p.98trunc) resulted in haploinsufficiency, increased Ca(2+) -sensitivity and reduced length-dependent activation. TNNT2(p.K217del) caused increased passive tension. A mutation in the gene encoding Lamin A/C (LMNA(p.R331Q) ) led to reduced maximal force development through secondary disease remodelling in patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy. Our study shows that different gene mutations induce dilated cardiomyopathy via diverse cellular pathways. ABSTRACT: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can be caused by mutations in sarcomeric and non-sarcomeric genes. In this study we defined the pathogenic effects of three DCM-causing mutations: the sarcomeric mutations in genes encoding cardiac troponin I (TNNI3(p.98truncation) ) and cardiac troponin T (TNNT2(p.K217deletion) ; also known as the p.K210del) and the non-sarcomeric gene mutation encoding lamin A/C (LMNA(p.R331Q) ). We assessed sarcomeric protein expression and phosphorylation and contractile behaviour in single membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes in human left ventricular heart tissue. Exchange with recombinant troponin complex was used to establish the direct pathogenic effects of the mutations in TNNI3 and TNNT2. The TNNI3(p.98trunc) and TNNT2(p.K217del) mutation showed reduced expression of troponin I to 39% and 51%, troponin T to 64% and 53%, and troponin C to 73% and 97% of controls, respectively, and altered stoichiometry between the three cardiac troponin subunits. The TNNI3(p.98trunc) showed pure haploinsufficiency, increased Ca(2+) -sensitivity and impaired length-dependent activation. The TNNT2(p.K217del) mutation showed a significant increase in passive tension that was not due to changes in titin isoform composition or phosphorylation. Exchange with wild-type troponin complex corrected troponin protein levels to 83% of controls in the TNNI3(p.98trunc) sample. Moreover, upon exchange all functional deficits in the TNNI3(p.98trunc) and TNNT2(p.K217del) samples were normalized to control values confirming the pathogenic effects of the troponin mutations. The LMNA(p.R331Q) mutation resulted in reduced maximal force development due to disease remodelling.

Normal bladders were obtained from children with vesicoureteral reflux undergoing ureteral reimplantation. Myelodysplastic bladder specimens were obtained from patients undergoing bladder augmentation. The functional studies included agonist (calcium chloride) dose response experiments and the determination of apparent antagonist dissociation constants for various calcium channel antagonists. The receptor binding studies were performed using the ligand (+)-3H-PN200-110 (specific activity 86.6 Ci./mmol.). The mean maximal response of myelodysplastic bladders to calcium ions was 31% less than normal bladders (p greater than 0.05). The mean EC50 for calcium mediated isometric tension and the mean -log antagonist dissociation constant values of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil were similar in normal and myelodysplastic bladders. The radioligand receptor binding studies demonstrated that the equilibrium dissociation constant of (+)-3H-PN200-110 in myelodysplastic bladders was 4-fold greater than in normal bladders. The density of dihydropyridine binding sites in myelodysplastic and normal bladders was similar. Our study demonstrated that the pathophysiology of the poorly compliant hyperreflexic bladder is not related to up regulation of dihydropyridine calcium channel receptors or alterations in the response of detrusor muscle to calcium ions. The relative abundance of calcium channel receptors in the normal and myelodysplastic bladders, and the regulation of detrusor contraction by calcium ions suggest that calcium channel receptors have a meaningful role in detrusor function.",1991,146,2 ( Pt 2),520-3,10.1016/s0022-5347(17)37842-4,#3522,Shapiro 1991,

Results of a standardized therapeutic evaluation applying objective methods for measuring pain pressure threshold, pain pressure tolerance and muscle tension].",MMW Fortschr Med,"BACKGROUND: Chronic back pain is mainly caused by painful tension in the back muscles. Thus, analgesics with muscle tone decreasing effects that apparently normalize increased muscle tonus through specific modes of action without disturbing normal muscular movement are an important therapeutic option. Flupirtine retard (Katadolon S long) has provided such an option since 2006. OBJECTIVES: To impartially evaluate the muscle tonus normalizing effects of flupirtine retard by applying specific, objective test methods in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain under routine practice conditions. METHODS: Prospective standardized evaluation of a treatment with flupirtine retard in 30 patients with continuous chronic, therapy refractory back pain. Measurement of general pain intensity, pain pressure threshold and pain pressure tolerance for trigger-point related pain and muscle tension in the affected back muscles before and during flupirtine retard treatment were performed in a standardized manner. RESULTS: In comparison to the reproducible, constant initial values, the two-week treatment with flupirtine retard led to a significant improvement in all measured muscle-specific indicators: pain pressure threshold (+48%), pain pressure tolerance (+27%) and depth of penetration in the muscle (+18%) (all values p < 0.001). These were also correlated with a clinically observable and statistically significant pain relief from an initial level of 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 3.0 +/- 1.4. CONCLUSION: Flupirtine retard was shown to be a useful, effective and very tolerable therapeutic option for patients with chronic back pain. The improvement of muscle disturbances which are responsible for the pain in addition to pain relief was shown firstly by objective measure methods.",2008,149 Suppl 4,,153-61,,#3523,MÃ¼ller-Schwefe 2008,
839,27555315.0,The combination tocolytic effect of magnesium sulfate and an oxytocin receptor antagonist in myometrium from singleton and twin pregnancies.,Am J Obstet Gynecol,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth at <37 weeks of gestation is the most common and costly complication of pregnancy and remains the leading cause of neonatal morbidity, death, and reduced achievement in surviving infants. Magnesium sulfate is 1 class of tocolytics for threatened preterm labor; however, its clinical efficacy has been questioned. Twin pregnancies are at increased risk of preterm delivery compared with singleton gestations, which suggests that there is twin-specific risk to preterm delivery in twins. The prevention strategies that are applied to singleton pregnancies, however, have not been shown to be effective in twin pregnancies. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the relaxant effect of magnesium sulfate on spontaneous and oxytocin-augmented contractions of human myometrium from singleton and twin pregnancies and to examine whether the effect of oxytocin on magnesium sulfate's potency could be reversed with the use of the oxytocin receptor antagonist, atosiban. STUDY DESIGN: Myometrium was obtained at the time of prelabor cesarean section (36-40 weeks of gestation) from women with singleton (n=23) or twin (n=12) pregnancy. Isometric tension recordings were made on myometrial strips that were mounted in organ baths that were superfused with physiologic saline solution. Strips were exposed to rising concentrations of magnesium sulfate, and the effect on spontaneous contractions or stimulated with oxytocin (0.5 nmol/L) and in the presence or absence of atosiban (100 nmol/L) was recorded. The contractile characteristics after each application of magnesium sulfate, which included amplitude of contraction and activity integral, were measured. Concentration-response curves were fitted with the use of nonlinear regression and comparison of the negative logarithm of the 50% reduction in activity values. RESULTS: Magnesium sulfate exerted an equal concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on spontaneous myometrial contractions from both singleton and twin myometrium (P>.05). The application of oxytocin produced a significant rightward shift in the concentration-response curves (P<.0001), but no differences were found between pregnancy groups (P>.05). The addition of atosiban shifted concentration-response curves significantly back to the left for amplitude of contraction and activity integral in singletons (P<.0001). However, only activity integral was significantly reversed in twins (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Magnesium sulfate is equipotent in suppressing contractions in singleton and twin myometrium. Oxytocin (0.5 nmol/L) significantly reduces the tocolytic potency of magnesium sulfate, which may explain, in part, magnesium sulfate's poor efficacy in vivo; however, this can be reversed partially by the use of an oxytocin receptor antagonist. Combination tocolysis that involves oxytocin receptor antagonists requires further investigation.",2016,215,6,789.e1-789.e9,10.1016/j.ajog.2016.08.015,#3524,Arrowsmith 2016,MgSO(4)

The research question here is whether the correlations between Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-30 scores and objective acoustic measures differ in patients with different types of voice disorders. METHODS: The subjects were divided into three groups: muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), benign mid-membranous vocal fold lesions, and unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). All participants were male. The mean age for the groups were 32.85 ± 8.6 years in the MTD group, 33.24 ± 7.32 years in the benign lesions group, and 34.24 ± 7.51 years in the UVFP group. The participants completed the Persian VHI-30 questionnaire. PRAAT software was used to obtain acoustic analyses. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the physical subscale of the VHI-30 and the total score of the VHI-30 and maximum phonation time (MPT) in the MTD group. Also, there was a significant correlation between the total VHI-30 score and the MPT value. There were relatively strong and significant correlations between the physical subscale of the VHI-30 with jitter and shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) for the group with benign lesions such as nodules and polyps. Also, in this group, there was a significant correlation between the total VHI-30 score and the jitter value. The physical scale had strong and significant correlations between jitter, shimmer, and HNR in the unilateral paralysis group.

This study examines the effects of voice sound pressure level (SPL) on jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) in adults with voice disorders and a control group with normal vocal status. STUDY DESIGN: This is a matched case-control study. METHODS: We assessed 58 adult female voice patients matched according to approximate age and occupation with 58 vocally healthy women. Diagnoses included vocal fold nodules (n = 39, 67.2%), polyps (n = 5, 8.6%), and muscle tension dysphonia (n = 14, 24.1%). All participants sustained the vowel /a/ at soft, comfortable, and loud phonation levels. Acoustic voice SPL, jitter, shimmer, and HNR were computed using Praat. The effects of loudness condition, voice SPL, pathology, differential diagnosis, age, and professional voice use level on acoustic perturbation measures were assessed using linear mixed models and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. RESULTS: In both patient and normative control groups, increasing voice SPL correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with decreased jitter and shimmer, and increased HNR. Voice pathology and differential diagnosis were not linked to systematically higher jitter and shimmer. HNR levels, however, were statistically higher in the patient group than in the control group at comfortable phonation levels. Professional voice use level had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on jitter, shimmer, and HNR. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical value of acoustic jitter, shimmer, and HNR may be limited if speaking voice SPL and professional voice use level effects are not controlled for. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether perturbation measures are useful clinical outcome metrics when controlling for these effects.",2018,32,2,162-168,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.04.008,#3526,Brockmann-Bauser 2018,Acoustic perturbation

To determine the specific functional effects of the cTnT PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites (Thr197, Ser201, Thr206, and Thr287) we first mutated these residues to glutamate (E) or alanine (A). cTnT was selectively mutated to generate single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants. Bacterially expressed mutants were evaluated in detergent-treated mouse left ventricular papillary muscle fiber bundles where the endogenous troponin was replaced with a recombinant troponin complex containing either cTnT phosphorylated by PKC-alpha or a mutant cTnT. We simultaneously determined isometric tension development and actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity of the exchanged fiber bundles as a function of Ca2+ concentration. Our systematic analysis of the functional role of the multiple PKC phosphorylation sites on cTnT identified a localized region that controls maximum tension, ATPase activity, and Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments. An important and novel finding of our study was that Thr206 is a functionally critical cTnT PKC phosphorylation residue. Its exclusive phosphorylation by PKC-alpha or replacement by Glu (mimicking phosphorylation) significantly decreased maximum tension, actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity, myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, and cooperativity. On the other hand the charge modification of the other three residues together (T197/S201/T287-E) had no functional effect. Fibers bundles containing phosphorylated cTnT-wt (but not the T197/S201/T206/T287-E) exhibited a significant decrease of tension cost as compared with cTnT-wt.",2003,278,37,35135-44,10.1074/jbc.M306325200,#3527,Sumandea 2003,
843,28318967.0,Pitch Strength as an Outcome Measure for Treatment of Dysphonia.,J Voice,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of treatment outcomes is critical for the spectrum of voice treatments (ie, surgical, behavioral, or pharmacological). Outcome measures typically include visual (eg, stroboscopic data), auditory (eg, Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice; Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain), and objective correlates of vocal fold vibratory characteristics, such as acoustic signals (eg, harmonics-to-noise ratio, cepstral peak prominence) or patient self-reported questionnaires (eg, Voice Handicap Index, Voice-Related Quality of Life). Subjective measures often show high variability, whereas most acoustic measures of voice are only valid for signals where some degree of periodicity can be assumed. However, this assumption is often invalid for dysphonic voices where signal periodicity is suspect. Furthermore, many of these measures are not useful in isolation for diagnostic purposes. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated a recently developed algorithm (Auditory Sawtooth Waveform Inspired Pitch Estimator-Prime [Auditory-SWIPE']) for estimating pitch and pitch strength for dysphonic voices. Whereas fundamental frequency is a physical attribute of a signal, pitch is its psychophysical correlate. As such, the perception of pitch can extend to most signals irrespective of their periodicity. METHODS: Post hoc analyses were conducted for three groups of patients evaluated and treated for voice problems at a major voice center: (1) muscle tension dysphonia/functional dysphonia, (2) vocal fold mass(es), and (3) presbyphonia. All patients were recorded before and after surgical/behavioral treatment for voice disorders. Pitch and pitch strength for each speaker were computed with the Auditory-SWIPE' algorithm. RESULTS: Comparison of pre- and posttreatment data provides support for pitch strength as a measure of treatment outcomes for dysphonic voices.",2017,31,6,691-696,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.01.016,#3528,Kopf 2017,Acoustic analysis

However, recent work has shown that up to 4 phosphate groups are present in human cMyBP-C. OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize additional phosphorylation sites in human cMyBP-C. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiac MyBP-C was semipurified from human heart tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified a novel phosphorylation site on serine 133 in the proline-alanine-rich linker sequence between the C0 and C1 domains of cMyBP-C. Unlike the known sites, Ser133 was not a target of protein kinase A. In silico kinase prediction revealed glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) as the most likely kinase to phosphorylate Ser133. In vitro incubation of the C0C2 fragment of cMyBP-C with GSK3β showed phosphorylation on Ser133. In addition, GSK3β phosphorylated Ser304, although the degree of phosphorylation was less compared with protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation at Ser304. GSK3β treatment of single membrane-permeabilized human cardiomyocytes significantly enhanced the maximal rate of tension redevelopment. CONCLUSIONS: GSK3β phosphorylates cMyBP-C on a novel site, which is positioned in the proline-alanine-rich region and increases kinetics of force development, suggesting a noncanonical role for GSK3β at the sarcomere level. Phosphorylation of Ser133 in the linker domain of cMyBP-C may be a novel mechanism to regulate sarcomere kinetics.",2013,112,4,633-9,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.112.275602,#3529,Kuster 2013,
845,2288233.0,"The relation between response-specificity, S-R compatibility, foreperiod duration and muscle-tension in a target aiming task.",Acta Psychol (Amst),"Three experiments are reported aiming at a further understanding of the effect of response-specificity, operationalized as the degree of commonality of direction of movements. In a previous study, Spijkers (1987) has claimed that response-specificity affects the readiness of the motor system and is not related to response-selection processes. These suppositions were generally confirmed in experiments 1 and 2 respectively. Common to both experiments were the variables average movement velocity and response-specificity. In experiment 1 the effect of the additional variable foreperiod duration was found to interact with that of response-specificity, hereby confirming its expected relation to the muscular system. The effect of response-specificity did not interact with that of spatial S-R compatibility in the second experiment, but also failed to show a main effect. The third experiment examined the supposed relation of response-specificity more directly through manipulation of the muscle-tension of the responding limb. The predicted form of the interaction between the effect of response-specificity and muscle-tension was confirmed which provided additional evidence for the interpretation of response-specificity effects in terms of differential muscular activation.",1990,75,3,261-77,10.1016/0001-6918(90)90016-9,#3530,Spijkers 1990,
846,9672082.0,Tensions of the flexor digitorum superficialis are higher than a current model predicts.,J Biomech,"Existing isometric force models can be used to predict tension in the finger flexor tendon, however, they assume a specific distribution of forces across the tendons of the fingers. These assumptions have not been validated or explored by experimental methods. To determine if the force distributions repeatably follow one pattern the in vivo tension of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon of the long finger was measured in nine patients undergoing open carpal tunnel release surgery. Following the release, a tendon force transducer (Dennerlein et al. 1997 J. Biomechanics 30(4), 395-397) was mounted onto the FDS of the long finger. Tension in the tendon, contact force at the fingertip, and finger posture were recorded while the patient gradually increased the force applied by the fingertip from 0 to 10 N and then monotonically reduced it to 0 N. The average ratio of the tendon tension to the fingertip contact force ranged from 1.7 to 5.8 (mean = 3.3, s.d. = 1.4) for the nine subjects. These ratios are larger than ratios predicted by current isometric tendon force models (mean = 1.2, s. d. = 0.4). Subjects who used a pulp pinch posture (hyper-extended distal interphalangeal joint (DIP)) showed a significantly (p = 0.02) larger ratio (mean = 4.4, s.d. = 1.5) than the five subjects who flexed the DIP joint in a tip pinch posture (mean = 2.4, s.d. = 0.6). A new DIP constraint model, which selects different force distribution based on DIP joint posture, predicts force ratios that correlate well with the measured ratios (r2 = 0.85).",1998,31,4,295-301,10.1016/s0021-9290(98)00006-2,#3531,Dennerlein 1998,
847,10957928.0,An overview of the upper esophageal sphincter.,Curr Gastroenterol Rep,"The anatomy and physiology of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) are complex. Much progress has been made over the past few years in our understanding this important sphincter. The closing muscles of the UES include the inferior pharyngeal sphincter, the cricopharyngeus (CP), and the cervical esophagus. The CP is composed of two parts, which may have different functions. The CP is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Tone of the UES is probably generated by numerous reflexes rather than by specific tone-generating circuitry. The major tone-generating muscle is the CP, which is highly elastic and produces more active tension the more it is stretched. The UES opens by relaxation of the closing muscles, traction by muscles attached to the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage, and pulsion of the bolus. The various muscles of the UES behave differently during its many dynamic states, so that similar functions are accomplished by different muscles.",2000,2,3,185-90,10.1007/s11894-000-0059-z,#3532,Lang 2000,

Specifically, electromyographic (EMG) data were collected from the forearm flexor muscles of workers performing a highly repetitive task. This task had previously been identified as one that involved a high incidence of cumulative trauma disorders. Workers were asked to increase and decrease their work pace for short periods of time. The EMG data indicated that faster work paces were accompanied by higher forces. However, it was also noted that unsuccessful attempts to speedup or slowdown produced similar increases and decreases in EMG activity, indicating that speed of movement was not the only factor contributing to the changes in muscular activity. The results are discussed in relation to the stress and tension associated with work pressure caused by machine pacing, production standards, and incentive systems.",1987,12,5 Pt 2,866-9,10.1016/s0363-5023(87)80251-4,#3533,Arndt 1987,
849,11834720.0,Early expression of myocardial HIF-1alpha in response to mechanical stresses: regulation by stretch-activated channels and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway.,Circ Res,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in ischemic tissues and growing tumors. Normally, HIF-1 activity depends on the amount of HIF-1alpha subunit, which is tightly regulated by the oxygen tension. In the myocardium, VEGF expression has been shown to be induced under nonhypoxic conditions by mechanical stresses. However, the cellular mechanism of stress-mediated VEGF induction remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the possible involvement of HIF-1 in stress-mediated VEGF induction in rat hearts. In this study, we increased the left ventricular wall tension using 3 different methods, namely by inducing regional ischemia, by expanding an intraventricular balloon, and by producing hemodynamic overload using an aortocaval shunt. In all cases, HIF-1alpha accumulated in the nuclei of cardiac myocytes in the early phase, and this was followed by VEGF induction. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt phosphorylation was found to be activated by mechanical stress and completely blocked by wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor). Moreover, the stress-mediated induction of HIF-1alpha and VEGF was suppressed by gadolinium (a stretch-activated channel inhibitor), wortmannin, and rapamycin (a FRAP inhibitor). Our results suggest that HIF-1alpha plays an important role in the induction of VEGF in nonischemic and mechanically stressed myocardium, and that this is regulated by stretch-activated channels and the PI3K/Akt/FRAP pathway. Moreover, this signaling pathway, which induces HIF-1alpha, seems to play an important role in the adaptation of the myocardium to stresses.

This work was performed to investigate the existence of calcium-independent contraction in this smooth-muscle-like tissue and its modulation by targeting the rho-guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-mediated pathway. METHODS: Isometric tension measurements of bovine TM and ciliary muscle (CM) were performed. Intra- and extracellular calcium buffering was accomplished with EGTA and 1, 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N:,N:,N:',N:'-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis/acetoxymethhyl ester (BAPTA-AM) followed by stimulation of PKC with phorbolester (PMA) or 4alpha-phorbol. Calcium-independent contraction was blocked using the highly specific ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation was performed using human TM cells. RESULTS: In TM, carbachol induced partial contraction under conditions of extracellular calcium depletion (22. 1% +/- 2.3% versus 100%, n = 9). The membrane-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM completely blocked this response (1.1% +/- 1.4% versus 100%, n = 9). When calcium was completely blocked, PMA induced contraction in TM (16.7% +/- 5.9% versus 100%, n = 9) but not in CM (1.8% +/- 2.5% versus 100%, n = 6). The inactive PMA analogue 4alpha-phorbol did not induce contraction, indicating that activation of PKC is involved in this contractile response. The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 completely blocked the calcium-independent PMA-induced contraction in TM. Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation revealed the expression of the rho-A protein in human TM cells. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that contrary to CM, the TM features calcium-independent contractile mechanisms linked to rho-A and PKC isoforms that do not require calcium for activation. ROCK inhibitors may allow specific modulation of the TM to enhance outflow facility, thus lowering intraocular pressure.",2000,41,13,4240-6,,#3535,Thieme 2000,

However, this form of therapy has failed to focus on the role of cognitive variables in the control and perception of tension headache. The present case study provides a prototype treatment combining cognitive behavior--modification procedures with EMG-biofeedback training to treat a subject with chronic tension headache. Phase I, baseline, involved collecting mean EMG and daily headache activity, emphasizing specification of environmental stressors. Phase II, cognitive skills--training, focused on: (1) identifying negative self-statements (cognitions) related to stressors, and (2) training the subject to replace negative self-statements with coping self-instructions. This treatment resulted in a 33% headache reduction over baseline, with no concomitant changes in frontalis EMG. Phase III, EMG-biofeedback training, resulted in a 38% reduction in mean EMG level and a 66% reduction in mean headache activity when compared to baseline.

852,17577593.0,Adductor brevis myositis following transobturator tape procedure: a case report and review of the literature.,Int Urogynecol J Pelvic Floor Dysfunct,"The tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) procedure has long been considered the gold standard for female stress incontinence. Since its introduction in 1995, several other tapes and other minimally invasive treatments have arisen. The transobturator tape (TOT) procedure reproduces the natural suspension of the urethra through the obturator and puborectalis muscles. The TOT procedure was reportedly developed in an effort to prevent bladder perforation associated with the TVT and is generally considered to be a procedure with low morbidity. At our institution, we report the first case of infected mesh with subsequent myositis of adductor muscles after a TOT procedure. To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting this complication, citing specifically that the anatomical structures traversed by the tape, including both muscle and fascia, can be at risk for infection and ultimately require removal of the sling material. We performed a MEDLINE literature search using key words such as ""transobturator tape,"" ""tension free vaginal tape,"" and ""adductor and obturator complications"" to ascertain any reported adductor or obturator muscle complications after placement of TOT. Further, we reviewed the literature to elucidate the consequences of using different mesh materials, specifically their effects on erosion. We reported our case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with right-leg cellulitis and vaginal discharge after having a TOT placed for stress incontinence. Inflammation of the adductor muscles was demonstrated on computed tomography (CT) scan and ultrasound. On physical exam, the mesh had visibly eroded through the vaginal wall. Our patient underwent excision of the mesh material. She ultimately had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home in good condition on the postoperative day 2. The mesh material removed was ObTape. We believe our study is the first case report to discuss the complication of infected adductor muscles and erosion of the tape during post-TOT procedure. After a careful review of the literature, there is no mention of myositis of adductor muscles as a possible complication after the TOT procedure. In fact, the literature has deemed this minimally invasive treatment as a safe and effective procedure with minimal complications including only de novo urgency or urinary retention. The site of infection is of particular interest and can be explained by the course through the anatomical structures that are unique to this particular procedure. Ultimately, the treatment for this procedure was the removal of the mesh along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. In conclusion, the burden falls upon the surgeons to report in a timely fashion both successes and complication for the TOT procedure given their relatively limited experience. This is paramount in determining patients' risks.",2007,18,7,817-20,10.1007/s00192-006-0220-9,#3537,DeSouza 2007,

PI3K/p110α controls cellular wound healing pathways, thereby representing an emerging drug target to modulate vascular homoeostasis after injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: PI3K/p110α was inhibited by treatment with the small molecule inhibitor PIK75 or a specific siRNA. Arterial thrombosis, neointima formation, and re-endothelialization were studied in a murine carotid artery injury model. Proliferation and migration of human vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and endothelial cell (EC) were assessed by cell number and Boyden chamber, respectively. Endothelial senescence was evaluated by the β-galactosidase assay, endothelial dysfunction by organ chambers for isometric tension. Arterial thrombus formation was delayed in mice treated with PIK75 when compared with controls. PIK75 impaired arterial expression and activity of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1); in contrast, plasma clotting and platelet aggregation did not differ. In VSMC and EC, PIK75 inhibited expression and activity of TF and PAI-1. These effects occurred at the transcriptional level via the RhoA signalling cascade and the transcription factor NFkB. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K/p110α with PIK75 or a specific siRNA selectively impaired proliferation and migration of VSMC while sparing EC completely. Treatment with PIK75 did not induce endothelial senescence nor inhibit endothelium-dependent relaxations. In line with this observation, treatment with PIK75 selectively inhibited neointima formation without affecting re-endothelialization following vascular injury. CONCLUSION: Following vascular injury, PI3K/p110α inhibition selectively interferes with arterial thrombosis and neointima formation, but not re-endothelialization. Hence, PI3K/p110α represents an attractive new target in DES design.",2014,35,12,808-20,10.1093/eurheartj/eht496,#3538,Holy 2014,Endothelium

A nonclinical sample of 183 students provided severity ratings for (a) restlessness, (b) easily fatigued, (c) difficulty concentrating, (d) irritability, (e) muscle tension, and (f) sleep disturbance. In addition, they responded to questionnaires assessing pathological worry and depression symptoms. Partial correlations and multiple regression analyses indicated that only muscle tension showed a unique relation to pathological worry. In contrast, difficulty concentrating was exclusively related to depression symptoms. Present findings corroborate psychophysiological findings that elevated muscle tension is a specific characteristic of pathological worriers. Moreover, they suggest that the problem of unclear boundaries between GAD and major depression may be reduced if future revisions of the somatic symptom list for GAD emphasize muscle tension while de-emphasizing difficulty concentrating.",1999,13,5,491-503,10.1016/s0887-6185(99)00017-1,#3539,Joormann 1999,
855,27444755.0,Proliferation and Recruitment Contribute to Myocardial Macrophage Expansion in Chronic Heart Failure.,Circ Res,"RATIONALE: Macrophages reside in the healthy myocardium, participate in ischemic heart disease, and modulate myocardial infarction (MI) healing. Their origin and roles in post-MI remodeling of nonischemic remote myocardium, however, remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the number, origin, phenotype, and function of remote cardiac macrophages residing in the nonischemic myocardium in mice with chronic heart failure after coronary ligation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight weeks post MI, fate mapping and flow cytometry revealed that a 2.9-fold increase in remote macrophages results from both increased local macrophage proliferation and monocyte recruitment. Heart failure produced by extensive MI, through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, expanded medullary and extramedullary hematopoiesis. Circulating Ly6C(high) monocytes rose from 64±5 to 108±9 per microliter of blood (P<0.05). Cardiac monocyte recruitment declined in Ccr2(-/-) mice, reducing macrophage numbers in the failing myocardium. Mechanical strain of primary murine and human macrophage cultures promoted cell cycle entry, suggesting that the increased wall tension in post-MI heart failure stimulates local macrophage proliferation. Strained cells activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, whereas specific inhibitors of this pathway reduced macrophage proliferation in strained cell cultures and in the failing myocardium (P<0.05). Steady-state cardiac macrophages, monocyte-derived macrophages, and locally sourced macrophages isolated from failing myocardium expressed different genes in a pattern distinct from the M1/M2 macrophage polarization paradigm. In vivo silencing of endothelial cell adhesion molecules curbed post-MI monocyte recruitment to the remote myocardium and preserved ejection fraction (27.4±2.4 versus 19.1±2%; P<0.05).

No studies have compared the prevalence of abnormalities in singers on their subsequent follow-up SVL. Our study evaluates the frequency of these findings in both the initial and subsequent examinations. METHODS: Retrospective charts and SVL reports were reviewed on students from an opera conservatory from 1993 to 2014. All students had initial screening SVL, but only students who later returned with acute voice complaints were included in the study (n = 51, 137 follow-up visits). Normal SVL was defined as an examination without structural or functional abnormalities and reflux finding score ≤7. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: For initial examinations, 90.2% (including reflux) and 88.2% (excluding reflux) were abnormal. In follow-up examinations, 94.9% (including reflux) and 94.2% (excluding reflux) had abnormal findings, which included muscle tension dysphonia (40.1%), vocal fold (VF) masses (unilateral 48.9%, bilateral 30.7%), vascular abnormalities (unilateral 27.0%, bilateral 5.8%), sulcus (unilateral 17.5%, bilateral 5.1%), VF hypomobility (unilateral 36.3%, bilateral 5.9%), phase (30.6%) and amplitude (44.8%) asymmetries, and glottic insufficiency (49.3%). Follow-up examinations revealed a significant increase in laryngopharyngeal reflux (χ(2) = 7.043; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We found a higher prevalence of abnormal findings compared with previous studies, which we attributed to a more inclusive definition of abnormal pathologies, improvements in SVL technology, and possibly increased experience with SVL interpretation. This high prevalence of abnormal findings in asymptomatic singers further supports the importance of baseline examinations.",2016,30,4,472-7,10.1016/j.jvoice.2015.06.013,#3542,Myint 2016,Dysphonia

859,35168370.0,GSK-3β Localizes to the Cardiac Z-Disc to Maintain Length Dependent Activation.,Circ Res,"BACKGROUND: Altered kinase localization is gaining appreciation as a mechanism of cardiovascular disease. Previous work suggests GSK-3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) localizes to and regulates contractile function of the myofilament. We aimed to discover GSK-3β's in vivo role in regulating myofilament function, the mechanisms involved, and the translational relevance. METHODS: Inducible cardiomyocyte-specific GSK-3β knockout mice and left ventricular myocardium from nonfailing and failing human hearts were studied. RESULTS: Skinned cardiomyocytes from knockout mice failed to exhibit calcium sensitization with stretch indicating a loss of length-dependent activation (LDA), the mechanism underlying the Frank-Starling Law. Titin acts as a length sensor for LDA, and knockout mice had decreased titin stiffness compared with control mice, explaining the lack of LDA. Knockout mice exhibited no changes in titin isoforms, titin phosphorylation, or other thin filament phosphorylation sites known to affect passive tension or LDA. Mass spectrometry identified several z-disc proteins as myofilament phospho-substrates of GSK-3β. Agreeing with the localization of its targets, GSK-3β that is phosphorylated at Y216 binds to the z-disc. We showed pY216 was necessary and sufficient for z-disc binding using adenoviruses for wild-type, Y216F, and Y216E GSK-3β in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. One of GSK-3β's z-disc targets, abLIM-1 (actin-binding LIM protein 1), binds to the z-disc domains of titin that are important for maintaining passive tension. Genetic knockdown of abLIM-1 via siRNA in human engineered heart tissues resulted in enhancement of LDA, indicating abLIM-1 may act as a negative regulator that is modulated by GSK-3β. Last, GSK-3β myofilament localization was reduced in left ventricular myocardium from failing human hearts, which correlated with depressed LDA. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel mechanism by which GSK-3β localizes to the myofilament to modulate LDA. Importantly, z-disc GSK-3β levels were reduced in patients with heart failure, indicating z-disc localized GSK-3β is a possible therapeutic target to restore the Frank-Starling mechanism in patients with heart failure.",2022,130,6,871-886,10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.319491,#3544,Stachowski-Doll 2022,calcium
860,35721854.0,Biomechanical Properties of Paraspinal Muscles Influence Spinal Loading-A Musculoskeletal Simulation Study.,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,"Paraspinal muscles are vital to the functioning of the spine. Changes in muscle physiological cross-sectional area significantly affect spinal loading, but the importance of other muscle biomechanical properties remains unclear. This study explored the changes in spinal loading due to variation in five muscle biomechanical properties: passive stiffness, slack sarcomere length (SSL), in situ sarcomere length, specific tension, and pennation angle. An enhanced version of a musculoskeletal simulation model of the thoracolumbar spine with 210 muscle fascicles was used for this study and its predictions were validated for several tasks and multiple postures. Ranges of physiologically realistic values were selected for all five muscle parameters and their influence on L4-L5 intradiscal pressure (IDP) was investigated in standing and 36° flexion. We observed large changes in IDP due to changes in passive stiffness, SSL, in situ sarcomere length, and specific tension, often with interesting interplays between the parameters. For example, for upright standing, a change in stiffness value from one tenth to 10 times the baseline value increased the IDP only by 91% for the baseline model but by 945% when SSL was 0.4 μm shorter. Shorter SSL values and higher stiffnesses led to the largest increases in IDP. More changes were evident in flexion, as sarcomere lengths were longer in that posture and thus the passive curve is more influential. Our results highlight the importance of the muscle force-length curve and the parameters associated with it and motivate further experimental studies on in vivo measurement of those properties.",2022,10,,852201,10.3389/fbioe.2022.852201,#3545,Malakoutian 2022,biomechanics

This disease does not usually present with organic lesions, and voice analysis is crucial to evaluate it. METHODS: A retrospective study with 75 patients was performed. Correlation between grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia and strain scale and voice handicap index-10 was analysed. Any possible influence of the type of muscular tension dysphonia on these two scales was studied. RESULTS: There are only a few studies that correlate voice handicap index-10 and the grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia and strain scale; however, none of them are specific for patients suffering from muscular tension dysphonia. A moderate correlation (r = 0.56) was found. No influence of muscular tension dysphonia type on voice handicap index-10 score was found, but muscular tension dysphonia type 4 had worse grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia and strain scale scores than other muscular tension dysphonia types. This could be explained if muscular tension dysphonia type 4 is considered to be the most severe form of this disease.

862,22560323.0,Patient-specific finite element-based analysis of ventricular myofiber stress after Coapsys: importance of residual stress.,Ann Thorac Surg,"BACKGROUND: We sought to determine regional myofiber stress after Coapsys device (Myocor, Inc, Maple Grove, MN) implantation using a finite element model of the left ventricle (LV). Chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation is caused by LV remodeling after posterolateral myocardial infarction. The Coapsys device consists of a single trans-LV chord placed below the mitral valve such that when tensioned it alters LV shape and decreases chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation. METHODS: Finite element models of the LV were based on magnetic resonance images obtained before (preoperatively) and after (postoperatively) coronary artery bypass grafting with Coapsys implantation in a single patient. To determine the effect of Coapsys and LV before stress, virtual Coapsys was performed on the preoperative model. Diastolic and systolic material variables in the preoperative, postoperative, and virtual Coapsys models were adjusted so that model LV volume agreed with magnetic resonance imaging data. Chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation was abolished in the postoperative models. In each case, myofiber stress and pump function were calculated. RESULTS: Both postoperative and virtual Coapsys models shifted end-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships to the left. As a consequence and because chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation was reduced after Coapsys, pump function was unchanged. Coapsys decreased myofiber stress at end-diastole and end-systole in both the remote and infarct regions of the myocardium. However, knowledge of Coapsys and LV prestress was necessary for accurate calculation of LV myofiber stress, especially in the remote zone. CONCLUSIONS: Coapsys decreases myofiber stress at end-diastole and end-systole. The improvement in myofiber stress may contribute to the long-term effect of Coapsys on LV remodeling.",2012,93,6,1964-71,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.03.001,#3547,Carrick 2012,
863,28396220.0,Does Even Low-Grade Dysphonia Warrant Voice Center Referral?,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: Data regarding the referral of dysphonic patients to specialty voice clinics are limited. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between low perceptual dysphonia severity and subtle laryngeal findings to discern if this can help guide referral. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective chart review. METHODS: The charts of 94 patients presenting with a primary complaint of hoarseness to a single laryngologist over a 1-year period at a tertiary care, interdisciplinary voice center were analyzed. Patients were stratified by clinician perceptual rating of dysphonia severity using the overall Grade score from the GRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain) scale, and this was compared to their laryngeal findings on stroboscopy. RESULTS: Forty-one patients had a Grade score of 0 or 1, of whom 85% had relatively subtle findings on stroboscopy, including vocal fold paresis, muscle tension dysphonia, and spasmodic dysphonia. CONCLUSION: Patients with a primary complaint of hoarseness but absent or only mild perceptual dysphonia may have subtle or occult laryngeal findings that may be easily missed. These patients may benefit from early referral to a specialty voice center.",2017,31,6,753-756,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.03.011,#3548,Soni 2017,Dysphonia
864,465580.0,The effects of EMG feedback training during problem solving: a case study.,Biofeedback Self Regul,"The present case study investigated the effects of competing task demands on biofeedback training to reduce frontalis muscle tension. Baseline levels of frontalis muscle tension were recorded for relaxation and problem solving. The subject was trained to decrease muscle tension with biofeedback for the problem-solving task alone. The results indicated that EMG training during problem-solving was successfully accomplished. Frontalis muscle tension during relaxation baseline did not change as a result of reductions in muscle tension during problem-solving feedback training. This suggests that the decrease of muscle tension cannot be attributed to reductions in overall muscle tension levels. Instead, training was specific to the problem-solving feedback phases. Additionally, it was found that accuracy in problem-solving did not decline as a result of simultaneous feedback training. Thus EMG biofeedback training can be accomplished and exercised without disruption of ongoing mental activity.",1979,4,1,81-6,10.1007/BF00998951,#3549,Solomon 1979,
865,23419916.0,Do convolutions in Kinesio Taping matter? Comparison of two Kinesio Taping approaches in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain: protocol of a randomised trial.,J Physiother,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic low back pain is a common condition. A new intervention that is popular in sports has been used in patients with low back pain. This technique is based on the use of elastic tapes that are fixed on the skin of patients using different tensions and is named Kinesio Taping Method. Although this intervention has been widely used, to date the evidence of its effectiveness is lacking. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the application of the Kinesio Taping Method according to the treatment manual (with convolutions in neutral position) more efficacious than a simple application without convolutions in patients with chronic low back pain? DESIGN: Two-arm randomised controlled trial with a blinded assessor. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 148 patients with chronic low back pain from two outpatient physiotherapy clinics in Brazil. INTERVENTION: 8 sessions of Kinesio Taping according to the Kinesio Taping Method treatment manual (ie, 10-15% tension with the treated muscles in stretching position and with convolutions in neutral). CONTROL: 8 sessions of Kinesio Taping having no convolutions in neutral (0% tension) with the treated muscles in resting position. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical outcomes (pain intensity, disability and global impression of recovery) will be obtained in assessments that will be performed at 4 weeks and 3 months after randomisation. ANALYSIS: The effects of the intervention will be calculated through linear mixed models following intention-to-treat principles. DISCUSSION: This is the largest study aimed to investigate the hypothesised mechanism behind the Kinesio Taping application in patients with chronic low back pain. The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding about the mechanisms of action of this widely applied therapeutic modality.

866,3315151.0,"The evaluation of ""spasticity"".",Can J Neurol Sci,"Lesions of the upper motor neuron cause: 1. Alterations in segmental reflex activity. For example increased tendon jerks and velocity dependent stretch reflexes (""spasticity""), clonus, the clasp knife response, release of flexion reflexes and extensor plantar reflexes. 2. Impaired ability to activate motoneurons rapidly and selectively. Voluntary movements may also be restrained by co-contraction of antagonists muscles, by segmental reflexes (enhanced during voluntary effort) or by contractures. A combination of these factors may impair overall functional ability. Segmental reflexes, voluntary power and overall functional abilities can be assessed using clinical scoring systems. Recordings of muscle length, tension and EMG offer more objective measures of reflex and voluntary activity and of overall functions such as locomotion, and can separate weakness from co-contraction, spasticity from contracture. Methods are now available for exploring individual (transmitter specific) segmental reflex pathways and descending pathways in man. Lesions of the upper motor neuron are complicated by secondary changes in segmental neurons. Segmental reflex activity and muscle mechanics depend on the immediate past history of events. These factors must be taken into account.",1987,14,3 Suppl,497-500,10.1017/s0317167100037987,#3551,Ashby 1987,

Dopamine infusion at 10 mug/kg.min in the 10 patients increased cardiac output by 35%, left ventricular peak dP/dt by 38%, left ventricular minute work index by 44% and mean systolic ejection rate by 7% (P < 0.01); heart rate, aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and tension-time index were unchanged. For oxygen, potassium and lactate, arterial and coronary sinus values, coronary arteriovenous oxygen differences and myocardial extraction were unchanged. Hemodynamically 13 of the 17 patients in shock responded favourably to dopamine infusion (0.5 to 15 mug/kg.min), with decrease in heart rate, increase in systolic arterial pressure from 75 to 100 mm Hg (P <0.001), decrease in ventricular filling pressure from 20 to 16 mm Hg (P < 0.01) and increase in urine output from 10 to 100 ml/h (P < 0.01). Eleven of those patients survived the shock episode. A close relation was observed between the hemodynamic response to dopamine, survival from the shock episode and the time between onset of shock and initiation of therapy. Low rates of dopamine infusion induced diuresis in the three patients with severe cardiac failure.Dopamine thus seems to improve the mechanical efficiency of the heart in coronary artery disease. Cardiac output is selectively increased and myocardial ischemia does not appear to be induced; those beneficial effects as well as presumably specific action on renal flow and natriuresis, improve immediate survival from cardiogenic shock and severe heart failure.",1977,116,6,645-8,,#3552,ThÃ©roux 1977,
868,20222024.0,Differential diagnosis of muscle tension dysphonia and adductor spasmodic dysphonia using spectral moments of the long-term average spectrum.,Laryngoscope,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) can mimic the voice characteristics of muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) contributing to diagnostic confusion and inappropriate management. Elevated spectral noise has been reported in MTD, which may aid in differential diagnosis. The long-term average spectrum (LTAS) can be compared to a Gaussian bell curve using spectral moments analysis. Four moments describe features of the LTAS: spectral mean (moment 1), standard deviation (moment 2), skewness (moment 3), and kurtosis (moment 4). This investigation evaluated spectral moments analysis of the LTAS as an objective test to distinguish ADSD from MTD. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control comparison. METHODS: Pretreatment voice samples from 59 subjects with MTD (10 males and 49 females) and 41 subjects with ADSD (19 males and 22 females) were analyzed. Groups were separated by gender, adjusted for age, and results from the analysis were compared across different analyzing bandwidths. Diagnostic precision estimates were calculated including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios. RESULTS: No significant spectral differences were found between men in both groups. However, significant between-group differences were identified for all spectral moments for women. Logistic stepwise regression identified that spectral standard deviation (moment 2) uniquely distinguished women with MTD and ADSD. No other spectral moments contributed significant discriminatory information. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that moment 2 of the LTAS provides respectable diagnostic precision by highlighting spectral noise differences between females with MTD and ADSD. Automated spectral moments analysis deserves further attention as a possible test for differential diagnosis.",2010,120,4,749-57,10.1002/lary.20741,#3553,Houtz 2010,
869,28965662.0,Correlation of the Iranian Voice Quality of Life Profile (IVQLP) with Acoustic Measurements across Three Common Voice Disorders.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: The Iranian Voice Quality of Life Profile (IVQLP) is a recent culture-based developed tool for assessing the quality of life of dysphonic patients. The research questions addressed here are as follows: (1) Are the correlations between IVQLP scores and values of objective voice measures? (2) Do the correlations differ across the three different voice disorders? METHODS: The subjects were divided into three groups: muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) (n = 62), benign midmembranous vocal fold lesions (n = 56), and unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) (n = 32). The study sample consisted of 91 males and 59 females. The individuals had a mean age of 46.53 ± 13.84 years. All of the participants completed the IVQLP questionnaire. The PRAAT software was used to provide acoustic analyses. The correlations between fundamental frequency (F0), perturbation analyses, harmonics-to-noise ratio, and IVQLP data of the three groups of patients were measured using Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the total score and jitter in the MTD group. For the benign vocal fold lesion group, correlations were significant and relatively strong for numerous analyses. Again, there were numerous significant and strong correlations for the UVFP group. CONCLUSIONS: Results may indicate two interpretations. One interpretation of the results is that patients with morphological tissue changes (lesions, paralysis) appear to associate their sense of how their voice problem negatively affects their lives. A second interpretation is that there is perhaps a threshold of vocal perturbation or instability that lends itself to a patient's connection to his or her sense of how the voice affects his or her quality of life.",2018,32,4,514.e7-514.e11,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.07.010,#3554,Dehqan 2018,Acoustic measurements

If we were to attempt to use the results of these studies as the basis for a treatment plan, it would be necessary to investigate the presence (or absence) of a causal relationship between the two. However, upon examination of previous studies we consider that this causal relationship has in fact either not been proven or has been refuted. To this end, we have conducted this study based on the hypothesis that spinal imaging abnormality and low back and leg pain possess a spurious relationship wherein muscle tension is the lurking variable. Furthermore, we propose a five-phase hypothesis considering the generative sequence of and causal relationship between spinal imaging abnormality, low back and leg pain, and muscle tension. Specifically, Phase I represents the healthy condition; Phase II indicates the occurrence of muscle tension only; Phase III indicates the occurrence of pain resulting from muscle tension; Phase IV represents the occurrence of both pain and imaging abnormality as a result of muscle tension; and Phase V indicates residual imaging abnormality despite amelioration of muscle tension. We believe that this hypothesis has the potential to facilitate pathological understanding and resolve the current confusion surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of spinal disorders.",2009,73,5,698-702,10.1016/j.mehy.2009.05.006,#3555,Ishihara 2009,

Physical complaints are more commonly reported on the dominant upper extremity. This may be the consequence of challenging laparoscopic tasks being easier to perform with the dominant side. The authors hypothesized that specific training of the nondominant upper extremity may equip this side better and lead to a more equal distribution of physical load. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (medical doctors) were randomized to a 3-week training schedule or no training. The training program consisted of training the nondominant upper extremity. Participants were not allowed to train on a laparoscopic box or virtual reality trainer during the study period. Baseline and outcome measurements after 3 weeks were examined with the use of EMG measurements during a validated task on a laparoscopic box trainer. Muscle strain of the trapezius and deltoid muscles and effective alternation of brachioradial and abductor pollicis brevis muscles were used as outcome variables. RESULTS: In all, 26 participants were included. EMG analysis revealed that participants in both intervention and control groups showed a decrease in muscle strain of trapezius and deltoid muscles. However, there were no significant differences between groups. Those in the intervention group showed significantly better alternation in the brachioradial muscle. CONCLUSION: Training the nondominant upper extremity leads to better alternated use of lower-arm muscles during a validated box trainer task. Repeating the task after 3 weeks led to less muscle tension in the trapezius and deltoid muscles.",2013,20,3,292-8,10.1177/1553350612456099,#3558,Nieboer 2013,ergonomics

A range of typical exercises are therefore being used to strengthen weakened groups of muscles, some of them traditionally already included in school sports. Most therapy concepts primarily focus on muscle strengthening, without taking into consideration that it is crucial to redress muscular imbalances by stretching contracted muscle groups as well. Based on this experience, the effectiveness of several specifically modified exercises was tested, derived from the usual range of physiotherapy activities in strengthening very commonly weakened muscle groups, i.e. the abdominal, gluteal, sacrospinalis and shoulder-blade affixing musculature. To increase exercise effectiveness, training machines were used in addition. Stretching exercises were carried out initially, in terms of passive stretching with isometric pre-tension. The following muscle groups were stretched: rectus femoris m., iliopsoas m., pectoralis m., and lumbar sacrospinalis m. Altogether, 64 patients between age 16 and 27 were examined following training therapy, 58 patients presented pure postural disorders, 6 had slight cerebral movement disorders. Two almost equal study groups were formed, one (31 patients) receiving only gymnastic exercises, the other (33 patients) using training machines. The muscular situation was tested after 6 months by means of Janda's semiquantitative muscle-testing. For further objective assessment of therapy outcome, Neugebauer's 'back-index' was determined. Muscular harmony and spinal balance were found to have significantly improved in the second group who had used the training machines.

878,19300250.0,Chronic tension-type headache: what is new?,Curr Opin Neurol,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses current data on nosological boundaries related to diagnosis, pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnostic criteria of CTTH should be adapted to improve its sensitivity against migraine. It seems that mechanical pain sensitivity is a consequence and not a causative factor of CTTH. Recent evidence is modifying previous knowledge about relationships between muscle tissues and CTTH, suggesting a potential role of muscle trigger points in the genesis of pain. An updated pain model suggests that headache perception can be explained by referred pain from trigger points in the craniocervical muscles, mediated through the spinal cord and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis rather than only tenderness of the muscles themselves. Different therapeutic strategies, pharmacological, physical therapy, psychological and acupuncture, are generally used. The therapeutic efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs remains incomplete. The tricyclic antidepressants are the most used first-line therapeutic agents for CTTH. Surprisingly, few controlled studies have been performed and not all of them have found an efficacy superior to placebo. Further, there is insufficient evidence to support/refute the efficacy of physical therapy in CTTH.

880,18667758.0,Totally implantable robot to treat chronic atrial fibrillation.,Bioinspir Biomim,"Chronic atrial fibrillation affects millions of people worldwide. Its surgical treatment often fails to restore the transport function of the atrium. This study first introduces the concept of an atrial assist device (AAD) to restore the pump function of the atrium. The AAD is developed to be totally implantable in the human body with a transcutaneous energy transfer system to recharge the implanted battery. The ADD consists of a motorless pump based on artificial muscle technology, positioned on the external surface of the atrium to compress it and restore its muscular activity. A bench model reproduces the function of a fibrillating atrium to assess the circulatory support that this pump can provide. Atripump (Nanopowers SA, Switzerland) is a dome-shaped silicone-coated nitinol actuator 5 mm high, sutured on the external surface of the atrium. A pacemaker-like control unit drives the actuator that compresses the atrium, providing the mechanical support to the blood circulation. Electrical characteristics: the system is composed of one actuator that needs a minimal tension of 15 V and has a maximum current of 1.5 A with a 50% duty cycle. The implantable rechargeable battery is made of a cell having the following specifications: nominal tension of a cell: 4.1 V, tension after 90% of discharge: 3.5 V, nominal capacity of a cell: 163 mA h. The bench model consists of an open circuit made of latex bladder 60 mm in diameter filled with water. The bladder is connected to a vertically positioned tube that is filled to different levels, reproducing changes in cardiac preload. The Atripump is placed on the outer surface of the bladder. Pressure, volume and temperature changes were recorded. The contraction rate was 1 Hz with a power supply of 12 V, 400 mA for 200 ms. Preload ranged from 15 to 21 cm H(2)O. Maximal silicone membrane temperature was 55 degrees C and maximal temperature of the liquid environment was 35 degrees C. The pump produced a maximal work of 16 x 10(-3) J. Maximal volume pumped was 492 ml min(-1). This artificial muscle pump is compact, follows the Starling law and reproduces the hemodynamic performances of a normal atrium. It could represent a new tool to restore the atrial kick in persistent atrial fibrillation.",2008,3,3,35009,10.1088/1748-3182/3/3/035009,#3565,Tozzi 2008,

Voice problems in singers are not uncommon. The objective was to report the nature of voice problems and apply a routine protocol to assess the voice. METHODS: Forty-five trained performing singers (females: 36 and males: 9) who reported to a tertiary care hospital with voice problems underwent voice assessment. The study analyzed their problems and the clinical findings. RESULTS: Voice change, difficulty in singing higher pitches, and voice fatigue were major complaints. Most of the singers suffered laryngopharyngeal reflux that coexisted with muscle tension dysphonia and chronic laryngitis. Speaking voices were rated predominantly as ""moderate deviation"" on GRBAS (Grade, Rough, Breathy, Asthenia, and Strain). Maximum phonation time ranged from 4 to 29 seconds (females: 10.2, standard deviation [SD]: 5.28 and males: 15.7, SD: 5.79). Singing frequency range was reduced (females: 21.3 Semitones and males: 23.99 Semitones). Dysphonia severity index (DSI) scores ranged from -3.5 to 4.91 (females: 0.075 and males: 0.64). Singing frequency range and DSI did not show significant difference between sex and across clinical diagnosis. Self-perception using voice disorder outcome profile revealed overall severity score of 5.1 (SD: 2.7). Findings are discussed from a clinical intervention perspective. CONCLUSIONS: Study highlighted the nature of voice problems (hyperfunctional) and required modifications in assessment protocol for Carnatic singers. Need for regular assessments and vocal hygiene education to maintain good vocal health are emphasized as outcomes.",2014,28,1,128.e1-128.e9,10.1016/j.jvoice.2013.08.003,#3566,Arunachalam 2014,Carnatic singing
882,25133987.0,Seeking proxies for internal states in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,J Abnorm Psychol,"Pervasive doubts are a central feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We have theorized that obsessive doubts can arise in relation to any internal state and lead to compensatory reliance on more discernible substitutes (proxies), including rules and rituals. Previous findings corroborated this hypothesis, but were based on students with high and low OCD tendencies and did not control for anxiety. The present study tested our hypothesis in OCD participants using both anxiety disorders and nonclinical controls. Twenty OCD participants, 20 anxiety disorders participants, and 20 nonclinical participants underwent 2 experimental procedures. In the first, participants had to produce specific levels of muscle tension with and without the aid of biofeedback. In the second, participants were asked to subjectively assess their own muscle tension after viewing preprogrammed false feedback showing either increasing or decreasing levels of muscle tension. As predicted, OCD participants were less accurate than anxiety disorder and nonclinical participants in producing designated levels of muscle tension when biofeedback was not available and more likely to request the biofeedback when given the opportunity to do so. In the false feedback procedure, OCD participants were more influenced by the false biofeedback when judging their own level of muscle tension compared with the 2 controls groups. In both procedures, anxiety disorder participants did not differ from the nonclinical controls.

For that purpose, a finite element model specific for a 29-year-old subject was designed. Once the proposed numerical model was validated, the decrease in accommodative amplitude with age was simulated according to data available in the literature. METHODS: In contrast with previous studies, the non-accommodated eye condition was the reference configuration. Consequently, two aspects were specifically highlighted: contraction of the ciliary muscle, which was simulated by a continuum electro-mechanical model and incorporation of initial lens capsule stresses, which allowed the lens to become accommodated after releasing the resting zonular tension. RESULTS: The morphological changes and contraction of the ciliary muscle were calibrated accurately according to the experimental data from the literature. All dynamic optical and biometric lens measurements validated the model. With the proposed numerical model, presbyopia was successfully simulated. CONCLUSIONS: The most widespread theory of accommodation, proposed by Helmholtz, was simulated accurately. Assuming the same initial stresses in the lens capsule over time, stiffening of the lens nucleus is the main cause of presbyopia.",2021,41,6,1241-1253,10.1111/opo.12876,#3568,Cabeza-Gil 2021,accommodative change

METHODS: Chronic tension headache sufferers received structured massage therapy treatment directed toward neck and shoulder muscles. Headache frequency, duration, and intensity were recorded and compared with baseline measures. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, headache frequency was significantly reduced within the first week of the massage protocol. The reduction of headache frequency continued for the remainder of the study (P =.009). The duration of headaches tended to decrease during the massage treatment period (P =.058). Headache intensity was unaffected by massage (P =.19). CONCLUSIONS: The muscle-specific massage therapy technique used in this study has the potential to be a functional, nonpharmacological intervention for reducing the incidence of chronic tension headache.",2002,92,10,1657-61,10.2105/ajph.92.10.1657,#3569,Quinn 2002,
885,30348455.0,Kinesio Taping reduces pain and improves disability in low back pain patients: a randomised controlled trial.,Physiotherapy,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Kinesio Taping(®) (KT) on chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP). DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis. SETTING: University laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and eight women with chronic non-specific LBP underwent an evaluation pre, 3 and 10 days after intervention. INTERVENTIONS: After randomisation, participants were assigned to four groups: KT with tension group (KTT) applied KT(®) with tension in the region of the erector spinae muscles; KT no tension group (KTNT) applied KT(®) with no tension in the same region; Micropore group (MP) applied Micropore(®) tape on the erector spinae muscles; and control group (CG) did not receive any intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was pain sensation, measured by numerical pain rating scale. Secondary outcomes were: disability (Roland Morris Disability questionnaire), trunk range of motion (inclinometry), strength (dynamometry) and electromyographic amplitude (electromyography). RESULTS: Improved pain relief was observed for KTT group (mean difference 2.0; 95% CI 0.5 to 3.4; P=0.003) and KTNT group [mean difference (MD) 1.9; 95% CI 0.5 to 3.4; P=0.004] compared with CG at 3days after application of the tape. For disability, there was a difference between CG and KTT group at 3days (MD 3.5; 95% CI 0.8 to 6.1; P=0.004) and 10days (MD 32; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.0; P=0.016). For all the other variables, there were no differences between groups. CONCLUSION: KT with or without tension reduces pain 3days after its application. Additionally, when applied with tension, it improves disability after 3 and 10days in patients with LBP.

886,14723558.0,Myofascial pain disorders: theory to therapy.,Drugs,"Voluntary muscle is the largest human organ system. The musculotendinous contractual unit sustains posture against gravity and actuates movement against inertia. Muscular injury can occur when soft tissues are exposed to single or recurrent episodes of biomechanical overloading. Muscular pain is often attributed to a myofascial pain disorder, a condition originally described by Drs Janet Travell and David Simons. Among patients seeking treatment from a variety of medical specialists, myofascial pain has been reported to vary from 30% to 93% depending on the subspecialty practice and setting. Forty-four million Americans are estimated to have myofascial pain; however, controversy exists between medical specialists regarding the diagnostic criteria for myofascial pain disorders and their existence as a pathological entity. Muscles with activity or injury-related pain are usually abnormally shortened with increased tone and tension. In addition, myofascial pain disorders are characterised by the presence of tender, firm nodules called trigger points. Within each trigger point is a hyperirritable spot, the 'taut-band', which is composed of hypercontracted extrafusal muscle fibres. Palpation of this spot within the trigger point provokes radiating, aching-type pain into localised reference zones. Research suggests that myofascial pain and dysfunction with characteristic trigger points and taut-bands are a spinal reflex disorder caused by a reverberating circuit of sustained neural activity in a specific spinal cord segment. The treatment of myofascial pain disorders requires that symptomatic trigger points and muscles are identified as primary or ancillary pain generators. Mechanical, thermal and chemical treatments, which neurophysiologically or physically denervate the neural loop of the trigger point, can result in reduced pain and temporary resolution of muscular overcontraction. Most experts believe that appropriate treatment should be directed at the trigger point to restore normal muscle length and proper biomechanical orientation of myofascial elements, followed by treatment that includes strengthening and stretching of the affected muscle. Chronic myofascial pain is usually a product of both physical and psychosocial influences that complicate convalescence.",2004,64,1,45-62,10.2165/00003495-200464010-00004,#3571,Wheeler 2004,
887,27261979.0,Effects of progressive muscle relaxation on cerebral activity: An fMRI investigation.,Complement Ther Med,"OBJECTIVES: Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is one of the self-management relaxation techniques that can be used in the general population and patients with specific issues. However, no study to date has revealed the brain activity associated with PMR. Therefore, we assessed the changes in brain activity induced by PMR using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted an intervention study with PMR and control sessions. The subjects were twelve healthy adult men who had no prior experience of PMR. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects performed a control session in which muscles were repeatedly simply tensed and relaxed. Subsequently, a PMR session took place, during which muscle tension was reduced through a systematic procedure of tensing and relaxing of muscle groups combined with structured breathing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We identified and visualised brain activity based on individual and group-level analysis of fMRI data. RESULTS: Eleven subjects' data were analysed. In the control session, brain activity broadly changed, while the change was limited to specific parts of the cerebral cortex and limbic system in the PMR session. PMR gradually decreased activity in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In a region of interest (ROI) analysis, interactions between sessions were observed in the putamen, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), postcentral gyrus (PCG), and insula. CONCLUSIONS: That PMR led to few areas showing changed activity suggests that the technique may suppress brain activity. Even novices may be able to induce such a focused mental state.",2016,26,,33-9,10.1016/j.ctim.2016.02.010,#3572,Kobayashi 2016,Brain activity

A high construction bite, approximately 8 to 10 mm between upper and lower incisor edges was employed. By increasing the vertical separation of the construction bite to a specific range, the high construction bite intensified the activation of the myotatic reflex in the muscles of mastication as well the passive tension in the stretched perioral muscles through the viscoelastic properties. (Furthermore, the tension which was generated passively from the stretched perioral soft tissues, such as tendon and skin, would join the force). In these two cases, we could efficiently use the active and passive tension of the muscles by using an activator of this type, and gain the effective orthodontic force clinically.",1989,48,1,66-78,,#3573,Masunaga 1989,

All 56 subjects reported being conditioned in the course of the nine 1/2-hour training sessions. Detailed records of perceived severity and duration of the headaches were maintained by the subjects before the study and for at least 3 months after the training period. While even a conservative F revealed a diminution of perceived severity, of hours/month of headache, and of an index conceived by Budzynski, Stoyva, Adler, and Mullaney (1973), across time, at beyond the .05 level of significance, no specific treatment emerged as clearly most effective for either type of headache.

890,10070500.0,Alterations of cross-bridge kinetics in human atrial and ventricular myocardium.,Cardiovasc Res,"CONDENSED ABSTRACT: We analyzed actomyosin cross-bridge kinetics in human atrial and ventricular muscle strip preparations by using sinusoidal length changes from 0.1 to 60 Hz. The minimum stiffness frequency was higher in atrial than in ventricular human myocardium and lower in failing than in non-failing left ventricular human myocardium. beta-Adrenergic stimulation increased the minimum stiffness frequency by 18 +/- 3% (p < 0.05). Cross-bridge kinetics are temperature-dependent, with a Q10 of at least 2.7. BACKGROUND: Dynamic stiffness measurements have revealed acute and chronic alterations of actomyosin cross-bridge kinetics in cardiac muscles of a variety of different animal species. We studied dynamic stiffness in right atrial and left ventricular preparations of non-failing and failing human hearts and tested the influence of the temperature and beta-adrenergic stimulation on cross-bridge kinetics. METHODS AND RESULTS: Muscle strips were prepared from right atria and left ventricles from human non-failing and failing hearts. After withdrawal of calcium, steady contracture tension was induced by the addition of 1.5 mM barium chloride. Sinusoidal length oscillations of 1% muscle length were applied, with a frequency spectrum of between 0.1 and 60 Hz. Dynamic stiffness was calculated from the length change and the corresponding force response amplitude. The specific minimum stiffness frequency, which indicates the interaction between cross-bridge recruitment and cross-bridge cycling dynamics, was analyzed for each condition: (1) The minimum stiffness frequency was 0.78 +/- 0.04 Hz in left ventricular myocardium and 2.80 +/- 0.31 Hz in right atrial myocardium (p < 0.01) at 27 degrees C. (2) The minimum stiffness frequency was 41% higher in non-failing compared to failing left ventricular human myocardium. (3) Over a wide range of experimental temperatures, the minimum stiffness frequency changed, with a Q10 of at least 2.7. (4) beta-Adrenergic stimulation significantly (p < 0.05) increased the minimum stiffness to 18 +/- 3% higher frequencies and significantly (p < 0.05) lowered contracture tension by 7 +/- 1%. CONCLUSIONS: The contractility of human heart muscle is not only regulated by excitation-contraction coupling but also by modulation of intrinsic properties of the actomyosin system. Acute and chronic alterations of cross-bridge kinetics have been demonstrated, which play a significant role in the physiology and pathophysiology of the human heart.",1998,40,3,580-90,10.1016/s0008-6363(98)00164-3,#3575,Ruf 1998,
891,8852309.0,The function of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament: its implication for understanding low back pain.,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),"STUDY DESIGN: In embalmed human bodies the tension of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament was measured during incremental loading of anatomical structures that are biomechanically relevant. OBJECTIVES: To assess the function of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In many patients with aspecific low back pain or peripartum pelvic pain, pain is experienced in the region in which the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament is located. It is not well known that the ligament can be easily palpated in the area directly caudal to the posterior superior iliac spine. Data on the functional and clinical importance of this ligament are lacking. METHODS: A dissection study was performed on the sacral and lumbar regions. The tension of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament (n = 12) was tested under loading. Tension was measured with a buckle transducer. Several structures, including the erector spinae muscle, the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia, the sarcotuberous ligament, and the sacrum, were incrementally loaded (with forces of 0-50 newtons). The sacrum was loaded in two directions, causing nutation (ventral rotation of the sacrum relative to the iliac bones) and counternutation (the reverse). RESULTS: Forced nutation in the sacroiliac joints diminished the tension and forced counternutation increased the tension. Tension in the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament increased during loading of the ipsilateral sacrotuberous ligament and erector spinae muscle. The tension decreased during traction to the gluteus maximus muscle. Tension also decreased during traction to the ipsilateral and contralateral posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia in a direction simulating contraction of the latissimus dorsi muscle. CONCLUSIONS: The long dorsal sacroiliac ligament has close anatomical relations with the erector spinae muscle, the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia, and a specific part of the sacrotuberous ligament (tuberoiliac ligament). Functionally, it is an important link between legs, spine, and arms. The ligament is tensed when the sacroiliac joints are counternutated and slackened when nutated. The reverse holds for the sacrotuberous ligament. Slackening of the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament can be counterbalanced by both the sacrotuberous ligament and the erector muscle. Pain localized within the boundaries of the long ligament could indicate among other things a spinal condition with sustained counternutation of the sacroiliac joints. In diagnosing patients with aspecific low back pain or peripartum pelvic pain, the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament should not be neglected. Even in cases of arthrodesis of the sacroiliac joints, tension in the long ligament can still be altered by different structures.",1996,21,5,556-62,10.1097/00007632-199603010-00005,#3576,Vleeming 1996,
892,3729704.0,Effects of pelvic muscle tension and expectancy on general and specific indicators of sexual arousal.,Arch Sex Behav,"One group of 20 males was told that tensing the pelvic musculature would enhance sexual responsiveness (tension-good), while another group of 20 males was told that relaxation would increase responsiveness (relaxation-good). Using feedback to regulate EMG to predetermined levels, subjects were required in a counterbalanced design to tense and relax while viewing one of two matched series of 14 erotic slides interspersed with neutral slides. Expectancy and induced tension or relaxation both affected penile response: Relaxation was accompanied by lower levels of penile volume response to slides than was tension but only in the relaxation-good group. A similar pattern of means was shown in scores on a general arousal factor with virtually equal contributions from respiration rate, respiration amplitude, and heart rate. These data are interpreted to show that tension enhanced responsiveness irrespective of induced expectancy but that the effect of relaxation depended upon whether subjects were (correctly) informed that tension was conducive to greater response. Over subjects and conditions, penile volume was poorly correlated with the other physiological measures.",1986,15,3,247-60,10.1007/BF01542416,#3577,Oswald 1986,
893,11415595.0,Development and evaluation of a scalable and deformable geometric model of the human torso.,"Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)","A model is developed to provide a geometric representation of the human spine including thoracic and lumbar motion segments, lumbar muscles, ribs, sternum, sacrum, and pelvis. An existing model was modified in order to allow for scaling using standard anthropometric measures, deformation to specific 3-dimensional postures using surface markers, and incorporation of muscle length-tension and motion segment passive bending properties. Experiments were performed to evaluate the accuracy of model postural predictions. Analysis of surface marker displacements demonstrated that the thoracic spine deforms only minimally over a range of flexion, extension, and lateral bending torso postures, suggesting that it can be treated as essentially rigid during low-weight lifting over the range of passive flexibility. Locations of bony landmarks were accurately reproduced (mean errors 2.9-6.8 mm) as were several body dimensions (mean differences 2.6-15.4 mm). It is concluded that linear scaling to subject-specific anthropometry and the use of specific surface markers provides an accurate and direct technique for describing spinal geometry. Predicted passive spinal moments were found to be comparable to those required to support body weight in different extreme postures. It is recommended that data obtained from this type of model be incorporated in future investigations of spinal loading.",1996,11,1,25-34,10.1016/0268-0033(95)00031-3,#3578,Nussbaum 1996,
894,17644689.0,Adaptational responses of the human Achilles tendon by modulation of the applied cyclic strain magnitude.,J Exp Biol,"Tendons are able to remodel their mechanical and morphological properties in response to mechanical loading. However, there is little information about the effects of controlled modulation in cyclic strain magnitude applied to the tendon on the adaptation of tendon's properties in vivo. The present study investigated whether the magnitude of the mechanical load induced as cyclic strain applied to the Achilles tendon may have a threshold in order to trigger adaptation effects on tendon mechanical and morphological properties. Twenty-one adults (experimental group, N=11; control group, N=10) participated in the study. The participants of the experimental group exercised one leg at low-magnitude tendon strain (2.85+/-0.99%) and the other leg at high-magnitude tendon strain (4.55+/-1.38%) of similar frequency and volume. After 14 weeks of exercise intervention we found a decrease in strain at a given tendon force, an increase in tendon-aponeurosis stiffness and tendon elastic modulus and a region-specific hypertrophy of the Achilles tendon only in the leg exercised at high strain magnitude. These findings provide evidence of the existence of a threshold or set-point at the applied strain magnitude at which the transduction of the mechanical stimulus may influence the tensional homeostasis of the tendons. The results further show that the mechanical load exerted on the Achilles tendon during the low-strain-magnitude exercise is not a sufficient stimulus for triggering further adaptation effects on the Achilles tendon than the stimulus provided by the mechanical load applied during daily activities.",2007,210,Pt 15,2743-53,10.1242/jeb.003814,#3579,Arampatzis 2007,
895,30517907.0,Muscular tension significantly affects stability in standing posture.,Gait Posture,"BACKGROUND: Muscular co-contraction is a strategy commonly used by elders with the aim to increase stability. However, co-contraction leads to stiffness which in turns reduces stability. Some literature seems to suggest an opposite approach and to point out relaxation as a way to improve stability. Teaching relaxation is therefore becoming the aim of many studies letting unclear whether tension or relaxation are the most effective muscular strategy to improve stability. Relaxation is a misleading concept in our society. It is often confused with rest, while it should be addressed during stressing tasks, where it should aim to reduce energetic costs and increase stability. The inability to relax can be related to sub-optimal neuro-motor control, which can lead to increased stresses. RESEARCH QUESTION: The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of voluntary muscle contraction and relaxation over the stability of human standing posture, answering two specific research questions: (1) Does the muscular tension have an impact on stability of standing posture? (2) Could this impact be estimated by using a minimally invasive procedure? METHODS: By using a force plate, we analysed the displacement of the center of pressure of 30 volunteers during state of tension and relaxation in comparison with a control state, and with open and closed eyes. RESULTS: We found that tension significantly reduced the stability of subjects (15 out of 16 parameters, p < 0.003). SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that daily situations of stress can lead to decreased stability. Such a loss might actually increase the risk of chronic joint overload or fall. Finally, breathing has direct effect over the management of pain and stress, and the results reported here point out the need to explicitly explore the troubling fact that a large portion of population might not be able to properly breath.",2019,68,,220-226,10.1016/j.gaitpost.2018.11.034,#3580,Tassani 2019,Muscular relaxation
896,36135945.0,Thermography in complementary assessments of head and neck muscles: A scoping review.,J Oral Rehabil,"INTRODUCTION: Infrared thermography has the potential to help assess human head and neck muscles, as thermal variation measurements due to muscle imbalance can contribute to the evaluation and therapeutic follow-up of various clinical conditions in the field of health. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated, with a scoping review, the use of infrared thermography in complementary assessments of human head and neck muscles to determine the extent of research on the topic, what methodologies are used in thermal assessment and thermographic analysis, what regions are assessed, and what results are expected in thermography. METHODS: LILACS, MEDLINE, SciELO, and Web of Science were the databases searched to identify articles published on the topic, with no restriction of language or time of publication. Descriptive, analytical, and experimental observational studies on the assessment of the human head and neck muscle surface temperature with infrared thermography were included. Case studies, case series, methodological accuracy, literature review, animal studies, studies that assessed patients with head and neck cancer, and studies that did not assess head and neck muscle temperature with thermography were excluded. The articles were analysed with a protocol developed by the authors, with data on author, year, country, type of study, sample characterisation, muscles assessed, outcomes investigated, thermal assessment methodology, thermographic analysis methodology and thermography measurements. RESULTS: This review identified and analysed 27 articles. The studies assessed thermal distribution in normal individuals and those with pathologies related to hyper- and hypofunctional head and neck muscle conditions for diagnosis or therapeutic follow-up. The masseter, temporal, digastric, anterior cervical region, orbicularis oris, frontalis, buccinator, suprahyoid, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and levator scapulae muscles were assessed. Quantitative analyses with area selection tool predominated, considering absolute temperatures and temperature differences. The studies investigated temperature and its relationship with myogenic pain, quantitative assessment of muscle parameters and blood flow velocity. The mean temperature ranged from 32.97°C (±2.21) to 34.90°C, and hyper-radiant and/or asymmetric regions were observed in hyperfunctional conditions and normal subjects after muscle activation. CONCLUSION: Thermography is used in complementary assessments of head and neck muscles, identifying hyper-radiant regions and thermal asymmetry related to muscle tension and activation state. Papers are limited to specific clinical conditions and few muscle groups, besides having great methodological variability.",2022,,,,10.1111/joor.13374,#3581,deAlmeidaANS 2022,facial muscles
897,29273230.0,Exploring the Neural Bases of Primary Muscle Tension Dysphonia: A Case Study Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,J Voice,"Primary muscle tension dysphonia (pMTD) is a voice disorder that occurs in the absence of laryngeal pathology. Dysregulated activity of the paralaryngeal muscles is considered the proximal cause; however, the central origin of this aberrant laryngeal muscle activation is unclear. The Trait Theory (Roy and Bless, 2000a,b) proposed that specific personality traits can predispose one to laryngeal motor inhibition and pMTD, and this inhibition is mediated by a hyperactive ""behavioral inhibition system (BIS)"" composed of limbic system structures (and associated prefrontal connections). This case study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to detect brain activation changes associated with successful management of pMTD, thereby evaluating possible neural correlates of this poorly understood disorder. METHOD: A 61-year-old woman with moderate-to-severe pMTD underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans before and immediately after successful treatment using manual circumlaryngeal techniques. Experimental stimuli were blocks of repeated vowel production and overt sentence reading. RESULTS: Significantly greater activation was observed pre- versus posttreatment in all regions of interest during sentence production, that is, periaqueductal gray, amygdala, hypothalamus, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Brodmann area 10, and premotor and inferior sensorimotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are compatible with overactivation of neural regions associated with the BIS (cingulate cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray) and motor inhibition networks (eg, [pre-]supplementary motor area) along with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Heightened input from limbic regions combined with dysfunctional prefrontal regulation may interfere with laryngeal motor preparation, initiation, and execution thereby contributing to disordered voice in pMTD.",2019,33,2,183-194,10.1016/j.jvoice.2017.11.009,#3582,Roy 2019,Behavioral inhibition system
898,22806632.0,Low myocardial protein kinase G activity in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.,Circulation,"BACKGROUND: Prominent features of myocardial remodeling in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) are high cardiomyocyte resting tension (F(passive)) and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In experimental models, both reacted favorably to raised protein kinase G (PKG) activity. The present study assessed myocardial PKG activity, its downstream effects on cardiomyocyte F(passive) and cardiomyocyte diameter, and its upstream control by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), nitrosative/oxidative stress, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). To discern altered control of myocardial remodeling by PKG, HFPEF was compared with aortic stenosis and HF with reduced EF (HFREF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HFPEF (n=36), AS (n=67), and HFREF (n=43) were free of coronary artery disease. More HFPEF patients were obese (P<0.05) or had diabetes mellitus (P<0.05). Left ventricular myocardial biopsies were procured transvascularly in HFPEF and HFREF and perioperatively in aortic stenosis. F(passive) was measured in cardiomyocytes before and after PKG administration. Myocardial homogenates were used for assessment of PKG activity, cGMP concentration, proBNP-108 expression, and nitrotyrosine expression, a measure of nitrosative/oxidative stress. Additional quantitative immunohistochemical analysis was performed for PKG activity and nitrotyrosine expression. Lower PKG activity in HFPEF than in aortic stenosis (P<0.01) or HFREF (P<0.001) was associated with higher cardiomyocyte F(passive) (P<0.001) and related to lower cGMP concentration (P<0.001) and higher nitrosative/oxidative stress (P<0.05). Higher F(passive) in HFPEF was corrected by in vitro PKG administration. CONCLUSIONS: Low myocardial PKG activity in HFPEF was associated with raised cardiomyocyte F(passive) and was related to increased myocardial nitrosative/oxidative stress. The latter was probably induced by the high prevalence in HFPEF of metabolic comorbidities. Correction of myocardial PKG activity could be a target for specific HFPEF treatment.",2012,126,7,830-9,10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.076075,#3583,vanHeerebeek 2012,
899,31442361.0,Extended hypoxia-mediated H(2) S production provides for long-term oxygen sensing.,Acta Physiol (Oxf),"AIM: Numerous studies have shown that H(2) S serves as an acute oxygen sensor in a variety of cells. We hypothesize that H(2) S also serves in extended oxygen sensing. METHODS: Here, we compare the effects of extended exposure (24-48 hours) to varying O(2) tensions on H(2) S and polysulphide metabolism in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293), human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial (A549), human colon cancer (HTC116), bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle, human umbilical-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells and porcine tracheal epithelium (PTE) using sulphur-specific fluorophores and fluorometry or confocal microscopy. RESULTS: All cells continuously produced H(2) S in 21% O(2) and H(2) S production was increased at lower O(2) tensions. Decreasing O(2) from 21% to 10%, 5% and 1% O(2) progressively increased H(2) S production in HEK293 cells and this was partially inhibited by a combination of inhibitors of H(2) S biosynthesis, aminooxyacetate, propargyl glycine and compound 3. Mitochondria appeared to be the source of much of this increase in HEK 293 cells. H(2) S production in all other cells and PTE increased when O(2) was lowered from 21% to 5% except for HTC116 cells where 1% O(2) was necessary to increase H(2) S, presumably reflecting the hypoxic environment in vivo. Polysulphides (H(2) S(n) , where n = 2-7), the key signalling metabolite of H(2) S also appeared to increase in many cells although this was often masked by high endogenous polysulphide concentrations. CONCLUSION: These results show that cellular H(2) S is increased during extended hypoxia and they suggest this is a continuously active O(2) -sensing mechanism in a variety of cells.",2020,228,3,e13368,10.1111/apha.13368,#3584,Olson 2020,hypoxia
900,3069680.0,[Tension headache--a review].,Fortschr Neurol Psychiatr,"Tension headache (TH) is an ill-defined headache syndrome, characterized by bilateral, daily headaches with fronto-occipital localisation. TH is often accompanied by a migraine and an abuse of analgesics and/or ergotamine. In the etiology of TH vascular, muscular and psychogenic factors are assumed. Floating transitions to common migraine are discussed. The increased muscle tension is not specific for TH, but more probably a consequence of TH. In addition a decrease of the pain threshold with a deficiency of the antinociceptive system is supposed. The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressives in TH is based on potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms and - besides their analgetic potencies - upon an increase of the pain threshold.

901,20861856.0,Role of kindlin-2 in fibroblast functions: implications for wound healing.,J Invest Dermatol,"Kindlins are a protein family that regulates cell-matrix interactions. Although kindlin-2 is known to be essential for the early developmental processes, its role in the homeostasis of adult tissues has remained elusive. In this study, we used new domain-specific antibodies and small interfering RNA technology to uncover physiological functions of kindlin-2 in human dermal fibroblasts in vitro and in adult skin in situ. In primary dermal fibroblasts, kindlin-2 is essential for the integrin clustering and activation, and it regulates cell adhesion and directed migration by guiding formation and maturation of focal adhesions (FAs) and organization of the cytoskeleton. These functions are linked to the transmission of mechanical cues between cells and their microenvironment, typically in processes wherein fibroblasts differentiate to myofibroblasts under mechanical tension. In concert, kindlin-2 was shown to be required for the stabilization and maturation of FAs and stress fibers in activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. These findings implicated that in physiological wound closure and tissue repair, the prediction was validated by strong upregulation of kindlin-2 in contractile myofibroblasts during middle stages of wound healing in human skin. Taken together, the data reveal a physiological role for kindlin-2 in skin fibroblasts under normal steady-state conditions and during tissue regeneration.",2011,131,1,245-56,10.1038/jid.2010.273,#3586,He 2011,

EMG level was found to be associated with both headache-specific and more global symptoms following biofeedback training. However, the level of pretreatment relationship between EMG level and headache symptoms was weak, and the amount of reduction in EMG activity over the course of biofeedback did not explain improvement. In addition, although the voluntary control over muscle spasming evidence by lowered EMG readings appeared to enhance patients' post-treatment level of self-control, this cognitive process variable also could not account for outcome variance. The results offer limited support for the muscle-origins conception of tension headache and suggest the need for further research to clarify the contribution of physiological, cognitive and social factors to pain reduction.",1985,29,1,95-9,10.1016/0022-3999(85)90013-3,#3587,Abramowitz 1985,

904,31092897.0,A preliminary investigation of mechanisms by which short-term resistance training increases strength of partially paralysed muscles in people with spinal cord injury.,Spinal Cord,"STUDY DESIGN: Pretest-posttest design. OBJECTIVES: To investigate mechanisms by which short-term resistance training (6 weeks) increases strength of partially paralysed muscles in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). SETTING: Community-based setting, Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Ten community-dwelling people with partial paralysis of elbow flexor, elbow extensor, knee flexor or knee extensor muscles following SCI (range 5 months to 14 years since injury). METHODS: Muscle architecture and strength were assessed before and after participants underwent a six week strength-training program targeting one partially paralysed muscle group. The outcome of primary interest was physiological cross sectional area (PCSA) of the trained muscle group measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Other outcomes were changes in mean muscle fascicle length, muscle volume, pennation angle, isometric strength and muscle strength graded on a 13-point scale. RESULTS: The mean increase in maximal isometric muscle strength was 14% (95% CI, -3 to 30%) and 1.5 points (95% CI, 0.5 to 2.5) on the 13-point manual muscle test. There was no evidence of a change in muscle architecture. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to examine the mechanisms by which voluntary strength training increases strength of partially paralysed muscles in people with SCI. The data suggest that strength gains produced by six weeks of strength training are not caused by changes in muscle architecture. This suggests short-term strength gains are due to increased neural drive or an increase in specific muscle tension.",2019,57,9,770-777,10.1038/s41393-019-0284-2,#3589,Bye 2019,

This study examined the effects of applied muscle tension, a respiratory intervention, and a no treatment control condition, on presyncopal symptoms and cerebral oxygenation, during a simulated blood draw with individuals highly fearful of needles. Participants (n = 95) completed questionnaires, physiological monitoring, and two trials of a simulated blood draw with recovery. Presyncopal symptoms decreased across trials; however, no group differences emerged. Applied muscle tension was associated with greater cerebral oxygenation during trial two, and greater end-tidal carbon dioxide during both trials.

Regardless of treatment, whether conservative or surgical, clubfoot has a stubborn tendency to relapse, thus requiring postcorrection bracing. However, to date, there are no investigations specifically focused on clubfoot bracing from a bioengineering perspective. This study applied engineering principles to clubfoot bracing through construction of a surrogate biomodel. The surrogate was developed to represent an average 5-year-old human subject capable of biomechanical characteristics including joint articulation and kinematics. The components include skeleton, articulating joints, muscle-tendon systems, and ligaments. A protocol was developed to measure muscle-tendon tension in resting and braced positions of the surrogate. Measurement error ranged from 1% to 6% and was considered variance due to brace and investigator. In conclusion, this study shows that surrogate biomodeling is an accurate and repeatable method to investigate clubfoot bracing. The methodology is an effective means to evaluate wide ranging brace options and can be used to assist in future brace development and the tuning of brace parameters. Such patient-specific brace tuning may also lead to advanced braces that increase compliance.",2012,32,7,e47-52,10.1097/BPO.0b013e3182571656,#3592,DimeoAJSr 2012,

Metocurine, 0.3 mg/kg, was administered intravenously, and indirectly evoked thumb twitch tensions were measured on both sides in the hemiplegic patients, and on one side in the normal patients. Arterial blood samples were obtained as twitch tension was recovering, and serum metocurine concentrations were determined using a specific radioimmunoassay. Percentage of paralysis was plotted as a function of log [metocurine] and the data were compared by analysis of covariance. For the normal motor strength patients, r = 0.84; for the unaffected arm of the hemiplegic patients, r = 0.69; and for the affected arm of the hemiplegic patients, r = 0.86, all significant at P less than 0.001. The mean plasma metocurine concentrations at 20, 25, 50, 75, and 80% paralysis were significantly different for all groups (P less than 0.001).

909,9353687.0,Viscoelastic behavior of plantar flexor muscle-tendon unit at rest.,J Orthop Sports Phys Ther,"Muscle stretching as an exercise routine is widely used in orthopaedic and neurological rehabilitation. However, the muscle response to specific stretching parameters is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect parameters, such as stretch velocity, stretch extent, and initial muscle-tendon resistance, on the plantar flexor response to passive movement. Eighteen healthy subjects (23-41 years) participated in this study. Five passive ankle dorsiflexions were randomly imposed at various velocities from 5 degrees/sec to 180 degrees/sec using a Kin-Com dynamometer, while unwanted activations of the soleus and tibialis anterior muscles were detected with surface electrodes. The resistive torque was averaged at -10 degrees and 0 degree of dorsiflexion. As shown by analyses of variance followed by Scheffé post hoc procedures, the resistive torque was significantly increased (p < 0.01) between 5 degrees/sec and higher velocities (60 degrees/sec or 120 degrees/sec and higher). A strong linear resistive torque-velocity relationship was also observed, as indicated by Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 (-10 degrees) and 0.91 (0 degree). The absolute resistive torque increment, calculated at 180 degrees/sec, was larger at 0 degree of dorsiflexion than at the -10 degrees of dorsiflexion position. Finally, subjects with larger initial plantar flexor resistance had a higher resistive torque increment (p < 0.05) at a high velocity of stretch (180 degrees/sec) than those with less initial muscle-tendon resistance. These results indicate that 1) the nonreflex resistive torque response to stretch is velocity-sensitive and 2) both a larger stretch extent and muscle initial resistance lead to greater resistive torque increments at high velocity. These observations suggest that slow and gradual stretching procedures, rather than rapid or ballistic movements, should be used, especially with stiff muscles to reduce the chance of injury from excessively high tension.",1997,26,5,244-52,10.2519/jospt.1997.26.5.244,#3594,Lamontagne 1997,
910,9140847.0,Soft tissue manipulation: neuromuscular and muscle energy techniques.,J Neurosci Nurs,"Muscle rigidity and spasms occur with neurological disease and may contribute to contractures and shortening of muscle fibers that can interfere with motor behaviors, such as ambulation, or activities of daily living, such as combing hair, feeding or dressing. The neuromuscular technique (NMT) and muscle energy technique (MET) are nursing interventions that can reduce pain and muscle rigidity, lengthen muscle fibers and increase range of motion necessary for normal motor behavior. Nurses can use these techniques in patients with acute neurological diseases and those recovering in rehabilitation and long-term care settings. With some neurological diseases, muscle rigidity, increased muscle tone and muscle spasms reduce the range of motion of joints and the quality of movement. These changes often lead to contractures and impairments in performing daily tasks or ambulating, and thus, to loss of independence. Soft tissue manipulation can be used to reduce muscle tension and spasms, reduce pain and enhance the range of motion of joints whose function depends on the involved muscles. Soft tissue manipulation may also improve movement during specific tasks. Although the muscle relaxation achieved with manipulation techniques is primarily short-term, long-term effects occur. This article describes two techniques of soft tissue manipulation, their mechanisms of action, assessment and implementation. A case study is used to illustrate application of the techniques and possible long-term effects.",1997,29,2,123-7,10.1097/01376517-199704000-00006,#3595,Roberts 1997,

Collateral vessel formation is the result of angiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor (VPF), is a secreted mitogen specific for endothelial cells and an extremely potent angiogenic factor. In the present study, VPF/VEGF mRNA and protein were demonstrated to be markedly stimulated in primary rat cardiac myocytes in vitro in response to reduction of the oxygen tension to 1% or inhibition of the electron transport chain. Four isoforms of VPF/VEGF were coordinately regulated by hypoxia, including a novel isoform not previously described. Phorbol ester and the depolarizing agent veratridine, stimulators of protein kinase C and calcium influx, respectively, were found to markedly increase VPF/VEGF mRNA expression in cardiac myocytes. Forskolin, a potent stimulator of adenylate cyclase, produced a small but significant increase in VPF/VEGF mRNA expression in the cardiac myocytes. However, only H7, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, inhibited the hypoxic induction of VPF/VEGF mRNA; inhibitors of calcium influx and the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II as well as inhibition of protein kinase A did not block the hypoxic induction of VPF/VEGF mRNA. This suggests that more than one signal transduction pathway is involved in regulating VPF/VEGF expression. The sensor that regulates the expression of hypoxia-responsive genes has been proposed to be a heme protein. Consistent with this model, transition metals initiate a genetic program similar to hypoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,76,5,758-66,10.1161/01.res.76.5.758,#3596,Levy 1995,

Patients with a history of sexual assault before 18 years (25.9%) endorsed fewer somatic symptoms, specifically fewer motor tension and autonomic GAD symptoms, than patients with other types of trauma.

913,1829038.0,The quantification of EMG normalization error.,Ergonomics,"Electromyography (EMG) and normalized EMG have been accepted as methods of quantifying the activity level of a muscle. Normalized EMG, in conjunction with the EMG/force relationship and muscle cross-sectional area data, allows researchers to estimate the amount of muscle force exerted across a joint. An accurate description of this muscle force is a critical input to models designed to describe the risk of injury of a task. In order to be able to make statements about the relative intensity of an EMG signal, researchers who use normalization procedures take a given EMG activity level, at a known joint angle, and relate it to some reference activity level obtained at that particular joint angle. However, there have been studies where the EMG activity of an unrestricted dynamic task, such as walking, cycling, performing an occupational task, etc., has been normalized with respect to an EMG value taken during a single maximum voluntary contraction performed at one reference joint angle. This practice will render inaccurate results because at different joint angles there are changes in the portion of the muscle within the viewing area of the electrode, as well as changes in the length/tension relationship of the muscle which would cause changes in the maximum EMG value. The present study was an attempt to quantify the errors associated with normalization relative to a reference EMG value collected at an arbitrary joint position. Four subjects performed a series of controlled trunk extension exertions. As they performed these exertions the EMG activities were collected for eight trunk muscles. The task EMG values that resulted were then: (1) all normalized with respect to the maximum EMG at a single arbitrary trunk angle and (2) each normalized with respect to that specific trunk angle's maximum EMG. The results show that for the primary trunk extensors (erector spinae) large errors (greater than 75%) resulted from normalization using a single reference point and the magnitude of these errors followed consistent patterns within subjects as a function of trunk angle.",1991,34,3,343-52,10.1080/00140139108967318,#3598,Mirka 1991,

METHOD: The authors provide a detailed description of the surgically relevant anatomy focusing on the close relationship among the lumbar plexus, psoas muscle and lateral spinal column. The surgical technique is detailed step by step, stressing how to avoid complications. A video clip of an XLIF is provided, and important perioperative considerations are listed in detail. CONCLUSION: The XLIF® approach is a safe procedure allowing an approach to the lateral lumbar spine. Nevertheless, the surgeon's knowledge of anatomical landmarks, response to visual and tactile cues, and intraoperative decision-making skills remain of paramount importance. KEY POINTS: • Correct lateral positioning with an orthogonal orientation of the corresponding lumbar vertebral body is of key importance. • Subsequent table repositioning for every level is advised in multilevel cases. • Posterior structures including the paraspinous muscles, facet joint complexes and tension bands are mostly preserved. • Meticulous preoperative planning of the psoas docking point, considering all level-specific vascular and neuronal elements, is of paramount importance. • In general, concavity is recommended for the selection of the approach side. • A careful endplate and contralateral preparation and release are mandatory in order to allow bony fusion and maximum indirect foraminal decompression. • Using a perioperative dexamethasone bolus seems to be effective at the L4/5 level to reduce postoperative plexopathy. • Overdistraction should be avoided in order to prevent cage subsidence. • A major disadvantage is the relatively high, but mostly only transient, incidence of psoas weakness as well as hip-groin-thigh pain, dysaesthesia and/or numbness. • Major advantages include indirect neurological decompression, minimal blood loss, shorter operation times, decreased overall infection rates and more surface for bony fusion.",2015,157,3,547-51,10.1007/s00701-014-2248-9,#3599,Berjano 2015,

There are, however, few data on the associations between immune-inflammatory pathways and prenatal depression and physio-somatic symptoms. This study examined the associations between serum zinc, C-reactive protein (CRP), and haptoglobin at the end of term and prenatal physio-somatic symptoms (fatigue, back pain, muscle pain, dyspepsia, obstipation) and prenatal and postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms as measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), and Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Zinc and haptoglobin were significantly lower and CRP increased at the end of term as compared with non-pregnant women. Prenatal depression was predicted by lower zinc and lifetime history of depression, anxiety, and premenstrual tension syndrome (PMS). The latter histories were also significantly and inversely related to lower zinc. The severity of prenatal EDPS, HAMD, BDI, STAI, and physio-somatic symptoms was predicted by fatigue in the first and second trimesters, a positive life history of depression, anxiety, and PMS, and lower zinc and higher CRP. Postnatal depressive symptoms are predicted by prenatal depression, physio-somatic symptoms, zinc and CRP. Prenatal depressive and physio-somatic symptoms have an immune-inflammatory pathophysiology, while postnatal depressive symptoms are highly predicted by prenatal immune activation, prenatal depression, and a lifetime history of depression and PMS.

Implications for obsessive-compulsive disorder.,J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We have previously reported that obsessive-compulsive individuals perform more poorly on tasks that require accurate perception of internal states. As these individuals are also characterized by elevated levels of doubt regarding internal states, the causal relationship between doubt and accurate perception remained unclear. The presented study examines whether undermining participants' confidence in their ability to accurately produce a specific internal state would affect their performance on a task that requires accurate perception of this state. METHODS: Participants were trained to produce specific levels of forearm muscle tension and then required to produce various tension levels in four experimental phases. The first three alternated in terms of whether the participants viewed a biofeedback monitor while the fourth offered participants several times the choice to view the monitor. Prior to the task, half of the participants received instructions that undermined their confidence in their ability to accurately assess their own muscle tension. We measured participants' accuracy in producing the required muscle tension levels and the number of times they requested to view the monitor in the final phase. RESULTS: Undermined confidence participants were less accurate in producing the required muscle tension levels in the absence of biofeedback, and were also more likely to request the monitor in the final phase. CONCLUSIONS: Doubt can affect performance on tasks that require perceiving and experiencing internal states. This finding supports the possibility that access to internal states in OCD is attenuated due to elevated levels of doubt regarding these states.",2015,49,Pt B,150-156,10.1016/j.jbtep.2014.11.003,#3602,Lazarov 2015,Biofeedback
918,6429694.0,The effect of smoking on perception of muscle tension.,Psychopharmacology (Berl),"It has been suggested that smoking may reduce affect in high-arousal situations by blocking peripheral physiological cues. The effects of smoking on perception of one type of physiological response, muscle activity, was evaluated in two studies. In study 1 male and female smokers were exposed to four conditions: high and low arousal crossed with smoking or deprivation. Results showed that smokers produce less muscle activity during high- than low-arousal situations, and that smoking reduced sensitivity to muscle activity in females, but enhanced it in males. These perception differences were not related to arousal as assessed by heart rate, which was elevated in all high-arousal situations. When compared to nonsmokers, smokers in a deprived state generate more muscle activity during the perception task, but showed no differences in sensitivity. These results represent the initial demonstration that smoking can alter the perception of physiological processes. Study 2 was designed to determine whether the effects of smoking were specific to muscle tension or indicative of a more generalized perceptual change. Perception of muscle tension and decibel levels were compared in smoking or deprived female smokers who were in the high-arousal situation. Results for muscle-tension perception in high-arousal situations were similar to those in study 1, but smoking did not alter perception of auditory stimuli.",1984,83,1,107-13,10.1007/BF00427433,#3603,Epstein 1984,
919,28898058.0,Mechanoregulation of SM22α/Transgelin.,Biochemistry,"SM22α, also named transgelin, is an actin filament-associated protein in smooth muscle and fibroblasts. Three decades after its discovery, the biological function of SM22α remains under investigation. Here we report a novel finding that the expression and degradation of SM22α/transgelin are regulated by mechanical tension. Following a mass spectrometry identification of SM22α degradation in isolated and tension-unloaded mouse aorta, we developed specific monoclonal antibodies to study the regulation of SM22α in human fetal lung myofibroblast line MRC-5 and primary cultures of neonatal mouse skin fibroblasts. The level of SM22α is positively related to the mechanical tension in the cytoskeleton produced by the myosin II motor in response to the stiffness of the culture matrix. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the expression of SM22α is regulated at the transcriptional level. This mechanical regulation resembles that of calponin 2, another actin filament-associated protein. Immunofluorescent staining co-localized SM22α with F-actin, myosin, and calponin 2 in mouse skin fibroblasts. The close phylogenetic relationship between SM22α and the calponin family supports that SM22α is a calponin-like regulatory protein. The level of SM22α is decreased in skin fibroblasts isolated from calponin 2 knockout mice, suggesting interrelated regulation and function of the two proteins. On the other hand, SM22α expression was maximized at a matrix stiffness higher than that for calponin 2 in the same cell type, indicating differentiated regulation and tension responsiveness. The novel mechanoregulation of SM22α/transgelin lays the groundwork for understanding its cellular functions.",2017,56,41,5526-5538,10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00794,#3604,Liu 2017,
920,17702371.0,Force generation of different human cardiac valve interstitial cells: relevance to individual valve function and tissue engineering.,J Heart Valve Dis,"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Cardiac valves perform highly sophisticated functions that depend upon the specific characteristics of the component interstitial cells (ICs). The ability of valve ICs to contribute to these functions may be related to the generation of different types of tension within the valve structure. The study aim was to characterize cellular morphology and the forces generated by valve ICs and to compare this with morphology and forces generated by other cell types. METHODS: Cultured human valve ICs, pericardial fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells were seeded in 3-D collagen gels and placed in a device that accurately measures the forces generated. Cell morphology was determined in seeded gels fixed in glutaraldehyde, stained with toluidine blue and visualized using a high-definition stereo light microscope. RESULTS: Valve ICs generated an average peak force of 30.9 +/- 10.4 dynes over a 24-h period which, unlike other cell types tested, increased as cell density decreased (R = 0.67, p <0.0001). The temporal pattern of force generation in mitral valve cells was significantly faster than in aortic or tricuspid cells (p <0.05). Microscopic examination revealed the formation of cellular processes establishing a cell/cell and cell/matrix network. When externally induced changes in matrix tension occurred, the valve ICs unlike the other cell types - did not respond to restore the previous level of tension.

921,12855320.0,Heat pain thresholds and cerebral event-related potentials following painful CO2 laser stimulation in chronic tension-type headache.,Pain,"Current opinion concerning the pathophysiology of tension-type headache (TTH) and its related pericranial muscle tenderness proposes a primary role of central sensitization at the level of dorsalhorn/trigeminal nucleus as well as the supraspinal level. Investigation of these phenomena can be conducted using laser-evoked potentials (LEPs), which are objective and quantitative neurophysiological tools for the assessment of pain perception. In the present study we examined features of LEPs, as well as cutaneous heat-pain thresholds to laser stimulation, in relation to the tenderness of pericranial muscles in chronic TTH resulting from pericranial muscle disorder, during a pain-free phase. Twelve patients with TTH and 11 healthy controls were examined using the Total Tenderness Scoring (TTS) system. The stimulus was a laser pulse generated by a CO(2) laser. The dorsum of the hand and the cutaneous zones corresponding to pericranial muscles were stimulated. Subjective perception of stimulus intensity was assessed by a visual analogue scale. Two responses, the earlier named N2a and the last named P2, were considered; the absolute latency was measured at the highest peak of each response. The N2a-P2 components' peak-to-peak amplitude was detected. The heat pain threshold was similar in TTH patients and controls at the level of both the hand and pericranial skin. The TTS scores at almost all pericranial sites were higher in TTH patients than in normal controls. The amplitude of the N2a-P2 complex elicited by stimulation of the pericranial zone was greater in TTH patients than in controls; the amplitude increase was significantly associated with the TTS score. Our findings suggest that pericranial tenderness may be a primary phenomenon that precedes headache, and is mediated by a greater pain-specific hypervigilance at the cortical level.",2003,104,2-Jan,111-9,10.1016/s0304-3959(02)00485-2,#3606,deTommaso 2003,
922,2677639.0,Role of protein phosphorylation in Ca2+ regulated intracellular messenger systems.,Microcirc Endothelium Lymphatics,"We investigated the effects of a newly synthesized compound 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazepine (ML-9), a myosin light chain kinase (MLC-kinase) inhibitor, on contractile responses and on phosphorylation of 20 KDa myosin light chain (LC20) in collagen induced human platelet, and the intact and skinned vascular smooth muscle cells. ML-9 were found to bind at or near ATP-binding site of MLC-kinase molecule and inhibit the enzyme activity in competitive fashion with respect to ATP, with a Ki value of 3.8 microM in the presence or absence of Ca2+-calmodulin. ML-9 had no or little effect on any other enzymes tested in vitro over similar concentration range to inhibit MLC-kinase. ML-9 delayed the time course of LC20 phosphorylation, sequentially led to a delay in aggregation and serotonin secretion in a dose-dependent fashion in collagen-induced human platelet. ML-9 (10 microM) produced a shift to the right and down in dose-response curves of rabbit vascular strips to all agonist tested. ML-9 also suppressed the Ca2+-induced contraction of saponin-treated skinned fibers. We then examined the relationship between ML-9-induced inhibition of isometric tension development after addition of 50 mM KCl and the extent of LC20 phosphorylation in vascular smooth muscle. ML-9 not only inhibited the maximal extent of LC20 phosphorylation but also delayed the time course of the phosphorylation, in a dose-dependent manner. The initial rate of isometric tension development correlated to the extent of phosphorylation of the LC20. Thus, ML-9 should prove to be a specific and potent MLC-kinase inhibitor for investigating the physiological role of myosin light chain phosphorylation by MLC-kinase, in vivo and in vitro.",1989,5,2-Jan,13-29,,#3607,Hidaka 1989,

It was investigated whether information alone induced physiological and psychological responses, and whether information modified the response to the drug. METHODS: Half of the subjects received capsules containing 525 mg carisoprodol together with information that the drug acted in a specific way (Groups Relaxant/C, Stimulant/C, and No Information/C). The other half of the subjects received lactose (Groups Relaxant/L, Stimulant/L, and No Information/L). Dependent variables were blink reflexes and skin conductance responses, subjective measures of tension and sleepiness, and serum carisoprodol and meprobamate concentrations. Recordings were made between 15 and 130 minutes after administration of the capsules. RESULTS: The Stimulant/L group reported more tension compared with the other two groups, and carisoprodol increased tension even more in the Stimulant/C group. The Relaxant/C group displayed higher levels of carisoprodol serum concentration compared with the other groups that received carisoprodol. CONCLUSIONS: Reported tension was modulated in the direction suggested by the stimulant information. The effect of carisoprodol on tension was also modulated by stimulant information. Increased carisoprodol absorption in the group that received relaxant information could be a mechanism in the placebo response.",1999,61,2,250-5,10.1097/00006842-199903000-00018,#3609,Flaten 1999,
925,17722948.0,Regulation of cerebral blood flow during exercise.,Sports Med,"Constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) is vital to human survival. Originally thought to receive steady blood flow, the brain has shown to experience increases in blood flow during exercise. Although increases have not consistently been documented, the overwhelming evidence supporting an increase may be a result of an increase in brain metabolism. While an increase in metabolism may be the underlying causative factor for the increase in CBF during exercise, there are many modulating variables. Arterial blood gas tensions, most specifically the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, strongly regulate CBF by affecting cerebral vessel diameter through changes in pH, while carbon dioxide reactivity increases from rest to exercise. Muscle mechanoreceptors may contribute to the initial increase in CBF at the onset of exercise, after which exercise-induced hyperventilation tends to decrease flow by pial vessel vasoconstriction. Although elite athletes may benefit from hyperoxia during intense exercise, cerebral tissue is well protected during exercise, and cerebral oxygenation does not appear to pose a limiting factor to exercise performance. The role of arterial blood pressure is important to the increase in CBF during exercise; however, during times of acute hypotension such as during diastole at high-intensity exercise or post-exercise hypotension, cerebral autoregulation may be impaired. The impairment of an increase in cardiac output during exercise with a large muscle mass similarly impairs the increase in CBF velocity, suggesting that cardiac output may play a key role in the CBF response to exercise. Glucose uptake and CBF do not appear to be related; however, there is growing evidence to suggest that lactate is used as a substrate when glucose levels are low. Traditionally thought to have no influence, neural innervation appears to be a protective mechanism to large increases in cardiac output. Changes in middle cerebral arterial velocity are independent of changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity, suggesting that sympathetic activity does not alter medium-sized arteries (middle cerebral artery).CBF does not remain steady, as seen by apparent increases during exercise, which is accomplished by a multi-factorial system, operating in a way that does not pose any clear danger to cerebral tissue during exercise under normal circumstances.",2007,37,9,765-82,10.2165/00007256-200737090-00002,#3610,Querido 2007,

Assessment of the physiological determinants of performance is an integral part of sports science support for elite athletes. Laboratory and field-based physiological assessments are fundamental elements in profiling athletes, assessing training adaptations, and interrogating programme efficacy. The relatively small and highly specific adaptations associated with high-performance training call for valid, reliable, and sensitive methods of assessment. Recent advances in the physiological assessment of athletes have led to the development of a plethora of laboratory and field-based procedures. In the assessment of the athlete, there is a tension between the high reliability and low ecological validity of laboratory assessments and the low reliability and high validity of field-based methods. In an attempt to enhance ecological validity of training and physiological assessment, various sports-specific ergometers have been designed. This development has helped to match fitness assessment procedures to the demands of the sport concerned.",2009,27,6,575-89,10.1080/02640410902729741,#3611,Reilly 2009,

A double-blind methodology was used. Three groups of subjects assigned to the pseudofeedback conditions received a feedback signal that was not contingent on EMG activity but that followed one of three different patterns. One group received a truly random signal, the second received a signal that gradually increased in frequency (apparent failure), and the third received a signal that gradually decreased in frequency (apparent success). Dependent measures included both physiologic (frontal and neck EMG) and subjective reactions to the relaxation task. The different patterns of pseudofeedback did produce reliably different subjective responses, suggesting that the manipulations succeeded in producing unequal nonspecific effects that were unrelated to the feedback contingency specifically. However, these differential subjective effects were not strongly reflected in the physiologic responses since the differences in EMG levels among the four groups did not differ significantly at any stage of training. An analysis of the integrity of the double-blind procedure showed that although experimenters were effectively kept blind to group assignment, subjects' responding suggested a response bias as well as the possibility that the double-blind was breached. The utility of the double-blind methodology in biofeedback experiments is discussed and suggestions for future research are offered.",1983,8,3,409-25,10.1007/BF00998750,#3612,Hatch 1983,

Three homologous genes, CNN1, CNN2 and CNN3, encoding calponin isoforms 1, 2, and 3, respectively, are present in vertebrate species. All three calponin isoforms are actin-binding proteins with functions in inhibiting actin-activated myosin ATPase and stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton, while each isoform executes different physiological roles based on their cell type-specific expressions. Calponin 1 is specifically expressed in smooth muscle cells and plays a role in fine-tuning smooth muscle contractility. Calponin 2 is expressed in both smooth muscle and non-muscle cells and regulates multiple actin cytoskeleton-based functions. Calponin 3 participates in actin cytoskeleton-based activities in embryonic development and myogenesis. Phosphorylation has been extensively studied for the regulation of calponin functions. Cytoskeleton tension regulates the transcription of CNN2 gene and the degradation of calponin 2 protein.

931,28758595.0,"Vasodilator Effect of Angiotensin-(1-7) on Vascular Coronary Bed of Rats: Role of Mas, ACE and ACE2.",Protein Pept Lett,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin(Ang)-(1-7) is a biologically active member of the reninangiotensin system that participates of the regulation of blood pressure. Although Ang-(1-7) is able to potentiate the vasodilator effect of bradykinin in coronary bed of rats, a direct vasodilator effect of Ang-(1-7) in this vascular bed has not been characterized. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the vasodilator effect of Ang-(1-7) in the vasculature of isolated rat hearts perfused according to the Langendorff technique at constant flow. METHODS: Isolated hearts, after approximately 30 minutes of stabilization, were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution (KRS) alone (control) or KRS containing Ang-(1-7). The participation of the Ang-(1-7) receptor Mas, AT1 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 was evaluated perfusing hearts with a combination of Ang-(1-7) plus A779, Ang-(1-7) plus losartan, Ang-(1-7) plus captopril/enalapril and Ang-(1-7) plus DX-600, respectively. RESULTS: Ang-(1-7) induced a significant decrease in the perfusion pressure, indicating a direct vasodilatation action of this peptide in the coronary bed. This effect was abolished by A779, captopril, enalapril and DX-600 an ACE2-specific inhibitor. However, AT1 blockade did not blunt the Ang-(1-7) effect. No significant changes were observed in heart rate, as well as in contractile tension and ±dT/dt. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of Ang-(1-7) and Mas in coronary vessels. CONCLUSION: The Ang-(1-7) concentration used in this study was unable to induce changes in the cardiac function since no consistent alterations in contraction force and HR were viewed after Ang- (1-7) perfusion. In summary, this study showed that Ang-(1-7) induces vasodilation in the coronary bed of rats and this effect involves coupling to Mas receptor and interaction with ACE and ACE2.",2017,24,9,869-875,10.2174/0929866524666170728154459,#3616,deMoraes 2017,A779

The research concerned a group of 59 children, 22 girls and 37 boys, mean age 12.5 +/- 1.24 years, with tension type headaches. Their clinical results (neurological, neuropsychological, radiological and laboratory) were normal, suggesting psychosomatic etiology. The characteristics of the headache correspond to a nosologic entity known as tension-type headache. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological characteristics of these children and their families, especially the profile of the mothers. The psychological assessment, consecutively applied, comprised: Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Emotions Profile Index (EPI), General Anxiety State (GAS) and Human Values Rank (HVR). The mothers were examined by Family Inventory Life Events (FILE) and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and also checked with the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL). The results obtained showed a non-negligible level of actual anxiety in all the children, who were mostly the first-born and lived in families with accentuated stress. The emotional profile of the children was characterized by impulsiveness, a feeling of fear, moderate aggression, but still with a great level of acceptability. The EPQ confirmed their extroversion, moderate neurotic manifestations and a need for social acceptance. These results suggest that in preadolescents emotional stress, combined with a ""model"" for somatization, could provoke specific involuntary contraction of the head and neck muscles causing local ischaemia, which may be the pathophysiologic cause of a tension-type headache. The therapy comprised EDR and EMG biofeedback, applied once per week, of 50-minute duration. The results obtained after 20 sessions are very satisfactory. In addition, some response-measures involving a change and adjustment of family relations and school environment are recommended.

Measures of passive (tonic) and active (phasic) forearm flexor EMG activity were derived. It was concluded that serious-mindedness was significant to a tonic build-up of tension in the passive forearm flexor over the course of task performance. In contrast, the playful state was associated with high phasic response amplitudes in the active forearm flexor contingent upon changing the position of the joy-stick.

A misunderstanding of the functional anatomy of the neck may explain these unsatisfactory surgical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The author analyzes the functional anatomy of the platysma (PLA) and of the hyoplatysma ligament. The depressor labii lateralis (DLL) is described for the first time. METHODS: The PLA was dissected in 4 fresh adult cadavers to infer its function and to reevaluate current knowledge regarding this anatomic region. In addition, 30 patients who presented to the author's private practice for rejuvenation of the lower face were photographed undergoing specific muscle contractions for functional analysis. RESULTS: The PLA functions as a neck elevator only. Lower lip traction is controlled by independent antagonistic muscles, including the depressor labii inferioris, the anguli oris, and the DLL. The juxtaposition of these antagonistic muscles occurs at the mandibular line, which explains why the aging process is so distinct in this area. The hyoplatysmal ligament is responsible for the creation and stability of the acute cervicomandibular angle. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of neck rejuvenation should be to restore elongation of the PLA posteriorly and to create posterior tension in the submental skin. Vertical platysmaplasty should be replaced with horizontal suturing of the PLA toward the hyoid and then to the skin to recreate the cervicomandibular angle and the submental area of the patient in youth.",2016,61,2,101-9,10.1016/j.anplas.2015.12.002,#3626,LeLouarn 2016,Hyoid bone

Little is known about how these mutations influence the affinity of cardiac TnC for cTnI (KC-I) or contractile kinetics during β-adrenergic stimulation. Here, we tested how cTnI(R146G) or cTnI(R21C) influences contractile activation and relaxation and their response to protein kinase A (PKA). Both mutations significantly increased Ca(2+) binding affinity to cTn (KCa) and KC-I. PKA phosphorylation resulted in a similar reduction of KCa for all complexes, but KC-I was reduced only with cTnI(WT). cTnI(WT), cTnI(R146G), and cTnI(R21C) were complexed into cardiac troponin and exchanged into rat ventricular myofibrils, and contraction/relaxation kinetics were measured ± PKA phosphorylation. Maximal tension (Tmax) was maintained for cTnI(R146G)- and cTnI(R21C)-exchanged myofibrils, and Ca(2+) sensitivity of tension (pCa50) was increased. PKA phosphorylation decreased pCa50 for cTnI(WT)-exchanged myofibrils but not for either mutation. PKA phosphorylation accelerated the early slow phase relaxation for cTnI(WT) myofibrils, especially at Ca(2+) levels that the heart operates in vivo. Importantly, this effect was blunted for cTnI(R146G)- and cTnI(R21C)-exchanged myofibrils. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest both mutations inhibit formation of intra-subunit contacts between the N terminus and the inhibitory peptide of cTnI that is normally seen with WT-cTn upon PKA phosphorylation. Together, our results suggest that cTnI(R146G) and cTnI(R21C) blunt PKA modulation of activation and relaxation kinetics by prohibiting cardiac-specific N-terminal interaction with the cTnI inhibitory peptide.",2015,290,46,27749-66,10.1074/jbc.M115.683045,#3627,Cheng 2015,C-I interaction

A. Beaton, 2003; L. Jäncke, K. Specht, S. Mirzazade, & M. Peters, 1999; I. C. McManus & K. M. Cornish, 1997; M. Peters, 1995; P. J. Snyder, R. M. Bilder, H. Wu, B. Bogerts, & J. A. Lieberman, 1995). For example, J. Tichy and J. Belacek ( 2008 , 2009 ) identified a link between cerebellar dominance and hand preference. The authors aimed to assess the relationship between cerebellar dominance and handedness, in 8-10-year-olds (N = 157 right-handers) as assessed with hand performance tests. Articular joint passivity in the wrist and performance differences between the hands were used as a means of assessing cerebellar dominance, where a link to skilled hand performance tests was revealed. Specifically, significant correlations between articular joint passivity and all measurements of handedness (p < .001) were observed. Greater hypotonia was seen in the left wrist of 95% of right-handers. This result supports the assumption that the preferred and nonpreferred hand could be controlled by the cerebellum in a different ways.",2015,47,5,386-96,10.1080/00222895.2014.1003778,#3628,Musalek 2015,cerebellar dominance
944,22841959.0,Obsessive-compulsive tendencies may be associated with attenuated access to internal states: evidence from a biofeedback-aided muscle tensing task.,Conscious Cogn,"The present study was motivated by the hypothesis that inputs from internal states in obsessive-compulsive (OC) individuals are attenuated, which could be one source of the pervasive doubting and checking in OCD. Participants who were high or low in OC tendencies were asked to produce specific levels of muscle tension with and without biofeedback, and their accuracy in producing the required muscle tension levels was assessed. As predicted, high OC participants performed more poorly than low OC participants on this task when biofeedback was not available. When biofeedback was provided, the difference between the groups was eliminated, and withdrawing the monitor again reversed this effect. Finally, when given the opportunity, high OC participants were more likely than low OC participants to request biofeedback. These results suggest that doubt in OCD may be grounded in a real and general deficiency in accessing internal states.",2012,21,3,1401-9,10.1016/j.concog.2012.07.002,#3629,Lazarov 2012,
945,19794421.0,Separation-individuation issues and castration anxiety: their curious influence on the epigenesis of myopia.,Am J Psychoanal,"This author suggests that myopia is related to psychogenic factors involving an unconscious representation of, and defense against tension. Further, the argument is made that such tension directly causes the extra-ocular muscles of the eyeball to tighten, ultimately creating the errors of refraction, which define the condition known as myopia. The author makes the case that the specific nature of the tension has to do with an interruption in the separation-individuation process that has occurred, in which the myopic individual experiences separation anxiety, and is now ""required"" to stay close to the mother for fear of abandonment. Apparently, the only way myopes are then able to achieve some sort of psychological distance is through the development of high-level abstract conceptualization abilities. In addition to separation fears, this author notes that myopes exhibit significantly higher levels of castration anxiety as compared with normal-sighted individuals, matched in IQ.

METHODS: Segments of umbilical artery (n = 12) and umbilical vein (n = 8) from male and female fetuses were suspended in organ baths of Krebs solution for isometric tension recording. The vessels were contracted using 60 mM potassium chloride followed by exposure to increasing concentrations (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) of sex steroid hormones (estradiol-17 beta, estriol, estrone, testosterone, and progesterone). A specific estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 164, 384) was used to attempt to block the estradiol effect. Changes in tension were recorded. RESULTS: Of the agents tested, estradiol-17 beta had the greatest effect (25-29% relaxation at 10(-4) M concentration), which was uninhibited by a specific receptor antagonist. The other steroids tested had no significant effect, even at 10(-4) M concentration. The umbilical artery is slightly more sensitive to the effects of estradiol than the umbilical vein. There were no gender-specific differences noted in either artery or vein harvested from male or female fetuses.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective prevalence study. METHODS: A total of 821 patients were enrolled. Each patient was evaluated following a multidimensional protocol including videolaryngostroboscopy, perception, acoustics, aerodynamics, and self-rating by the patient. Data regarding age, gender, tobacco use, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and professional voice use were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Based on videolaryngoscopic findings, the sample group was divided into patients with functional dysphonia (n = 155), patients with organic dysphonia (n = 359), and patients with dysphonia due to movement disorders (n = 307). The most frequently detected pathologies were vocal fold paralysis, muscle tension dysphonia, and vocal fold edema. Children (n = 41) and adolescents (n = 43) represented a minority of the sample group. Dysphonia was significantly more common in women. Organic dysphonia was more common in children and adolescents. GERD was suspected in 382 patients and confirmed in 83 of them; 164 patients were smokers. Professional voice users composed the large majority of the working population and were more frequently affected by organic dysphonia. Patients with dysphonia due to movement disorders presented a worse voice quality and voice-related quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: In patients seeking voice therapy, there are more females than males, children and adolescents represent a minority of the sample, professional voice users more commonly present organic dysphonia, and patients with dysphonia due to movement disorders show significantly worse voice quality.",2016,30,6,774.e13-774.e21,10.1016/j.jvoice.2015.11.018,#3633,Mozzanica 2016,Dysphonia
949,8147839.0,Myocardial adaptation to stress from the viewpoint of adaptation and development.,Basic Res Cardiol,"Myocardial adaptation to stress and development includes reorganization of subcellular systems. Using a myothermal method, changes in the contractile protein system were investigated across species (rat, rabbit, human myocardium) and in consequence of hemodynamic (volume overload human, pressure overload rabbit myocardium) or hormonal stresses (hypothyroid rat, hyperthyroid rabbit myocardium). Mechanical and myothermal measurements were performed in isometrically contracting right or left ventricular muscle strips and the force-time integral of the individual crossbridge cycle was calculated from heat and force data. Within species, crossbridge force-time integral increased by 85% from control human to volume overload human myocardium. Crossbridge force-time integral increased by 100% from control to hypothyroid rat myocardium. In rabbit myocardium, crossbridge force-time integral increased by 164% in pressure overload and decreased by 47% in hyperthyroid compared to control myocardium. Across species, crossbridge force-time integral was smallest in control rat myocardium (0.16 +/- 0.01 pNs) and increased in the order: control rat < hyperthyroid rabbit < hypothyroid rat, control rabbit < control human < pressure overload rabbit < volume overload human myocardium (0.96 +/- 0.01 pNs). Within and across species, crossbridge force-time integral was positively correlated with time to peak tension (r = 0.86; p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with maximum rate of tension rise (r = -0.85; p < 0.05) and maximum rate of tension fall (r = -0.78; p < 0.05). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between crossbridge force-time integral and total activity related heat (r = -0.81; p < 0.05) as well as total activity related heat per tension-time integral (r = -0.89; p < 0.005). Thus, the close relationship between crossbridge force-time integral and myocardial function within and across species demonstrates that alterations of crossbridge force-time integral reflect an important mechanism of subcellular adaptation to stress from a mechanical point of view. Moreover, alterations of the crossbridge force-time integral have pronounced effects on energy consumption in the different types of myocardium.",1993,88 Suppl 2,,91-102,,#3634,Hasenfuss 1993,
950,20164197.0,Phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I at protein kinase C site threonine 144 depresses cooperative activation of thin filaments.,J Biol Chem,"There is evidence for PKC-dependent multisite phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at Ser-23 and Ser-24 (also PKA sites) in the cardiac-specific N-terminal extension and at Thr-144, a unique residue in the inhibitory region. The functional effect of these phosphorylations in combination is of interest in view of data indicating intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal extension and the inhibitory region of cTnI. To determine the role of PKC-dependent phosphorylation of cTnI on sarcomeric function, we measured contractile regulation at multiple levels of complexity. Ca(2+) binding to thin filaments reconstituted with either cTnI(wild-type) or pseudo-phosphorylated cTnI(S23D/S24D), cTnI(T144E), and cTnI(S23D/S24D/T144E) was determined. Compared with controls regulated by cTnI(wild-type), thin filaments with cTnI(S23D/S24D) and cTnI(S23D/S24D/T144E) exhibited decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity. In contrast, there was no significant difference between Ca(2+) binding to thin filaments with cTnI(wild-type) and with cTnI(T144E). Studies of the pCa-force relations in skinned papillary fibers regulated by these forms of cTnI yielded similar results. However, in both the Ca(2+) binding measurements and the skinned fiber tension measurements, the presence of cTnI(S23D/S24D/T144E) induced a much lower Hill coefficient than either wild type, S23D/S24D, or T144E. These data highlight the importance of thin filament-based cooperative mechanisms in cardiac regulation, with implications for mechanisms of control of function in normal and pathological hearts.",2010,285,16,11810-7,10.1074/jbc.M109.055657,#3635,Lu 2010,
951,29577244.0,Treatment of scalp dysesthesia utilising simple exercises and stretches: A pilot study.,Australas J Dermatol,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Scalp dysesthesia is characterised by abnormal cutaneous sensations such as burning, stinging or itching of the scalp in the absence of objective dermatological findings. We hypothesised that the unpleasant sensations are the result of a sensory neuropathy secondary to cervical spine dysfunction and chronic tension of the pericranial muscles. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the use of an exercise protocol consisting of cervical spine range of movement exercises, gentle mobilisation and muscle stretches over 4 weeks. The exercise protocol was designed to relieve cervical nerve compression through the restoration of cervical homeostasis. METHODS: In total, 16 participants, aged 18-71 (average 45 years), diagnosed with scalp dysesthesia were recruited from an outpatient dermatology clinic and given instructions on how to perform a specifically designed exercise protocol twice daily for 4 weeks. Baseline characteristics and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pruritus were recorded prior to commencement and a VAS for pruritus recorded weekly thereafter. RESULTS: At week 4, 10 participants experienced a satisfactory reduction in their symptoms, four experienced complete resolution and two experienced no benefit, with no adverse effects reported. We conclude that a programme of simple exercises and stretches is an effective treatment for scalp dysesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: This low-risk treatment is easily implemented, non-invasive and non-pharmacological. Within the limits of this small pilot study, benefits are shown, and we believe further research is warranted.",2018,59,4,318-321,10.1111/ajd.12807,#3636,Laidler 2018,exercise
952,31987527.0,Alexander Technique classes improve pain and performance factors in tertiary music students.,J Bodyw Mov Ther,"BACKGROUND: Professional and student instrumental musicians experience high rates of playing-related pain (PR pain) and other playing-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). This significant occupational health risk signals an urgent need for preventive education at the college level. During tertiary studies however, music students may be more focused on musical skill development than health outcomes. Alexander Technique (AT) is reputed to be beneficial for factors relating to both PR pain and the improvement of performance quality in musicians, therefore AT training for music students could be relevant for prevention. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of AT classes for tertiary music students on PR pain, associated risk factors for PR pain, and factors associated with improvements in music performance quality. METHODS: Responses were collected from 23 volunteer music performance students at an Australian University who undertook weekly AT classes for one semester using a curriculum specifically designed for music students. RESULTS: The majority of participants rated AT classes as beneficial for all factors, particularly reduction of PR pain, posture, ability to release excess muscle tension, improvements in instrumental technique, and improvements in performance level. Benefits to practice effectiveness and a reduction in non-playing-related pain, stress levels and performance anxiety were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Purpose-designed AT classes may contribute to the management of PR pain and pertinent risk factors in music students, thus further investigation of the potential role of AT classes in pain prevention programs is warranted. Reports of benefit across a range of performance-related skills strengthen relevance to music practice and performance.",2020,24,1,7-Jan,10.1016/j.jbmt.2019.04.006,#3637,Davies 2020,Alexander Technique

Results indicated that level of appraised coping efficacy had the most pronounced effect during stressor exposure and that the pattern of this effect was dependent on whether the source of the appraised coping resources was ""personal"" (the subject's own resources) or ""environmental"" (a bogus technique donated by the experimenter). In addition, information about personal resources reduced the pre- to poststressor increment in state anxiety and lessened cognitive avoidance of stressor-related stimuli. Results were discussed with respect to differential sensitivity of components of stress response to variation in environmental versus personal sources of coping efficacy, and the specific aspects of cognitive structuring associated with variation in physiological reaction (muscle tension) were noted. The importance of factors associated with appraised coping efficacy was clearly supported, but factors involving the objective (in contrast to defensive) aspects of appraised stressor potency required further investigation, and suggestions for such future research were made.",1976,33,5,632-46,10.1037//0022-3514.33.5.632,#3638,Neufeld 1976,
954,29945400.0,[Precise application of Traditional Chinese Medicine in minimally-invasive techniques].,Zhongguo Gu Shang,"The miminally-invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) uses different types of acupuncture needles to treat diseased locations with special techniques. These techniques include different methods of insertion and closed incision (press cutting, sliding cutting, scrape cutting, etc.). This needling technique is based on the traditional Chinese medicine theories of Pi Bu(cutaneous), Jing Jin(sinew), Jing Luo(meridian), Wu Ti(five body structure components) and Zang Fu(organ system). Commonly used needles include: needle Dao, needle with edge, Pi needle, Shui needle, Ren needle, Gou needle, Chang Yuan needle, Bo needle and so on. The principle of this minimally-invasive technique of TCM is to achieve the greatest healing benefit with the least amount of anatomical and physiological intervention. This will result in the highest standard of health care with the lowest rehabilitative need and burden of care. In the past 20 years, through the collaborative research of several hundred hospitals across China, we systemically reviewed the best minimally invasive technique of TCM and the first line treatments for selective conditions. In 2013, the Department of Medical Affairs of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine created ""Traditional Chinese Medicine Technical Manual""(General Version) and released it nationwide, its contents include: (1)Minimally invasive scar tissue release. ¹Suitable for Bi and pain syndromes of neck, shoulder, waist, buttocks and extremities. ²Degeneration causes local hypertrophy and inflammation, creating local tissue adhesion. ³There are two kind incision methods-press cutting and slide cutting. (2)Minimally invasive fascial tension release. ¹Suitable for localized fascial tension caused by trauma, overuse, or wind-cold-dampness, leading to compensatory hyperplasia. ²Long term high-stress stimulation to local fascia creates compensatory hyperplasia, Ashi points, and tissue texture changes (cords, nodules, masses). ³According to the different structural features of the needles, there are two incision methods: penetrating from the outside to the inside and pulling from inside to outside. (3)Minimally invasive decompression technique. ¹Suitable for internal pressure changes within organ cavities caused by trauma, degeneration, inflammation, such as compartment syndrome, bone marrow edema, increased intraluminal pressure in the bone marrow. ²According to the different tissues, it is categorized into soft tissue decompression, and bone decompression. (4)Minimally invasive orthopedic surgery. Applicable to some postural, developmental deformity correction, mainly through the dynamic balance method and/or static balance method. (5)Minimally invasive dissection. Suitable for fractures, tendons injury caused by deep soft tissue adhesion. (6)Minimally invasive separation. ¹Suitable for cutaneous, sinew regions, superficial adhesions due to lesions, and local post-operative incision adhesions. ²According to the structure of the needle tip, the methods are divided into sharp separation and blunt dissection. (7)Minimally invasive sustained pressure technique. ¹Suitable for neuromuscular dysfunction which causes JING(spasm) syndrome and WEI(atrophy) syndrome. ²The needle is applied with sustained pressure, without penetrating select tissue surface. This includes: nerve root sustained pressure technique; peripheral nerve sustained pressure technique; muscle sustained pressure technique; fascial contact procedure; cutaneous sustained pressure technique.(8)Minimally invasive insertion technique. ¹Suitable for systemic regulation to treat disease. ²Different organs are connected to different layers of tissue. Therefore, to treat specific conditions, specific tissues must be targeted. ³For example, back Shu points are used to treat vertigo from cervical spine issues, and spinal degeneration associated digestion issue. ⁴The internal organs can be regulated by the pathways that runs along the different layers of tissue. The types of stimulation include: meridian acupoint stimulation; cutaneous stimulation; fascia stimulation; mucle stimulation; periosteum stimulation. The clinical application of these techniques has enriched the drug-free therapies of traditional Chinese medicine and achieved excellent outcomes, but at the same time it also raises an important question. How can we apply these minimally invasive techniques to clinical practice so it can be safe and effective? In addition, how can practitioners, individually and further develop their understanding of this minimally invasive technique progressive manner? We make the following recommendations. (1)Clear diagnosis and precise application. Any approach has specific indications and choosing the correct technique comes from a comprehensive understanding of its advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the accurate application of the technique depends the expertise of the practitioner. Through systematic review and clinical observation, we formulated the First Line Treatment, the Second Line Treatment, and the Third Line Treatment for specific conditions. Using the information gathered from research, practitioners can decide on which point is appropriate to use based on the stage of disease progression. For example, common conditions like the nerve ending tension pain(i.e. cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome) is caused by stress concentration. There are two types of treatment for this condition: ¹Change in the response to stress state (i.e.non-invasive approach such as manual therapy and physiotherapy). ²Change in state of surrounding environment (i.e. invasive approach such as Pi Needle). Before tissue texture changes to pain point, cord, nodules, the former approach is effective. Once tissue texture changes, the latter approach is First Line Treatment. (2)Systematic training and disease progression training. The minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine can treat many kinds of disease. To ensure its safety, organization, progressive development, practitioners are trained systematically and manage their treatment approach through disease hierarchy. Moreover, this technique should be conducted according to its technical difficulty, operating conditions, and expertise of the practitioner. The application of minimally invasive techniques of traditional Chinese medicine does not depend on the hospitals' administration system or the regulatory college of medical professionals. The minimally invasive techniques of TCM should be taught from easy to difficult, simple to complicated, and requires gradual progression by the practitioners. Eventually, the minimally invasive techniques of TCM's diagnostic and treatment protocol can be created. These protocols are currently available for reference: ¹Forming diagnosis and differential diagnosis for the conditions below requires expert diagnostic and application skills: cerebral palsy; cervical vertigo; cervical headache; cervical precordial pain; other spine-related diseases. ²The requirements for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques are relatively high, and special training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The conditions below uses minimally invasive orthopedic surgery and dissection: scar contracture deformity; congenital developmental malformations; cervical Bi-syndrome; shoulder pain syndrome; knee Bi-syndrome; low back pain; cervical spondylosis; lumbar disc herniation; avascular necrosis of the femoral head; ankylosing spondylitis. ³There are no special requirements for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of such techniques, and special training is required for the practitioner who performs this technique. The technical content is mainly decompression and scar tissue release. a)Muscle strain diseases: levator scapulae, splenius capitis, splenius cervicis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, teres major, serratus posterior superior, serratus posterior inferior, piriformis, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus, erector spinae. b)Joint degenerative disorders: frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, tenosynovitis, knee osteoarthritis, and plantar fascitis. c)JING-JIN PI-BU pain syndrome (cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome): occipital great nerve entrapment syndrome, occipital small nerve entrapment syndrome, great auricular nerve entrapment syndrome, suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome, transverse cutaneous nerve of neck entrapment syndrome. (3)People-centred practice. The most attractive feature of the minimally invasive techniques of TCM is that they do not rely on expensive medical equipment and operating conditions. The key to applying this technique is the practitioners' technique, skill, and expertise. The necessary conditions required to successfully apply this technique is ¹practitioner understands disease progression and diagnosis; ²practitioners' skill in applying technique. We require patient-centered approach, which uses evidence based approach as the focus. We aim to seek the truth from facts, to understand the comprehensive picture, to include pertinent details, to be observant, to be goal oriented, from one to another, from outside to inside, from top to the bottom, compare right from left, through active movement and passive movements and weight-bearing movements, and assisted passive movements to determine instantaneous centre to diagnose stress concentration points. The operating technique is based on the response of patient's tissues to this technique. We must pay attention to diagnosis through palpation: layers, structure, texture, deformity, dislocation, movement characteristic, rhythmic changes. To achieve SHOU MO XIN HUI WU WEI: position, quantify, quantity, timing, and pattern. Accurate grasp of timeliness and dose efficiency. Can distinguish between local or systemic effects of treatment. Through comprehensive judgment of hands feeling, acupuncture needle feeling, and inspiration, to achieve the precious treatment requirements as indicated by the ""Huangdi Neijing·Suwen"": ""Puncture the bone without damaging tendons, and puncture tendons without damaging muscles, puncture the muscle without damaging pulse, puncture pulse without damaging skin, puncture skin without damaging muscle.

955,17012534.0,Anger management style and hostility among patients with chronic pain: effects on symptom-specific physiological reactivity during anger- and sadness-recall interviews.,Psychosom Med,"OBJECTIVES: We examined whether anger-in, anger-out, and hostility predicted symptom-specific muscle tension reactivity during anger induction (but not sadness induction) among patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). For patients with CLBP, relevant muscles are the lower paraspinals (LPs). Anger-in x hostility and anger-out x hostility interactions were tested to determine whether particularly reactive groups of patients could be identified with a multivariable profile approach. METHODS: Ninety-four patients with CLBP underwent anger recall (ARI) and sadness recall (SRI) interviews, whereas LP and trapezius electromyography and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded. They completed anger-in, anger-out, hostility, and trait anger measures. RESULTS: Hierarchical regressions were used to test anger-in x hostility and anger-out x hostility interactions for physiological changes during the ARI and SRI. A significant anger-in x hostility interaction was found for LP change during the ARI (but not SRI) such that high anger-in/high hostility patients evinced the greatest reactivity. Effects for trapezius reactivity were nonsignificant. Significant anger-in x hostility interactions were also found for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure changes during the ARI such that high anger-in/low hostility patients showed the smallest changes. The anger-out x hostility interaction for diastolic blood pressure change during ARI was also significant such that high anger-out/low hostility patients showed the smallest changes. All effects remained significant with trait anger controlled. CONCLUSIONS: A multivariable profile approach may help identify especially vulnerable patient groups. Patients with CLBP who tend to suppress anger and are cynically hostile may be more likely to experience high levels of muscle tension near the site of pain and injury during anger, but not during sadness, than other groups.",2006,68,5,786-93,10.1097/01.psy.0000238211.89198.e4,#3640,Burns 2006,
956,8175498.0,Discrimination of transiently applied mechanical loads: breathing vs. pulling.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"Two groups of 24 subjects each attempted to discriminate between large elastic and resistive loads during 50 randomized presentations of each load. Breathers inspired from the loads through a J valve, whereas pullers reciprocally stroked the plunger of a 2-liter syringe connected to the J valve. A range of load durations was obtained in each subject by prematurely unloading approximately one-half of the trials at graded times from their onset. Breathers produced random discrimination scores [50.8 +/- 2.5% (SE) correct] when loaded inspirations were shorter than unloaded inspirations [trials in which both loads induced equal airway pressure (and probably respiratory muscle tension) waveforms] and nonrandom discrimination scores (65.7 +/- 2.8% correct) when loaded inspirations were longer than unloaded inspirations (trials in which both loads induced different waveforms). In contrast, pullers produced nonrandom discrimination scores (62.2 +/- 2.9% correct) when loaded airflow durations were shorter than unloaded inspirations [trials in which both loads induced equal line pressure (and therefore limb muscle tension) waveforms]. Supplemental audio feedback related to instantaneous airflow (an expression of movement) improved load perception in breathers (to 64.2 +/- 3.0% correct; P < 0.01), indicating that airflow feedback introduced load-specific information that was lacking during breathing but redundant during pulling. In support of this hypothesis, airflow feedback by itself enabled a third group of listeners to identify load type with equal accuracy as pullers but with greater accuracy than breathers. These findings suggest that 1) uniformed subjects rely heavily on feedback from airway pressure and/or muscle tension receptors to perceive added loads to breathing and 2) limb mechanoreceptors provide a more sensitive appreciation of movement than do respiratory mechanoreceptors.",1994,76,1,14-25,10.1152/jappl.1994.76.1.14,#3641,Axen 1994,
957,22673641.0,"Office work and complaints of the arms, neck and shoulders: the role of job characteristics, muscular tension and need for recovery.",J Occup Health,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated physical, psychological and social job characteristics as potential risk factors for complaints of the arms, neck and shoulders (CANS) and mediating effects of muscular tension and need for recovery. METHODS: Data were collected among 105 computer workers using questionnaires and electromyography (EMG), and were analyzed with linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Task interdependence, information processing and lower social support predicted more CANS. Physical job demands had no predictive power over and above psychological and social Stressors. Both muscular tension and need for recovery partially mediated the job characteristics-CANS relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational health professionals should not neglect psychological and social job characteristics as potentially important predictors of CANS in specific occupational groups, such as office workers. Our findings imply that CANS interventions should not be restricted to ergonomic improvements, but should be accompanied by improvement of the job design from a psychological and social perspective and reactive intervention aimed at decreasing short-term physical strain (muscular tension) and mental strain (need for recovery).",2012,54,4,323-30,10.1539/joh.11-0152-oa,#3642,Gawke 2012,

This study extends recent work as it evaluates investigating the impact of social support and life satisfaction on adherence to voice therapy for MTD. METHOD: A cross-sectional study of 45 individuals diagnosed with MTD who participated in voice therapy between January 2014 and December 2015 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Science's Voice and Swallowing Center in Little Rock, Arkansas participated in this study. Participants provided information regarding employment status and completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Quality of Relationships Inventory. RESULT: Sixty percent of participants completed voice therapy. Patients who completed voice therapy were more likely to report gainful employment (P = 0.038) or less confidence in a specific and significant personal relationship (P = 0.004).

959,20389245.0,Differential diagnosis of muscle tension dysphonia and spasmodic dysphonia.,Curr Opin Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) can mimic the voice features of adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) leading to diagnostic confusion. Researchers have begun to compare characteristics of MTD and ADSD to determine whether there are markers which reliably distinguish the two disorders and lead to improved differential diagnosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Differences between MTD and ADSD have been identified during fiberoptic laryngoscopy, phonatory airflow measurement, acoustic analysis, and variable sign expression based upon phonatory task. In general, evidence of task-dependent sign expression and intraword phonatory breaks should raise suspicion of ADSD over MTD. However, on the basis of conventional standards of diagnostic precision, no single diagnostic test currently exists that reliably distinguishes the two disorders. SUMMARY: Although perceptual voice evaluation remains the standard for differential diagnosis of ADSD and MTD, knowledge of factors that influence the severity of sign expression in ADSD is important to differential diagnosis. During clinical assessment, voice clinicians who use generic stimulus materials that do not control for specific phonetic environments or voice tasks may miss critical phenomenological features of ADSD.",2010,18,3,165-70,10.1097/MOO.0b013e328339376c,#3644,Roy 2010,

Analyses were performed on 60 women and 155 men with no angina but medical perfusion imaging evidence of ischemia during exercise. MEASURES: The presence of various non-pain-related symptoms. Ischemia is indicated by myocardial perfusion defects on exercise stress testing with single photon emission computed tomography. RESULTS: Women reported more nonangina symptoms than men (P<0.05). They experienced fatigue, hot flushes, tense muscles, shortness of breath and headaches more frequently (P<0.05). Symptoms relating to muscle tension and diaphoresis were associated with ischemia after controlling for pertinent clinical covariates. However, the direction of association differed according to sex and history of coronary artery disease events or procedures.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were performed on isolated human renal arteries rings obtained during surgery due to kidney tumors (n = 12). Epinine concentration-dependently relaxed isolated precontracted (PGF2 alpha) human renal artery rings (P < 0.05) in the presence of phentolamine, as effectively (epinine -30 +/- 4 mN, dopamine -31 +/- 5 mN) and with the same potency as dopamine (epinine EC50 0.7 mumol/l (0.4-1.2 mumol/l), dopamine 0.5 mumol/l (0.2-1.7 mumol/l). This effect was antagonized by the specific D1-receptor-antagonist SCH 23390. Effective beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic concentrations of propranolol did not affect epinine-induced vasorelaxation. In the absence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-antagonists the potency of epinine to contract renal artery rings was significantly higher compared to dopamine indicating a higher affinity of epinine to alpha-adrenoceptors.

Seven Greyhound and six mongrel dogs were given halothane and succinylcholine anesthesia as a challenge to trigger MH. They also underwent semitendinosus muscle biopsy for contracture study with halothane and caffeine. Measurements in vivo of mixed venous and arterial blood gases, cardiac output by thermodilution, temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate provided sequential data regarding whole body O2 consumption (product of cardiac output and arterial-mixed venous O2 content difference), acid-base status, and arterial CO2 tension. Greyhounds and mongrels had uniformly similar in vivo and in vitro responses, without evidence for MH. Contracture thresholds were higher than those reported for normal swine and humans (8 mM vs. 4 mM). Information on MH susceptibility in this breed is important for laboratory investigation in Greyhounds as well as to veterinary medicine in general. Neither mongrels nor this group of Greyhounds were obviously susceptible to MH. If all Greyhounds are genetically homologous, then Greyhounds may not be specifically MH susceptible.

970,26471759.0,Caffeine and contraction synergistically stimulate 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase and insulin-independent glucose transport in rat skeletal muscle.,Physiol Rep,"5'-Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been identified as a key mediator of contraction-stimulated insulin-independent glucose transport in skeletal muscle. Caffeine acutely stimulates AMPK in resting skeletal muscle, but it is unknown whether caffeine affects AMPK in contracting muscle. Isolated rat epitrochlearis muscle was preincubated and then incubated in the absence or presence of 3 mmol/L caffeine for 30 or 120 min. Electrical stimulation (ES) was used to evoke tetanic contractions during the last 10 min of the incubation period. The combination of caffeine plus contraction had additive effects on AMPKα Thr(172) phosphorylation, α-isoform-specific AMPK activity, and 3-O-methylglucose (3MG) transport. In contrast, caffeine inhibited basal and contraction-stimulated Akt Ser(473) phosphorylation. Caffeine significantly delayed muscle fatigue during contraction, and the combination of caffeine and contraction additively decreased ATP and phosphocreatine contents. Caffeine did not affect resting tension. Next, rats were given an intraperitoneal injection of caffeine (60 mg/kg body weight) or saline, and the extensor digitorum longus muscle was dissected 15 min later. ES of the sciatic nerve was performed to evoke tetanic contractions for 5 min before dissection. Similar to the findings from isolated muscles incubated in vitro, the combination of caffeine plus contraction in vivo had additive effects on AMPK phosphorylation, AMPK activity, and 3MG transport. Caffeine also inhibited basal and contraction-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in vivo. These findings suggest that caffeine and contraction synergistically stimulate AMPK activity and insulin-independent glucose transport, at least in part by decreasing muscle fatigue and thereby promoting energy consumption during contraction.",2015,3,10,,10.14814/phy2.12592,#3655,Tsuda 2015,5â²âAMPâactivated protein kinase
971,19876643.0,"Hypoxia stimulates lactate release and modulates monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4) expression in human adipocytes.",Pflugers Arch,"Hypoxia modulates white adipose tissue function, and this includes stimulating glucose uptake and the expression of facilitative glucose transporters (particularly GLUT1) in adipocytes. This study has examined the effect of hypoxia on lactate release from adipocytes and whether the monocarboxylate transporters that mediate lactate transport (MCTs1-4) are expressed in human adipocytes and are induced by low O(2) tension. Exposure of human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome adipocytes to 1% O(2) for 24 h resulted in increased lactate release (2.3-fold) compared with cells in normoxia (21% O(2)). Screening by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that the genes encoding MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 are expressed in human adipose tissue, and in adipocytes and preadipocytes in culture. Hypoxia (48 h) increased MCT1 (8.5-fold) and MCT4 (14.3-fold) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in human adipocytes, but decreased MCT2 mRNA (fourfold). MCT1 protein level was also increased (2.7-fold at 48 h) by hypoxia, but there was no change in MCT4 protein. The changes in MCT gene expression induced by hypoxia were reversed on return to normoxia. Treatment with the hypoxia mimetic CoCl(2) resulted in up-regulation of MCT1 (up to twofold) and MCT4 (fivefold) mRNA level, but there was no significant effect on MCT2 expression. It is concluded that hypoxia increases lactate release from adipocytes and modulates MCT expression in a type-specific manner, with MCT1 and MCT4 expression being hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1) dependent. Increased lactate production and monocarboxylate transporter expression are likely to be key components of the adaptive response of adipocytes to low O(2) tension as adipose tissue mass expands in obesity.",2010,459,3,509-18,10.1007/s00424-009-0750-3,#3656,PÃ©rezdeHeredia 2010,
972,34892298.0,Femur Abduction Associated with Transfemoral Amputation Alters the Profile of Lumbopelvic Mechanical Loads During Generalized End-Limb Loading.,Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,"Pain in the lower back is frequent problem for most individuals with transfemoral amputation, which limits their overall mobility and quality of life. While the underlying root causes of back pain are multifactorial, a contributing factor is the mechanical loading environment within the lumbopelvic joint. Specifically, this study aims to explore the upstream effects amputation has on the mechanical loading environment of the lumbopelvic joint using a 3D musculoskeletal model of transfemoral amputation. A generic musculoskeletal model was altered to represent a transfemoral amputation. Muscle parameters were adjusted to represent a myodesis amputation surgery that preserved musculotendon tension in a neutral anatomical pose. The model contained a total of 28 degrees of freedom and 76 muscles spanning the lower-limb and torso. In forward dynamics simulations, generalized external forces were applied to the distal end of the residual limb at a series of directions. Axial, oblique and transverse 10 N end-limb loads were applied. In addition, simulations were performed for 0°, 4°, and 8° of femur abduction, which are clinically observed in individuals with transfemoral amputation. In these simulations, reaction forces and moments at the lumbopelvic joint were computed. In general, femur abduction had little effect on back loading for an axial applied end-limb force. These data showed that while the individual magnitudes of lumbopelvic force and moment reactions did not significantly deviate for differing levels of femur abduction, the pattern of how these forces changes in response to different end-limb force directions (applied circumferentially along the limb) was affected by femur abduction angle.Clinical Relevance- The changes in joint reaction forces in the lumbopelvic joint from an aligned position to an abducted position reinforce the importance of avoiding hip flexion-abduction contracture during amputation surgery. This suggests that surgical techniques such as myodesis, osseointegration, or medial thighplasty, which intend to maintain anatomical alignment may have beneficial upstream effects for the patients during locomotion. Given the prevalence of lower back pain in individuals with transfemoral amputation, teasing out the causes of lower back pain could bring relief to a population that struggles with community independence.",2021,2021,,4863-4866,10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630149,#3657,Jones 2021,
973,7681624.0,Hypoxia induces lymphocyte adhesion to human mesenchymal cells via an LFA-1-dependent mechanism.,Am J Physiol,"We and others have previously reported that mesenchymal cells, including endothelial and muscle cells, sense oxygen tension and respond in a specific way during exposure to hypoxic environment. We have examined the interactions of human muscle and endothelial cells, which have been exposed to hypoxic environments, with T and B lymphoid cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), not subjected to hypoxia. The adhesion of B lymphocyte cell line (JY) and the adhesion of T lymphocyte cell line (Jurkat) to muscle cell monolayers that had been incubated at PO2 of 50 Torr for 3 h increased more than four- and twofold, respectively. Hypoxia appears to upregulate a saturable muscle cell-associated adhesion mechanism, which is capable of withstanding distraction forces greater than 45 g, and is inhibitable by LFA-1-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Hypoxia also induced a reciprocal decrease in lymphocyte-muscle cell adhesion mechanisms inhibitable by VCAM-1- or VLA-4-specific MAbs. Cultured human endothelial cells when subjected to hypoxic conditions also increased their adhesion for lymphoid cells and cell lines. This induction of adhesion could again be attenuated by anti-LFA-1, but not by anti-ICAM-1 MAb, suggesting that hypoxia activates an adhesion molecule on human mesenchymal cells that is likely to be a new ligand for LFA-1.

976,24993589.0,Acromioclavicular joint dislocations: radiological correlation between Rockwood classification system and injury patterns in human cadaver species.,Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,"INTRODUCTION: The classification system of Rockwood and Young is a commonly used classification for acromioclavicular joint separations subdividing types I-VI. This classification hypothesizes specific lesions to anatomical structures (acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments, capsule, attached muscles) leading to the injury. In recent literature, our understanding for anatomical correlates leading to the radiological-based Rockwood classification is questioned. The goal of this experimental-based investigation was to approve the correlation between the anatomical injury pattern and the Rockwood classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In four human cadavers (seven shoulders), the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments were transected stepwise. Radiological correlates were recorded (Zanca view) with 15-kg longitudinal tension applied at the wrist. The resulting acromio- and coracoclavicular distances were measured. RESULTS: Radiographs after acromioclavicular ligament transection showed joint space enlargement (8.6 ± 0.3 vs. 3.1 ± 0.5 mm, p < 0.05) and no significant change in coracoclavicular distance (10.4 ± 0.9 vs. 10.0 ± 0.8 mm). According to the Rockwood classification only type I and II lesions occurred. After additional coracoclavicular ligament cut, the acromioclavicular joint space width increased to 16.7 ± 2.7 vs. 8.6 ± 0.3 mm, p < 0.05. The mean coracoclavicular distance increased to 20.6 ± 2.1 mm resulting in type III-V lesions concerning the Rockwood classification. CONCLUSIONS: Trauma with intact coracoclavicular ligaments did not result in acromioclavicular joint lesions higher than Rockwood type I and II. The clinical consequence for reconstruction of low-grade injuries might be a solely surgical approach for the acromioclavicular ligaments or conservative treatment. High-grade injuries were always based on additional structural damage to the coracoclavicular ligaments. Rockwood type V lesions occurred while muscle attachments were intact.",2014,134,9,1193-8,10.1007/s00402-014-2045-1,#3661,Eschler 2014,

The generic geometries are a subset from the model database of the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) (http://www.physiome.org.nz) Physiome Project with soft tissue derived from the widely used visible human dataset, and the bones digitised from an anatomically accurate physical model with muscle attachment information. The models are customised to patient magnetic resonance images using a variant of free-form deformation, called 'host-mesh' fitting. The continuum was solved using the governing equation of finite elasticity, with the multibody problem coupled through contact mechanics. Additional constraints such as tissue incompressibility are also imposed. Passive material properties are taken from the literature and implemented for deformable tissue with a non-linear micro-structurally based constitutive law. Bone and cartilage are implemented using a 'St-Venant Kirchoff' model suitable for rigid body rotations. The surface fibre directions have been estimated from anatomy images of cadaver muscle dissections and active muscle contraction was based on a steady-state calcium-tension relation. The 3D continuum model of muscle, tendon and bone is compared with experimental results from the literature, and surgical simulations performed to illustrate its clinical assessment capabilities (a Maquet procedure for reducing patella stresses and a vastus lateralis release for a bipartite patella).

R(os), ventilation, cardiovascular activity, and skin conductance were measured continuously. R(os) was higher during emotional compared to neutral films, particularly during BII material, and responses increased from healthy over asthmatic to BII phobia participants.

However, many details about cytoskeletal tension remain poorly understood because these forces cannot be directly measured in living cells. Therefore, we have developed a method to characterize the magnitude and distribution of pre-extension of actin stress fibers (SFs) due to resting tension in the cytoskeleton. Using a custom apparatus, human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were cultured on a pre-stretched silicone substrate coated with a fibronectin-like polymer. Release of the substrate caused SFs aligned in the shortening direction in adhered cells to buckle when compressed rapidly (5% shortening per second or greater) beyond their unloaded slack length. Subsequently, the actin cytoskeleton completely disassembled in 5 sec and reassembled within 60 sec. Quantification of buckling in digital fluorescent micrographs of cells fixed and stained with rhodamine phalloidin indicated a nonuniform distribution of 0-26% pre-extension of SFs in non-locomoting HAECs. Local variability suggests heterogeneity of cytoskeletal tension and/or stiffness within individual cells. These findings provide new information about the magnitude and distribution of cytoskeletal tension and the dynamics of actin stress fibers, and the approach offers a novel method to elucidate the role of specific cytoskeletal elements and crosslinking proteins in the force generating apparatus of non-muscle cells.",2002,52,4,266-74,10.1002/cm.10056,#3664,Costa 2002,

The remarkable therapeutic utility of botulinum toxin lies in its ability to specifically and potently inhibit involuntary muscle activity for an extended duration. The clostridia produce more protein toxins than any other bacterial genus and are a rich reservoir of toxins for research and medicinal uses. Research is underway to use clostridial toxins or toxin domains for drug delivery, prevention of food poisoning, and the treatment of cancer and other diseases. The remarkable success of botulinum toxin as a therapeutic agent has created a new field of investigation in microbiology.",1999,53,,551-75,10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.551,#3665,Johnson 1999,
981,18495134.0,Internal mechanical conditions in the soft tissues of a residual limb of a trans-tibial amputee.,J Biomech,"Most trans-tibial amputation (TTA) patients use a prosthesis to retain upright mobility capabilities. Unfortunately, interaction between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket causes elevated internal strains and stresses in the muscle and fat tissues in the residual limb, which may lead to deep tissue injury (DTI) and other complications. Presently, there is paucity of information on the mechanical conditions in the TTA residual limb during load-bearing. Accordingly, our aim was to characterize the mechanical conditions in the muscle flap of the residual limb of a TTA patient after donning the prosthetic socket and during load-bearing. Knowledge of internal mechanical conditions in the muscle flap can be used to identify the risk for DTI and improve the fitting of the prosthesis. We used a patient-specific modelling approach which involved an MRI scan, interface pressure measurements between the residual limb and the socket of the prosthesis and three-dimensional non-linear large-deformation finite-element (FE) modelling to quantify internal soft tissue strains and stresses in a female TTA patient during static load-bearing. Movement of the truncated tibia and fibula during load-bearing was measured by means of MRI and used as displacement boundary conditions for the FE model. Subsequently, we calculated the internal strains, strain energy density (SED) and stresses in the muscle flap under the truncated bones. Internal strains under the tibia peaked at 85%, 129% and 106% for compression, tension and shear strains, respectively. Internal strains under the fibula peaked at substantially lower values, that is, 19%, 22% and 19% for compression, tension and shear strains, respectively. Strain energy density peaked at the tibial end (104kJ/m(3)). The von Mises stresses peaked at 215kPa around the distal end of the tibia. Stresses under the fibula were at least one order of magnitude lower than the stresses under the tibia. We surmise that our present patient-specific modelling method is an important tool in understanding the etiology of DTI in the residual limbs of TTA patients.",2008,41,9,1897-909,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2008.03.035,#3666,Portnoy 2008,
982,33188985.0,Caveolae: Mechanosensing and mechanotransduction devices linking membrane trafficking to mechanoadaptation.,Curr Opin Cell Biol,"Mechanical forces (extracellular matrix stiffness, vascular shear stress, and muscle stretching) reaching the plasma membrane (PM) determine cell behavior. Caveolae are PM-invaginated nanodomains with specific lipid and protein composition. Being highly abundant in mechanically challenged tissues (muscles, lungs, vessels, and adipose tissues), they protect cells from mechanical stress damage. Caveolae flatten upon increased PM tension, enabling both force sensing and accommodation, critical for cell mechanoprotection and homeostasis. Thus, caveolae are highly plastic, ranging in complexity from flattened membranes to vacuolar invaginations surrounded by caveolae-rosettes-which also contribute to mechanoprotection. Caveolar components crosstalk with mechanotransduction pathways and recent studies show that they translocate from the PM to the nucleus to convey stress information. Furthermore, caveolae components can regulate membrane traffic from/to the PM to adapt to environmental mechanical forces. The interdependence between lipids and caveolae starts to be understood, and the relevance of caveolae-dependent membrane trafficking linked to mechanoadaption to different physiopathological processes is emerging.",2021,68,,113-123,10.1016/j.ceb.2020.10.008,#3667,DelPozo 2021,
983,11061943.0,Possible role of human growth hormone in penile erection.,J Urol,"PURPOSE: Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency increases nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). We examined the functional in vitro effects of recombinant human growth hormone on tissue tension and cyclic nucleotide levels of human corpus cavernosum and detected changes in growth hormone in the cavernous and peripheral blood during different phases of penile erection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relaxant responses of human corpus cavernosum were investigated using the organ bath technique. Tissue levels of cGMP were determined by a specific radioimmunoassay after dose dependent exposition of isolated human corpus cavernosum strips to recombinant human growth hormone. In 35 healthy potent volunteers blood samples were obtained simultaneously from the corpus cavernosum and cubital vein during different functional conditions of the penis, including flaccidity, tumescence, rigidity and detumescence. Penile erection was induced by audiovisual and tactile stimulation. Serum growth hormone was determined by an immunoradiometric assay. RESULTS: Recombinant human growth hormone elicited dose dependent relaxation of human corpus cavernosum strips in vitro. The relaxing potency of recombinant human growth hormone was paralleled by its ability to elevate intracellular levels of cGMP. In vivo the peripheral growth hormone serum profile of the respective penile conditions did not significantly differ from those of cavernous serum. The main increase in growth hormone to greater than 90% was determined during developing penile tumescence, followed by a transient decrease afterward. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that penile erection may probably be induced by growth hormone through its cGMP stimulating activity on human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle.",2000,164,6,2138-42,,#3668,Becker 2000,

METHODS: Specimens of penile urethra were obtained from male patients who had undergone male-to-female gender reassignment surgery. Using the tissue bath technique, the contraction induced by increasing concentrations (1 nM-10 μM) of norepinephrine, phenylephrine, acetylcholine, carbachol, prostaglandin F2α, endothelin 1, angiotensin II, and oxytocin was measured. In another set-up, the effects of C-type natriuretic peptide (0.1 nM-1 μM), sodium nitroprusside, sildenafil, forskolin, alpha2-antagonist delquamine, and acetylcholine (1 nM/10 nM-10 μM) on the tension induced by norepinephrine were investigated. The production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) was measured by means of specific radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: Endothelin 1, oxytocin, prostaglandin F2α, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine induced dose-dependent contraction of the isolated urethral tissue, whereas acetylcholine, carbachol, and angiotensin II had no or only minor contractile effects. The contraction induced by norepinephrine was reversed by the drugs with the following rank order of efficacy: sodium nitroprusside > delquamine > sildenafil > C-type natriuretic peptide > forskolin > acetylcholine. The maximal reversion of tension ranged from 68% (sodium nitroprusside) to 22% (acetylcholine). The relaxing effects of the drugs were paralleled by a several-fold increase in tissue levels of cyclic GMP and cyclic adenosine monophosphate. CONCLUSION: The results provide evidence that urethral smooth muscle is under the control of endogenous compounds, such as adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine and phenylephrine), vasoactive peptides, prostagladins, NO/cyclic GMP, and acetylcholine, assumed to influence micturition at the peripheral level.",2013,82,6,1451.e13-9,10.1016/j.urology.2013.08.023,#3669,Kedia 2013,
985,29355129.0,A scoping review on smart mobile devices and physical strain.,Work,"BACKGROUND: Smart mobile devices gain increasing importance at work. Integrating these smart mobile devices into the workplace creates new opportunities and challenges for occupational health and safety. OBJECTIVES: Therefore the aim of the following scoping review was to identify ergonomic challenges with the use of smart mobile devices at work with respect to physical problems. METHOD: A review of 36 papers based on literature including January 2016 was conducted. RESULTS: Biomechanical measures in the reviewed studies demonstrated i.e., head flexion angles exceeding 20° in 20 out of 26 different conditions described. Furthermore, laterally deviated wrists were frequently noted and thumb and finger flexor muscle activities generally greater than 5% MVC were reported. CONCLUSION: The reviewed literature indicated an elevated biomechanical risk, especially for the neck, the wrists and thumb. This was due to poor posture, ongoing and intermitted muscle tension, and/or repetitive movements. Papers addressing specific risks for smartphone and tablet use in different work environments are scarce. As the technology, as well as the use of smart mobile devices is rapidly changing, further research, especially for prolonged periods in the workplace is needed.",2018,59,2,273-283,10.3233/WOR-172678,#3670,Tegtmeier 2018,Posture
986,7557258.0,Comparison of the pharmacological response of human corpus cavernosal tissue with the response of rabbit cavernosal tissue.,Gen Pharmacol,"1. This study directly compares the response of cavernosal tissue obtained from sexually mature rabbits with the response of human corpus cavernosal tissue obtained during implant surgery for psychogenic impotence (five individual samples) to field stimulation and specific autonomic agonists. 2. At 2 g basal tension, field stimulation of the rabbit corpus cavernosal tissue produced a frequency dependent biphasic response consisting of an initial relaxation followed by contraction. Low frequency stimulation induced primarily relaxations whereas high frequency stimulation induced primarily contractions. FS of human corpus cavernosal tissue induced a frequency dependent contraction. 3. In general, the rabbit corpus cavernosal strips showed a significantly greater degree of spontaneous activity than the strips of human cavernosal tissue. 4. Phenylephrine stimulated a rapid and sustained increase in basal tension in both tissues. Although the isolated strips weighed the same, the magnitude of the response of the rabbit tissue was significantly greater than the response of the human tissue. 5. For both tissues, FS relaxations were completely inhibited by L-NAME showing that the relaxations were mediated by nitric oxide. Similarly, for both tissues, nitroprusside, ATP, and bethanechol induced similar dose-response relaxations of pre-stimulated tissue. 6. In conclusion, the major difference between the response of human and rabbit tissue to various forms of stimulation was that isolated strips of human corporal tissue responded to FS with contractions at all frequencies whereas the rabbit tissue responded to the relaxations at low frequencies of stimulation; a clear bi-phasic response at intermediate frequencies; and contraction at high frequencies.",1995,26,5,1107-11,10.1016/0306-3623(94)00260-t,#3671,Levin 1995,

Using freshly resected uvular tissues, passive and active uvular tissue-specific elastance and shortening were determined during stimulation of MU. No difference was found in maximum tetanic tension measured on uvular tissue between the two groups (47.2 +/- 14.8 g in SAHS and 39.1 +/- 16.5 g in snorers). Passive uvular-specific elastance was significantly less in snorers (0.36 +/- 0.27 g/% Lo) compared with patients with SAHS (0.84 +/- 0.39 g/% Lo) (p = 0.006). There was a negative correlation between uvular shortening and passive uvular specific elastance (r = 0.69, p = 0. 05). Maximal tetanic tension developed by isolated MU was higher in SAHS than in snorers (45.8 +/- 23.1 and 30.0 +/- 8.3 g, respectively, p = 0.04). A strong positive relationship was found between the apnea index and specific uvular elastance (r = 0.55, p = 0.007).

In this work the aponeurotic thoracolumbar fascia and the epymisial gluteal fascia of seven adult C57-BL mice were analysed by Transmission Electron Microscopy and floating immunohistochemistry with the aim to study the organization of nerve fibers, the presence of nerve corpuscles and the amount of autonomic innervation. The antibodies used were Anti-S100, Anti-Tyrosine Hydroxylase and Anti-PGP, specific for the Schwann cells forming myelin, the sympathetic nerve fibers, and the peripheral nerve fibers, respectively. The results showed that the fascial tissue is pervaded by a rhomboid and dense network of nerves. The innervation was statistically significantly lower in the gluteal fascia (2.78 ± 0.6% of positive area, 140.3 ± 31.6/mm(2) branching points, nerves with 3.2 ± 0.6 mm length and 4.9 ± 0.2 µm thickness) with respect to the thoracolumbar fascia (9.01 ± 0.98% of innervated area, 500.9 ± 43.1 branching points/mm(2), length of 87.1 ± 1.0 mm, thickness of 5.8 ± 0.2 µm). Both fasciae revealed the same density of autonomic nerve fibers (0.08%). Lastly, corpuscles were not found in thoracolumbar fascia. Based on these results, it is suggested that the two fasciae have different roles in proprioception and pain perception: the free nerve endings inside thoracolumbar fascia may function as proprioceptors, regulating the tensions coming from associated muscles and having a role in nonspecific low back pain, whereas the epymisial fasciae works to coordinate the actions of the various motor units of the underlying muscle.",2021,11,1,12623,10.1038/s41598-021-92194-z,#3674,Fede 2021,

Neuronal activity was registered by microelectrode technique during 18 stereotactic neurosurgery operations in spasmodic torticollis patients. The presentation of functionally significant verbal stimuli was accompanied by the emergence of short-term (0.5-1.5 s) local synchronization and stabilization of the oscillatory (3-6 Hz) activity in nearby neurons of nonspecific (CM-Pf) thalamus. These focuses of synchronized oscillatory neuronal activity were correlated with the moment of the greatest concentration of selective attention. Similar phenomenon of short-term synchronization was observed in the motor (Voi) and nonspecific (CM-Pf) thalamus of the human brain during the voluntary movements. Synchronization of neuronal activity occurred at the height of the motor act implementation, correlating with the maximum muscle tension, as well as in aftereffect of the voluntary movement. Overall, the findings suggest an important role of the local oscillations (3-6 Hz) and synchronization ofthalamic neurons in the mechanisms of relevant information transmission during goal-directed human behavior.",2014,40,1,12-May,,#3675,Sedov 2014,
991,28510118.0,Tampering with springs: phosphorylation of titin affecting the mechanical function of cardiomyocytes.,Biophys Rev,"Reversible post-translational modifications of various cardiac proteins regulate the mechanical properties of the cardiomyocytes and thus modulate the contractile performance of the heart. The giant protein titin forms a continuous filament network in the sarcomeres of striated muscle cells, where it determines passive tension development and modulates active contraction. These mechanical properties of titin are altered through post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation. Titin contains hundreds of potential phosphorylation sites, the functional relevance of which is only beginning to emerge. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art summary of the phosphorylation sites in titin, with a particular focus on the elastic titin spring segment. We discuss how phosphorylation at specific amino acids can reduce or increase the stretch-induced spring force of titin, depending on where the spring region is phosphorylated. We also review which protein kinases phosphorylate titin and how this phosphorylation affects titin-based passive tension in cardiomyocytes. A comprehensive overview is provided of studies that have measured altered titin phosphorylation and titin-based passive tension in myocardial samples from human heart failure patients and animal models of heart disease. As our understanding of the broader implications of phosphorylation in titin progresses, this knowledge could be used to design targeted interventions aimed at reducing pathologically increased titin stiffness in patients with stiff hearts.",2017,9,3,225-237,10.1007/s12551-017-0263-9,#3676,Hamdani 2017,Cardiomyocytes

However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms by which estrogens control human DSM excitability and contractility are not well known. Here, we used human DSM specimens from open bladder surgeries on 27 patients to elucidate the mechanism by which 17β-estradiol regulates large conductance voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels, the most prominent K(+) channels in human DSM We employed single BK channel recordings on inside-out excised membrane patches, perforated whole-cell patch-clamp on freshly isolated DSM cells, and isometric tension recordings on DSM-isolated strips to investigate the mechanism by which 17β-estradiol activates BK channels. 17β-Estradiol (100 nmol/L) rapidly increased depolarization-induced whole-cell K(+) currents in DSM cells. The 17β-estradiol stimulatory effects on whole-cell BK currents were completely abolished by the selective BK channel inhibitor paxilline (1 μmol/L), clearly indicating that 17β-estradiol specifically activates BK channels. 17β-Estradiol also increased the frequency of ryanodine receptor-mediated transient BK currents. Single BK channel recordings showed that 17β-estradiol (100 nmol/L) significantly increased the BK channel open probability of inside-out excised membrane patches, revealing that 17β-estradiol activates BK channels directly. 17β-Estradiol reduced spontaneous phasic contractions of human DSM-isolated strips in a concentration-dependent manner (100 nmol/L-1 μmol/L), and this effect was blocked by paxilline (1 μmol/L). 17β-Estradiol (100 nmol/L) also reduced nerve-evoked contractions of human DSM-isolated strips. Collectively, our results reveal that 17β-estradiol plays a critical role in regulating human DSM function through a direct nongenomic activation of BK channels.",2017,5,14,,10.14814/phy2.13351,#3677,Hristov 2017,17Î²âestradiol
993,22775307.0,Visceral and somatic disorders: tissue softening with frequency-specific microcurrent.,J Altern Complement Med,"Frequency-specific microcurrent (FSM) is an emerging technique for treating many health conditions. Pairs of frequencies of microampere-level electrical stimulation are applied to particular places on the skin of a patient via combinations of conductive graphite gloves, moistened towels, or gel electrode patches. A consistent finding is a profound and palpable tissue softening and warming within seconds of applying frequencies appropriate for treating particular conditions. Similar phenomena are often observed with successful acupuncture, cranial-sacral, and other energy-based techniques. This article explores possible mechanisms involved in tissue softening. In the 1970s, neuroscientist and osteopathic researcher Irvin Korr developed a ""γ-loop hypothesis"" to explain the persistence of increased systemic muscle tone associated with various somatic dysfunctions. This article summarizes how physiologists, neuroscientists, osteopaths, chiropractors, and fascial researchers have expanded on Korr's ideas by exploring various mechanisms by which injury or disease increase local muscle tension or systemic muscle tone. Following on Korr's hypothesis, it is suggested that most patients actually present with elevated muscle tone or tense areas due to prior traumas or other disorders, and that tissue softening indicates that FSM or other methods are affecting the cause of their pathophysiology.

Coronary artery smooth muscle cells are the main resident cells in the tunica media of arteries. In this work, we examined the behavior and differentiation state of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) when cultured on 3D polyurethane scaffolds to fabricate hybrid vascular tissues. As the mechanical strength of the scaffold is an important element in engineered hybrid vascular substitutes, porous 3D polyurethane scaffolds fabricated using paraffin spheres and ammonium chloride particles were tested for their mechanical properties both in tension and in compression. The use of ammonium chloride particles as porogen generated scaffolds with superior mechanical properties, which are suitable for vascular tissue engineering. When seeded on uncoated, fibronectin-coated, and Matrigel-coated scaffolds, HCASMCs were well spread and started producing collagen as judged by histochemical analysis but appeared to lack elastin production. Fibronectin coating appeared to promote the infiltration of HCASMCs into the scaffold better than Matrigel coating but did not appear to affect the expression of collagen and elastin. Western blot analyses after successful cell recovery from the scaffolds indicated that HCASMCs, after culturing for 4 and 7 days, expressed similar amounts of smooth muscle alpha-actin and calponin regardless of extracellular matrix coating. Taken together, our data showed that the behavior and differentiation phenotype of HCASMCs can be analyzed after culture in 3D polyurethane scaffolds to establish appropriate conditions that will favor the fabrication of hybrid-engineered vascular substitutes.",2009,15,10,3001-11,10.1089/ten.TEA.2009.0057,#3679,Grenier 2009,
995,11291820.0,Shoulder and neck complaints in customer relations: individual risk factors and perceived exposures at work.,Ergonomics,"Perceived psychosocial and biomechanical exposures, individual factors and pain in the shoulder and neck were recorded in two groups of female service workers (healthcare and shopping centre workers). The jobs investigated were characterized by 'much' direct human relations, 'little' sitting and 'much' standing, and were light work by physiological or biomechanical criteria but potentially psychosocially demanding. A screening survey (n = 400 females) was the basis for the selected sample (n = 66 females), which was the object of the main investigation of this study. Reliability of the questionnaires was tested in a separate group of female healthcare workers (n = 29). Heart rate recordings through the work day estimated workload. There was a high prevalence of shoulder and neck pain (> 50%) for both work groups. In the two populations it proved difficult to explain shoulder and neck pain by reported physical and psychosocial exposures or individual factors, except by the variable 'perceived general tension', which clearly differentiated workers with and without pain. The findings in this study indicated, first, that perceived general tension might be an independent risk factor for muscle pain and, second, that this might be related to personality factors. However, this putative relationship must be verified in a longitudinal study. As no variable describing exposures in the working environment was associated with shoulder and neck pain, the question is posed whether such complaints can be considered work-related. Alternatively, the variables used to describe mechanical and psychosocial exposures in this study may have low specificity in characterizing work-related risk factors for service workers with customer relations.",2001,44,4,355-72,10.1080/00140130010008101,#3680,Vasseljen 2001,
996,16292559.0,Cyclic AMP-specific and cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoenzymes in human cavernous arteries--immunohistochemical distribution and functional significance.,World J Urol,"OBJECTIVES: It has been well established that male erectile dysfunction is frequently associated with vascular diseases. The normal function of cavernous arteries is considered a prerequisite to maintain sufficient blood flow to the trabecular spaces in order to enable penile erection. Contractility of cavernous arteries is regulated by the peripheral autonomic nervous system and endogenous factors released from the endothelial cell layer. A significant increase of blood flow in the central cavernous arteries is the initial event leading to penile tumescence and rigidity. Besides the significance of the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-mediated mechanisms, the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signalling pathway is also involved in the regulation of tone of the erectile tissue, and interactions between cGMP- and cAMP-mediated mechanisms have been demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to investigate by means of immunohistochemistry the presence of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes 3, 4 (cAMP-specific PDEs) and 5 (cGMP-specific PDE) in thin sections of human central cavernous arteries (HCA) and their functional significance in the mechanism of vessel tone regulation. METHODS: Functional experiments were performed using circular segments of HCA and strip preparations of the human corpus cavernosum (HCC). Relaxant effects induced by the cumulative addition of the PDE inhibitors milrinone (PDE3 inhibitor), rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) and sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitor; 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 M) were studied in preparations of HCA and HCC challenged by 1 M norepinephrine (NE). Moreover, immunohistochemistry was carried out in order to evaluate the expression of PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5 in thin sections of HCA. RESULTS: Milrinone, rolipram and sildenafil dose-dependently reversed the NE-induced tension of the isolated vascular segments and HCC strips with sildenafil being the most effective drug. Neither rolipram nor milrinone reached an EC50 value. Abundant immunoreactivities specific for PDE3, PDE4 and PDE5 were observed in the entire smooth musculature of the wall of HCA and resistance arteries. In addition, immunoreactivity for PDE4 was also detected in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining the cavernous arteries. CONCLUSIONS: The cGMP-dependent relaxation of cavernous arteries is not only dependent on the normal function of the peripheral autonomic nervous system but also on the functional integrity of the vascular endothelium. The expression of the cGMP-specific PDE5 and the ability of the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil to reverse the adrenergic tension of isolated segments of HCA underline the important role of the NO/cGMP pathway in the control of smooth muscle tone of human trabecular smooth musculature and penile cavernous arteries. Our results also suggest a significance of the cAMP-dependent signaling mechanisms in the regulation of tension of central HCAs. The present findings are also in support of the hypothesis of interactions between the cGMP- and cAMP-mediated signaling pathways in HCAs. Further investigations are indicated in order to outline potential differences between central HCAs and helicine resistance arteries. This may help to understand better the relations between structural and functional changes in the penile erectile tissue in patients with cardiovascular diseases and endothelial dysfunction.",2005,23,6,405-10,10.1007/s00345-005-0026-2,#3681,Waldkirch 2005,

Drawing upon two recently published meta-analyses, data from 150 outcome studies, including randomized controlled trials as well as uncontrolled quasi-experimental designs, were screened. Of these, 94 studies were selected for inclusion according to predefined criteria. Meta-analytic integrations were carried out separately for the two conditions of interest. The main results were medium-to-large mean effect sizes for biofeedback in adult migraine and tension-type headache patients. Treatment effects remained stable over an average follow-up period of 14 months, both in completer and intention-to-treat analyses. Headache frequency was the primary outcome variable and showed the largest improvements. Further significant effects were shown for perceived self-efficacy, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and medication consumption. Reduced muscle tension in pain related areas was observed in electromyographic feedback for tension-type headache. Biofeedback was more effective than waiting list and headache monitoring conditions in all cases, while electromyographic feedback for tension-type headache showed additional significant effects over placebo and relaxation therapies.

998,3047201.0,Speculations on the structure/function relationship for vagal and splanchnic afferent endings supplying the gastrointestinal tract.,J Auton Nerv Syst,"This paper discusses some of the unsettled issues in the study of the afferent innervation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Afferent fibres in the vagus and splanchnic nerves have been studied electrophysiologically and much has been learnt from single fibre recordings. Splanchnic afferent fibres generally terminate in multiple mechanosensitive endings in the mesentery and serosa where they are in a position to monitor tension on the mesenteric attachments. Other mechanoreceptors following a mainly vagal pathway behave as if they are functionally in-series with the muscle elements of the gut wall and signal muscle tension generated passively by distension and actively during contraction. A third group of afferent endings supply the GI mucosa where they are in a position to signal information on the physical and chemical environment of the gut lumen. A complex picture of mucosal sensitivity has emerged with subpopulations of receptors with polymodal sensitivity and quality-specific mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors and chemoreceptors.

999,17901165.0,Reactive oxygen species are messengers in maintenance of human and guinea pig gallbladder tonic contraction.,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,"The tonic contraction of human and guinea pig gallbladder (GB) is dependent on basal levels of PGE(2) and thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)). The pathway involved in the genesis of these prostaglandins has not been elucidated. We aimed to examine the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and whether they contribute to the genesis of GB tonic contraction by generating basal prostaglandin levels. Tonic contraction was studied in human and guinea pig GB muscle strips treated with ROS scavengers (Tiron and catalase), apocynin (an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase), and NOX-1 small interference RNA (siRNA). The subunits of NADPH oxidase and their functional roles were determined with specific antibodies in GB muscle cells. ROS scavengers reduced the GB tonic contraction and H(2)O(2) and PGE(2) levels. Apocynin also inhibited the tonic contraction. Antibodies against subunits of NADPH oxidase present in GB muscle cells lowered H(2)O(2) and PGE(2) levels. NOX-1 siRNA transfection reduced the tonic contraction, NOX-1 expression, and levels of H(2)O(2) and PGE(2). Tiron and apocynin inhibited the expected increase in tension and H(2)O(2) levels induced by stretching of muscle strips. H(2)O(2) increased the levels of PGE(2) and TxA(2) by increasing platelet-activating factor-like lipids that phosphorylate p38 and cPLA(2) sequentially. H(2)O(2) generated by NADPH oxidase participates in a signal transduction pathway that maintains the GB tonic contraction by activating PAF, p38, and cPLA(2) to generate prostaglandins.",2007,293,6,G1244-51,10.1152/ajpgi.00206.2007,#3684,Cong 2007,

The goals of physical rehabilitation of persons suffering from osteochondrosis are to strengthen the muscles of the back, reduce the load on the intervertebral discs, improve blood circulation, restore a normal motor stereotype and, as a result, reduce pain. The use of means of motor rehabilitation is scientifically substantiated, the mechanisms of their effect on the functional state of the body have been studied, and the effectiveness of their use is beyond doubt. However, the lack of multidisciplinary programs, at the heart of rehabilitation measures specifically for elderly and senile people with osteochondrosis of the cervical and thoracic spine, in practice leads to the widespread use of drug and targeted therapy, involving the use of only drugs that reduce pain and muscle tension. The lack of an individual approach, group exercises for physical therapy, handing out to patients advertising brochures, schemes for physical therapy, without practicing exercises in practical classes, lead to negative consequences and relapses of diseases and a negative attitude of patients towards the discipline as a whole. In this regard, it is necessary to develop and introduce into practice various complexes of physiotherapy exercises for elderly and senile patients with osteochondrosis of the cervical and thoracic spine.",2022,35,1,126-133,,#3685,Bobunov 2022,cervical spine

Isolated muscle strips were mounted for isometric tension recording in superfusion organ baths. Sodium nitroprusside, an exogenous donor of NO, relaxed the strips in a concentration dependent manner. In the presence of atropine and guanethidine, transmural field stimulation produced tetrodotoxin sensitive relaxations, which were inhibited in a dose dependent and enantiomer specific manner by antagonists of NO synthase; completely by L-nitroarginine and partially by L-N-monomethyl arginine. The effect of these antagonists was reversed by L-arginine but not D-arginine. Oxyhaemoglobin, a scavenger of nitric oxide, also abolished the relaxations but methaemoglobin had no such effect. These results strongly suggest that NO is, or is very closely associated with, the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic neurotransmitter mediating neurogenic relaxation of the human internal anal sphincter.",1993,34,5,689-93,10.1136/gut.34.5.689,#3687,O'Kelly 1993,

NaHS in concentrations of 10-200 μM reduced the amplitude, tonic tension, and frequency of contractions of the preparations. Blockade of K(+) channels with a non-specific antagonist tetraethylammonium (10 mM) increased contraction amplitude in the stomach strip and jejunum segment. The effects of NaHS on all parameters of contractile activity of the stomach and jejunum were fully preserved against the background of tetraethylammonium application. These data suggest that H2S in physiologically relevant concentrations inhibited spontaneous contractile activity of smooth muscle cells in rat stomach and jejunum by reducing the amplitude and frequency of contractions and decreased tonic tension without affecting the function of voltage- and calcium-dependent K(+) channels.",2014,157,3,302-6,10.1007/s10517-014-2551-8,#3688,Shafigullin 2014,

Low-cost nonpharmacological treatments are usually the first choice of professionals and parents. This study examined the outcomes of specific strength training for girls with TTH. METHODS: Forty-nine girls aged 9-18 years with TTH were randomized to patient education programs with 10 weeks of strength training and compared with those who were counseled by a nurse and physical therapist. Primary outcomes were headache frequency, intensity, and duration; secondary outcomes were neck-shoulder muscle strength, aerobic power, and pericranial tenderness, measured at baseline, after 10 weeks intervention, and at 12 weeks follow-up. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaires were assessed at baseline and after 24 months. RESULTS: For both groups, headache frequency decreased significantly, P=0.001, as did duration, P=0.022, with no significant between-group differences. The odds of having headache on a random day decreased over the 22 weeks by 0.65 (0.50-0.84) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]). For both groups, neck extension strength decreased significantly with a decrease in cervicothoracic extension/flexion ratio to 1.7, indicating a positive change in muscle balance. In the training group, shoulder strength increased $10% in 5/20 girls and predicted [Formula: see text] increased $15% for 4/20 girls. In the training group, 50% of girls with a headache reduction of $30% had an increase in [Formula: see text] >5%. For the counseling group, this was the case for 29%. A 24-month follow-up on HRQOL for the pooled sample revealed statistically significant improvements. Fifty-five percent of the girls reported little to none disability. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that both physical health and HRQOL can be influenced significantly by physical exercise and nurse counseling. More research is needed to examine the relationship between physical exercise, [Formula: see text], and TTH in girls.

METHODS: Fifty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: a control group, a Zusanli group, a non-point group, a Taichong group and a Neiguan group. Rats were anesthetized after 18 h of fasting, and a rat model of nociceptive blood pressure elevation and abnormal electrogastrogram (EGG) and gastric tension (GT) was prepared by gasbag-induced CRD. EA was given bilaterally, and its effects on gastric blood flow (GBF) of the arcus vasculosi of the greater omentum, blood pressure, EGG fast wave properties, and gastric smooth muscle tension (GT) were quantified. RESULTS: CRD induced an increase in blood pressure that was significantly inhibited by EA at all points (all P < 0.05), and the inhibitory effects were greater in the Zusanli and Neiguan groups compared to the non-point group (both P < 0.05). CRD also caused reductions in GT and GBF, and in the amplitude, frequency and duration of EGG waves (all P < 0.05). These effects were also reversed by EA. The effects of EA on EGG wave amplitude, GT, and GBF were superior in the Zusanli group compared to the Taichong group, Neiguan group, and the non-point group.

1006,10027074.0,Endothelial cell responses to hypoxic stress.,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,"1. Changes in the environmental oxygen tension to which cells are exposed in vivo result in physiological and sometimes pathological consequences that are associated with differential expression of specific genes. 2. Low oxygen tension (hypoxia) affects endothelial cellular physiology in vivo and in vitro in a number of ways, including the transcriptionally regulated expression of vasoactive substances and matrix proteins involved in modulating vascular tone or remodelling the vasculature and surrounding tissue. 3. Hypoxia results in the transcriptional induction of genes encoding vasoconstrictors and smooth muscle mitogens (PDGF-B, endothelin-1, VEGF, thrombospondin-1) and genes encoding matrix or remodelling molecules (collagenase IV (MMP-9), thrombospondin-1) and reciprocal transcriptional inhibition of vasodilatory or anti-mitogenic effectors (eNOS). 4. Oxygen appears to signal through a novel haem-containing sensor and signals initiated by this sensor alter the levels and DNA-binding activity of transcription factors such as activating protein (AP)-1, nuclear factor-kappa B and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1. 5. The genes encoding vasoactive factors regulated by oxygen tension are themselves also regulated by the vasoactive agent nitric oxide (NO). 6. Nitric oxide and oxygen transduce similar signals (i.e. their absence results in identical patterns of gene expression in endothelial cells and other cell types). 7. Thus, NO can feedback on and modulate signals induced by hypoxia and vice versa. For example, NO, which can act directly on smooth muscle cells as a vasodilator, can also facilitate vasodilation indirectly by reversing the production of vasoconstrictors induced by hypoxia. 8. Short-term exposure of endothelial cells to low oxygen tension results in the elaboration of predominantly vasoconstricting effectors, while longer-term and more severe hypoxic exposure generates factors that can induce smooth muscle proliferation and remodelling. 9. Thus, the endothelial cell response to hypoxic stress can result in two different consequences in the surrounding tissues, depending on the duration of the exposure: short-term exposure causes physiological and reversible modulation of vascular tone and blood flow; chronic hypoxic stress results in irreversible remodelling of the vasculature and surrounding tissues, with smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. 10. This dichotomy of responses to hypoxia may explain, in part, both the acute and chronic pathophysiological sequelae of diseases characterized by regional hypoxia, including atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, sickle cell disease and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).",1999,26,1,74-84,10.1046/j.1440-1681.1999.02992.x,#3691,Faller 1999,

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective, longitudinal, single-blinded, cross-sectional study. METHODS: Patients (n = 70) with a single voice disorder diagnosis of benign vocal fold lesions (lesions), unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP), primary muscle tension dysphonia (MTD-1), or vocal fold atrophy (atrophy) underwent baseline testing, a single intervention (phonosurgery or voice therapy), and follow-up testing. Common aerodynamic measurements were completed in repeated syllables and an all-voiced sentence. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were observed for two outcome measures, average airflow in syllables, and average airflow in the all-voiced sentence. Patients with lesions, UVFP, and MTD-1 improved in average airflow in the all-voiced sentence. Patients with UVFP also improved in airflow in syllables. CONCLUSIONS: Average airflow in the all-voiced sentence changed as a function of treatment for the lesion, MTD-1, and UVFP groups, demonstrating a disorder-specific pattern. Laryngeal airway resistance, and estimates of average subglottal pressure did not show significant change. Average airflow in the all-voiced sentence measurements is recommended as a routine voice measure, and further investigation of other aerodynamic measures' sensitivity to change is warranted.",2016,30,3,301-7,10.1016/j.jvoice.2015.03.017,#3692,Dastolfo 2016,Aerodynamic

METHODS: Using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, the expression and distribution in the prostate of cAKIalpha, cAKIbeta, cAKIIalpha, and cAKIIbeta in relation to alpha-actin and the phosphodiesterase PDE4 (types A and B) were investigated. The effects of the cAK inhibitor Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS on the reversion of the adrenergic tension of isolated prostate tissue induced by forskolin, rolipram, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and tadalafil were examined by means of the organ bath technique. RESULTS: Immunosignals specific for cAKIalpha, cAKIIalpha, and cAKIIbeta were observed in the smooth musculature and glandular structures of the prostate. Double stainings revealed the colocalization of alpha-actin and PDE4 with the cAK isoforms. The expression of the cAK isoforms was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The relaxation of the tension induced by norepinephrine brought about by forskolin, rolipram, SNP, and tadalafil was significantly attenuated by Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS. CONCLUSIONS: The colocalization of smooth muscle alpha-actin and PDE4 with cAK, as well as the results from the organ bath experiments, provide further evidence for a pivotal role of the cAMP-dependent signaling in the regulation of prostate smooth muscle contractility.

1011,30914961.0,Development of a Non-invasive Methodology for the Assessment of Muscle Fibre Composition.,Front Physiol,"The percentage area of fast twitch fibres of a muscle is a major determinant of muscle mechanical power and, thus, an important biomarker for the evaluation of training processes. However, the invasive character of the assessment (muscle biopsy) limits the wide application of the biomarker in the training praxis. Our purpose was to develop a non-invasive method for the assessment of fast twitch fibre content in human soleus muscle. From a theoretical point of view, the maximum muscle mechanical power depends on the fibre composition, the muscle volume and muscle specific tension. Therefore, we hypothesised that the percentage area of type II fibres would show a correlation with the maximum muscle mechanical power normalised to muscle volume and specific muscle contractile strength (i.e., plantar flexion moment divided by muscle cross-sectional area). In 20 male adults, the percentage area of type II fibres, volume and maximum cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle as well as the maximum plantar flexion moment and the maximum mechanical power were measured using muscle biopsies, magnetic resonance imaging and dynamometry. The maximum mechanical power normalised to muscle volume and specific muscle contractile strength provided a significant relationship (r = 0.654, p = 0.002) with the percentage area of type II fibres.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the validity and reliability of total, single repetition, and contraction-phase specific TUT during shoulder abduction exercises, based on data from a stretch-sensor attached to an elastic exercise band. METHODS: A concurrent validity and interrater reliability study with two raters was conducted. Twelve participants performed five sets of 10 repetitions of shoulder abduction exercises with an elastic exercise band. Exercises were video-recorded to assess concurrent validity between TUT from stretch-sensor data and from video recordings (gold standard). Agreement between methods was calculated using Limits of Agreement (LoA), and the association was assessed by Pearson correlation coefficients. Interrater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC 2.1). RESULTS: Total, single repetition, and contraction-phase specific TUT - determined from video and stretch-sensor data - were highly correlated (r>0.99). Agreement between methods was high, as LoA ranged from 0.0 to 3.1 seconds for total TUT (2.6% of mean TUT), from -0.26 to 0.56 seconds for single repetition TUT (6.9%), and from -0.29 to 0.56 seconds for contraction-phase specific TUT (13.2-21.1%). Interrater reliability for total, single repetition and contraction-phase specific TUT was high (ICC>0.99). Interrater agreement was high, as LoA ranged from -2.11 to 2.56 seconds for total TUT (4.7%), from -0.46 to 0.50 seconds for single repetition TUT (9.7%) and from -0.41 to 0.44 seconds for contraction-phase specific TUT (5.2-14.5%). CONCLUSION: Data from a stretch-sensor attached to an elastic exercise band is a valid measure of total and single repetition time-under-tension, and the procedure is highly reliable.

1014,17237191.0,Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid relaxing effects involve Ca2+-activated K+ channel activation and CPI-17 dephosphorylation in human bronchi.,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,"The aim of the present study was to provide a mechanistic insight into how 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) relaxes organ-cultured human bronchi. Tension measurements, performed on either fresh or 3-d-cultured bronchi, revealed that the contractile responses to 1 microM methacholine and 10 microM arachidonic acid were largely relaxed by the eicosanoid regioisomer in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-10 microM). Pretreatments with 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid, a specific 14,15-EET antagonist, prevented the relaxing effect, whereas iberitoxin pretreatments (10 nM) partially abolished EET-induced relaxations. In contrast, pretreatments with 1 microM indomethacin amplified relaxations in explants and membrane hyperpolarizations triggered by 14,15-EET on airway smooth muscle cells. The relaxing responses induced by 14,15-EET were likely related to reduced Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments, because free Ca2+ concentration-response curves performed on beta-escin-permeabilized cultured explants were shifted toward higher [Ca2+] (lower pCa2+ values). 14,15-EET also abolished the tonic responses induced by phorbol-ester-dybutyrate (PDBu) (a protein kinase C [PKC]-sensitizing agent), on both fresh (intact) and beta-escin-permeabilized explants. Western blot analyses, using two specific primary antibodies against CPI-17 and its PKC-dependent phosphorylated isoform (p-CPI-17), confirmed that the eicosanoid interferes with this intracellular process. These data indicate that 14,15-EET hyperpolarizes airway smooth muscle cells and relaxes precontracted human bronchi while reducing Ca2+ sensitivity of fresh and cultured explants. The intracellular effects are related to a PKC-dependent process involving a lower phosphorylation level of CPI-17.",2007,36,5,633-41,10.1165/rcmb.2006-0281OC,#3699,Morin 2007,

Most suffer at least occasional episodes. It is becoming increasingly apparent that although psychological factors are not important in the cause of phantom pain, a variety of physiologic problems related to the residual limb are critical to it. Referred pain, initiated by decreased blood flow and microspasms in the residual limb along with problems caused by prosthetics account for most of the phantom pain problems seen clinically. Some pain is referred to the phantom pain from other sites in the body such as the back. Treatments for phantom pain that are not based on recently elucidated physiologic mechanisms have proven to be ineffective for the vast majority and cannot be applied indiscriminantly with any hope of consistent success.

Here, we investigated their involvement in β-adrenoceptor (AR)-mediated relaxation of rat and human bladder. Concentration-response curves of isoprenaline and mirabegron-induced bladder relaxation were generated against passive tension and KCl- and carbachol-induced tone, in the absence or presence of the BKCa channel inhibitor iberiotoxin (100 nM) or the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27,632 (1 μM). Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation was studied by Western blot. In rat, iberiotoxin only slightly altered isoprenaline- and mirabegron-induced relaxation against KCl-induced tone but attenuated relaxation by both agonists against carbachol-induced tone. Y27,632 enhanced isoprenaline- or mirabegron-induced relaxation only against carbachol-induced tone. In humans, iberiotoxin slightly enhanced relaxation by both agonists against carbachol-induced pre-contraction. Y27,632 did not change isoprenaline-induced relaxation but enhanced that by mirabegron. Under passive tension, MLC phosphorylation was markedly reduced by both β-AR agonists, an effect insensitive to Y27,632. In the presence of carbachol, both β-AR agonists increased MLC phosphorylation, an effect reduced by Y27,632 only in the presence of 1 μM carbachol. These results indicate that the extent of BKCa channel and Rho-kinase involvement in relaxation induced by β-AR agonists depends on pre contractile stimulus and species.",2015,388,7,749-59,10.1007/s00210-015-1128-z,#3702,Cernecka 2015,

The present study applied massage focused on MTrPs of patients with TTH in a placebo-controlled, clinical trial to assess efficacy on reducing headache (HA) pain. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with TTH were randomized to receive 12 massage or placebo (detuned ultrasound) sessions over 6 weeks, or to wait-list. Trigger point release massage focused on MTrPs in cervical musculature. HA pain (frequency, intensity, and duration) was recorded in a daily HA diary. Additional outcome measures included self-report of perceived clinical change in HA pain and pressure-pain threshold at MTrPs in the upper trapezius and suboccipital muscles. RESULTS: From diary recordings, group differences across time were detected in HA frequency (P=0.026), but not for intensity or duration. Post hoc analysis indicated that HA frequency decreased from baseline for both massage (P<0.0003) and placebo (P=0.013), but no difference was detected between massage and placebo. Patient report of perceived clinical change was greater reduction in HA pain for massage than placebo or wait-list groups (P=0.002). Pressure-pain threshold improved in all muscles tested for massage only (all P's<0.002). DISCUSSION: Two findings from this study are apparent: (1) MTrPs are important components in the treatment of TTH, and (2) TTH, like other chronic conditions, is responsive to placebo. Clinical trials on HA that do not include a placebo group are at risk for overestimating the specific contribution from the active intervention.",2015,31,2,159-68,10.1097/AJP.0000000000000091,#3703,Moraska 2015,
1019,22578985.0,Generalized anxiety disorder: is there any specific symptom?,Compr Psychiatry,"OBJECTIVE: The main aim of the present research was to evaluate the coherence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) psychopathological pattern, the robustness of its diagnostic criteria, and the clinical utility of considering this disorder as a discrete condition rather than assigning it a dimensional value. METHOD: The study was designed in a purely naturalistic setting and carried out using a community sample; data from the Sesto Fiorentino Study were reanalyzed. RESULTS: Of the 105 subjects who satisfied the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for the diagnosis of GAD, only 18 (17.1%) had no other comorbid DSM-IV disorder. The most frequent comorbid condition was major depressive disorder (70.4 %). Only 2 of the GAD diagnostic symptoms (excessive worry and muscle tension) showed a specific association with the diagnosis itself, whereas the others, such as feeling wound up, tense, or restless, concentration problems, and fatigue, were found to be more prevalent in major depressive disorder than in GAD. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that GAD, as defined by DSM-IV criteria, shows a substantial overlap with other DSM-IV diagnoses (especially with mood disorders) in the general population. Furthermore, GAD symptoms are frequent in all other disorders included in the mood/anxiety spectrum. Finally, none of the GAD symptoms, apart from muscle tension, distinguished GAD from patients without GAD.",2012,53,8,1056-62,10.1016/j.comppsych.2012.04.002,#3704,Faravelli 2012,
1020,23388387.0,Expression patterns and adaptive functional diversity of vertebrate myoglobins.,Biochim Biophys Acta,"Recent years have witnessed a new round of research on one of the most studied proteins - myoglobin (Mb), the oxygen (O2) carrier of skeletal and heart muscle. Two major discoveries have stimulated research in this field: 1) that Mb has additional protecting functions, such as the regulation of in vivo levels of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by scavenging and generating NO during normoxia and hypoxia, respectively; and 2) that Mb in vertebrates (particularly fish) is expressed as tissue-specific isoforms in other tissues than heart and skeletal muscle, such as vessel endothelium, liver and brain, as found in cyprinid fish. Furthermore, Mb has also been found to protect against oxidative stress after hypoxia and reoxygenation and to undergo allosteric, O2-linked S-nitrosation, as in rainbow trout. Overall, the emerging evidence, particularly from fish species, indicates that Mb fulfills a broader array of physiological functions in a wider range of different tissues than hitherto appreciated. This new knowledge helps to better understand how variations in Mb structure and function may correlate with differences in animals' lifestyles and hypoxia-tolerance. This review integrates old and new results on Mb expression patterns and functional properties amongst vertebrates and discusses how these may relate to adaptive variations in different species.

1021,22705391.0,Motor cortex excitability is tightly coupled to observed movements.,Neuropsychologia,"Although facilitation of the corticospinal (CS) system during action observation is a widely accepted phenomenon, it is still controversial if facilitation reflects the replica of observed movement kinematics or the tension to achieve a particular goal. In this study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscles while participant-volunteers observed a model grasping a small target eliciting a precision grip or a large target eliciting a whole hand grasp directed toward an isolated object or flanked by different sized objects (i.e., distractor). A detailed movement analysis revealed that the model's kinematics were influenced by the distractor's size. Video clips filming the scene were edited in such a way that the distractor was removed from the scene. Participant-volunteers were asked to observe actions characterized by the same goal but performed using different kinematical patterns. Although the differences in movement kinematics were not noticed by the participant-volunteers, they nonetheless elicited distinct configurations of corticospinal activation. Detailed motor matching seems to recruit the same muscles in the onlooker as in the person actually carrying out the action during observation of grasping actions. These effects appear to be elicited by very subtle, imperceptible aspects of observed actions pointing to a finely tuned mechanism that specifically encodes body parts.",2012,50,9,2341-7,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2012.06.002,#3706,Sartori 2012,
1022,24213243.0,Exercise DVD effect on musculoskeletal disorders in professional orchestral musicians.,Occup Med (Lond),"BACKGROUND: Professional musicians report a high prevalence of performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). Excessive muscle tension and fatigue have been reported as important factors contributing to PRMDs. AIMS: To evaluate feasibility and effectiveness of a specific exercise programme delivered via a digital video disc (DVD) targeting PRMDs and associated risk factors. METHODS: Volunteers from eight Australian symphony orchestras undertook two or more sessions per week over 12 weeks. Questionnaires were administered pre- and post-intervention with items including the frequency and severity of PRMDs, perceived exertion during different playing situations, per formance effects of the DVD and satisfaction rates. Musicians who had also participated in an equivalent face-to-face programme prior to this DVD trial compared the two interventions. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-four out of 576 musicians volunteered (25% uptake), and 50 participants completed a mean 2.1 (SD 0.42) sessions over the 12 week period (41% compliance). PRMD frequency and severity were significantly reduced post-intervention (P < 0.01). Participants reported benefits of the DVD on strengthening muscles, increasing ease of movement and improving flexibility related to playing. Despite this, perceived exertion levels during private practice, rehearsal and performance remained the same (not significant). Seventy-eight per cent of participants scored their overall experience of the use of the DVD as good or excellent. Owing to its convenience and detailed exercise demonstrations, the DVD was rated as better or much better overall than the face-to-face classes by 55% of participants who had experienced both. CONCLUSIONS: An exercise DVD was well received and appeared to be effective, convenient and safe in managing occupational-specific musculoskeletal disorders in musicians.",2014,64,1,23-30,10.1093/occmed/kqt117,#3707,Chan 2014,Exercise
1023,22506794.0,Generalized anxiety disorder: a comparison of symptom change in adults receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy or applied relaxation.,J Consult Clin Psychol,"OBJECTIVE: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive worry and somatic symptoms of anxiety (e.g., restlessness, muscle tension). Several psychological treatments lead to significant reductions in GAD symptoms by posttreatment. However, little is known about how GAD symptoms change over time. Our main goal was to examine how GAD symptoms changed in relation to one another during 2 distinct but efficacious psychological treatments: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and applied relaxation (AR). Specifically, we asked whether change in worry accounted for change over time in somatic anxiety (or the reverse) to the same degree in CBT and AR. METHOD: We examined data from 57 individuals with GAD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Self-report measures of worry and somatic anxiety were obtained daily during treatment. RESULTS: Although the direction of influence between changes in worry and somatic anxiety was bidirectional to some extent in both treatments, a significant difference was also observed: Change in worry accounted for subsequent change in somatic anxiety to a greater extent in CBT than in AR. CONCLUSIONS: These findings allowed us to identify differences in a mechanism of change in GAD symptoms during 2 treatments and to provide some support for the idea that similarly efficacious treatments may produce symptom change via different mechanisms in a manner that is consistent with the theoretical rationales on which the treatments are based.",2012,80,3,490-6,10.1037/a0028132,#3708,Donegan 2012,
1024,1852567.0,Autonomic and skeletal muscle responses to nonelectrical cutaneous stimulation.,Percept Mot Skills,"Cutaneous stimulation has had a long history as a method of pain control. While there is general agreement that modern techniques such as electrical stimulation and massage often provide relief from acute pain and may in some cases significantly affect chronic pain, the mechanism by which these techniques affect pain remains unclear. Significant attention has been focused on the effects of stimulation on the autonomic nervous system (ANS) along with the increasing evidence of important ANS modulation of nociceptive activity throughout the pain pathway. However, inconsistent results on the presence and direction of ANS changes from cutaneous stimulation characterize the recent literature. The present study investigated a nonelectrical cutaneous stimulation device, the Dermapoints Massageroller, as well as an active placebo massage. The results indicate that the Dermapoints Massageroller has both general effects associated with simple skin stimulation (such as increased skin temperature), as well as specific effects from increased stimulation by the toothed design of the roller. These specific effects include decreased muscle tension (at least for some muscle sites) and increased sympathetic activation. The results are consistent with a model of activation of Pacinian receptors as a possible mechanism for the antinociceptive properties of cutaneous stimulation.",1991,72,2,575-84,10.2466/pms.1991.72.2.575,#3709,Naliboff 1991,

To investigate effects of ET in the human esophagus, we measured contraction of isolated human esophageal muscularis mucosae strips caused by ET related peptides and binding of 125I-ET-1 to cell membranes prepared from the human esophageal muscularis mucosae. Autoradiography demonstrated specific binding of 125I-ET-1 to the muscularis mucosae and muscularis propria (muscularis externa) of the human esophagus. ET-1 caused tetrodotoxin and atropine-insensitive contraction of muscularis mucosae strips. In terms of the maximal tension of contraction, ET-1 and ET-2 were equal in efficacy. The relative potencies for ET related peptides to cause contraction were ET-1=ET-2>ET-3>sarafotoxin S6c (SX6c), an ETB receptor agonist. ET-1 caused contraction was mildly inhibited by BQ-123, an ETA receptor antagonist, and not by BQ-788, an ETB receptor antagonist. It was moderately inhibited by the combination of both antagonists, indicating synergistic inhibition. Furthermore, desensitization to SX6c with SX6c pretreatment failed to abolish the contractile response to ET-1, which was completely inhibited by BQ-123. These indicate the involvement of both ETA and ETB receptors in the contraction. Binding of 125I-ET-1 to cell membranes of the muscularis mucosae was saturable and specific. Analysis of dose-inhibition curves demonstrated the presence of ETA and ETB receptors. This study demonstrates that, the muscularis mucosae of the human esophagus, similar to that of the guinea pig esophagus, possesses both ETA and ETB receptors mediating muscle contraction.",2004,117,3,179-86,10.1016/j.regpep.2003.10.016,#3710,Huang 2004,

Eleven patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) were studied in a single-subject experimental design iSSED) study, type A-B-A. The intervention comprised ten weekly TR/HT sessions of 30 minutes each. The subjects were measured a maximum of 13 times. Physical tests were: the Berg balance scale, talking a figure of eight, the timed up and go test, 10 m walking, the modified Ashworth scale, the Index of Muscle Function, the Birgitta Lindmark motor assessment, part B, and individual measurements. Self-rated measures were. the Visual Analog Scale for pain, a scale for SRLMT, the Patient-Specific Functional Scale for ADL, and the SF-36. Data were analyzed visually, semi-statistically and considering clinical significance. Results showed improvement for ten subjects in one or more of the variables, particularly balance, and some improvements were also seen in pain, muscle tension, and ADL. Changes in SF-36 were mostly positive, with an improvement in Role-Emotional seen in eight patients. Conclusively, balance and Role-Emotional were the variables most often improved, but TR/HT appeared to benefit the subjects differently.",2005,21,1,51-77,10.1080/09593980590911525,#3711,Hammer 2005,
1027,14996881.0,Dynamic loading of the plantar aponeurosis in walking.,J Bone Joint Surg Am,"BACKGROUND: The plantar aponeurosis is known to be a major contributor to arch support, but its role in transferring Achilles tendon loads to the forefoot remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to increase our understanding of the function of the plantar aponeurosis during gait. We specifically examined the plantar aponeurosis force pattern and its relationship to Achilles tendon forces during simulations of the stance phase of gait in a cadaver model. METHODS: Walking simulations were performed with seven cadaver feet. The movements of the foot and the ground reaction forces during the stance phase were reproduced by prescribing the kinematics of the proximal part of the tibia and applying forces to the tendons of extrinsic foot muscles. A fiberoptic cable was passed through the plantar aponeurosis perpendicular to its loading axis, and raw fiberoptic transducer output, tendon forces applied by the experimental setup, and ground reaction forces were simultaneously recorded during each simulation. A post-experiment calibration related fiberoptic output to plantar aponeurosis force, and linear regression analysis was used to characterize the relationship between Achilles tendon force and plantar aponeurosis tension. RESULTS: Plantar aponeurosis forces gradually increased during stance and peaked in late stance. Maximum tension averaged 96% +/- 36% of body weight. There was a good correlation between plantar aponeurosis tension and Achilles tendon force (r = 0.76). CONCLUSIONS: The plantar aponeurosis transmits large forces between the hindfoot and forefoot during the stance phase of gait. The varying pattern of plantar aponeurosis force and its relationship to Achilles tendon force demonstrates the importance of analyzing the function of the plantar aponeurosis throughout the stance phase of the gait cycle rather than in a static standing position. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The plantar aponeurosis plays an important role in transmitting Achilles tendon forces to the forefoot in the latter part of the stance phase of walking. Surgical procedures that require the release of this structure may disturb this mechanism and thus compromise efficient propulsion.",2004,86,3,546-52,10.2106/00004623-200403000-00013,#3712,Erdemir 2004,

Twenty-one females meeting specific criteria were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: a dental splint and physiotherapy program; a relaxation program utilizing progressive muscle relaxation, biofeedback, and stress management techniques; or a minimal treatment program involving transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Improvement was assessed through a dental examination, self-monitoring of pain, and an assessment of EMG activity during resting and task conditions. Significant changes were obtained in response to all treatment programs. The treatment programs differed only in the relative pattern of treatment effects obtained from the self-report monitoring of pain.

1029,28493923.0,Brief relaxation training is not sufficient to alter tolerance to experimental pain in novices.,PLoS One,"Relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation, are aspects common to most forms of mindfulness training. There is now an abundance of research demonstrating that mindfulness training has beneficial effects across a wide range of clinical conditions, making it an important tool for clinical intervention. One area of extensive research is on the beneficial effects of mindfulness on experiences of pain. However, the mechanisms of these effects are still not well understood. One hypothesis is that the relaxation components of mindfulness training, through alterations in breathing and muscle tension, leads to changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system functioning which influences pain circuits. The current study seeks to examine how two of the relaxation subcomponents of mindfulness training, deep breathing and muscle relaxation, influence experiences of pain in healthy individuals. Participants were randomized to either a 10 minute deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or control condition after which they were exposed to a cold pain task. Throughout the experiment, measures of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity were collected to assess how deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation alter physiological responses, and if these changes moderate any effects of these interventions on responses to pain. There were no differences in participants' pain tolerances or self-reported pain ratings during the cold pain task or in participants' physiological responses to the task. Additionally, individual differences in physiological functioning were not related to differences in pain tolerance or pain ratings. Overall this study suggests that the mechanisms through which mindfulness exerts its effects on pain are more complex than merely through physiological changes brought about by altering breathing or muscle tension. This indicates a need for more research examining the specific subcomponents of mindfulness, and how these subcomponents might be acting, to better understand their utility as a clinical treatment.",2017,12,5,e0177228,10.1371/journal.pone.0177228,#3714,Smith 2017,
1030,26388782.0,Nutritional interventions to augment resistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.,Front Physiol,"Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by a balance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB). In healthy humans, MPS is more sensitive (varying 4-5 times more than MPB) to changes in protein feeding and loading rendering it the primary locus determining gains in muscle mass. Performing resistance exercise (RE) followed by the consumption of protein results in an augmentation of MPS and, over time, can lead to muscle hypertrophy. The magnitude of the RE-induced increase in MPS is dictated by a variety of factors including: the dose of protein, source of protein, and possibly the distribution and timing of post-exercise protein ingestion. In addition, RE variables such as frequency of sessions, time under tension, volume, and training status play roles in regulating MPS. This review provides a brief overview of our current understanding of how RE and protein ingestion can influence gains in skeletal muscle mass in young, healthy individuals. It is the goal of this review to provide nutritional recommendations for optimal skeletal muscle adaptation. Specifically, we will focus on how the manipulation of protein intake during the recovery period following RE augments the adaptive response.",2015,6,,245,10.3389/fphys.2015.00245,#3715,Morton 2015,anabolism
1031,32104881.0,The role of membrane-shaping BAR domain proteins in caveolar invagination: from mechanistic insights to pathophysiological consequences.,Biochem Soc Trans,"The formation of caveolae, bulb-shaped plasma membrane invaginations, requires the coordinated action of distinct lipid-interacting and -shaping proteins. The interdependence of caveolar structure and function has evoked substantial scientific interest given the association of human diseases with caveolar dysfunction. Model systems deficient of core components of caveolae, caveolins or cavins, did not allow for an explicit attribution of observed functional defects to the requirement of caveolar invagination as they lack both invaginated caveolae and caveolin proteins. Knockdown studies in cultured cells and recent knockout studies in mice identified an additional family of membrane-shaping proteins crucial for caveolar formation, syndapins (PACSINs) - BAR domain superfamily proteins characterized by crescent-shaped membrane binding interfaces recognizing and inducing distinct curved membrane topologies. Importantly, syndapin loss-of-function resulted exclusively in impairment of caveolar invagination without a reduction in caveolin or cavin at the plasma membrane, thereby allowing the specific role of the caveolar invagination to be unveiled. Muscle cells of syndapin III KO mice showed severe reductions of caveolae reminiscent of human caveolinopathies and were more vulnerable to membrane damage upon changes in membrane tensions. Consistent with the lack of syndapin III-dependent invaginated caveolae providing mechanoprotection by releasing membrane reservoirs through caveolar flattening, physical exercise of syndapin III KO mice resulted in pathological defects reminiscent of the clinical symptoms of human myopathies associated with caveolin 3 mutation suggesting that the ability of muscular caveolae to respond to mechanical forces is a key physiological process.",2020,48,1,137-146,10.1042/BST20190377,#3716,Kessels 2020,BAR domain

In myometrial cell membranes, no specific [125I]ET-3 binding was observed. Inhibition of [125I]ET-1 binding by unlabeled compounds showed the following order of potency: ET-1 = FR 139317 > ET-3 >> S6c. Furthermore, ET-1 increased inositol phosphate (IP) production in a dose-dependent manner. ET-1-induced IP accumulation was totally abolished by FR 139317 (an ETA-selective antagonist) but was not altered by IRL 1038 (an ETB-selective antagonist).

For the other forms of primary headaches, especially those of Chapters 2 and 3 of the classification, there are however therapies that, even if not specific, can give significant results. Tension-type headache recognizes in NSAIDs the most effective drugs to treat acute attack, while prevention is based on the use of tricyclic antidepressants and muscle relaxants. For TACs, the discussion is more complex: first of all, there are two forms of primary headache that respond absolutely to indomethacin. For these, the main problem is how to manage the possible side effects arising from prolonged treatments and possibly what to use as an alternative. For cluster headaches and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks, we have drugs with good efficacy as regards medical therapy, such as verapamil or lamotrigine, but in recent years, neuromodulation techniques, both surgical and non-invasive, have also been affirming themselves, which represent a more possibility for forms of headache that are often very disabling and resistant to common analgesics.",2020,41,Suppl 2,385-394,10.1007/s10072-020-04762-2,#3718,Frediani 2020,Cluster headache

METHODS: From January 1996 to June 2006, 41 patients underwent tracheo-carinal airway reconstructions using 45 extrathoracic muscle flaps (latissimus dorsi, n=25; serratus anterior, n=18; pectoralis major, n=2) for closing airway defects resulting from (a) bronchopleural fistulas (BPF) with short desmoplastic bronchial stumps after right upper lobectomy (n=1) and right-sided (pleuro) pneumonectomy (n=13); (b) right (n=9) and left (n=3) associated with partial carinal resections for pre-treated centrally localised tumours; (c) partial non-circumferential tracheal resections for pre-treated tracheal tumours, tracheo-oesophageal fistulas (TEF) and chronic tracheal injury with tracheomalacia (n=11); (d) carinal resections with the integration of a muscle patch in specific parts of the anastomotic reconstruction for alleviation of anastomotic tension (n=4). The airway defects ranged from 2 x 1 cm to 8 x 4 cm and involved up to 50% of the airway circumference. The patients were followed by clinical examination, repeated bronchoscopy, pulmonary function testing and CT scans. The minimum follow-up time was 6 months. RESULTS: Ninety-day mortality was 7.3% (3/41 patients). Four patients (9.7%) sustained muscle flap necrosis requiring re-operation and flap replacement without subsequent mortality, airway dehiscence or stenosis. Airway dehiscence was observed in 1/41 patients (2.4%) and airway stenosis in 1/38 surviving patients (2.6%) responding well to topical mitomycin application. Follow-up on clinical grounds, by CT scans and repeated bronchoscopy, revealed airtight, stable and epithelialised airways and no recurrence of BPF or TEF in all surviving patients.

It has often been believed that ROCK1 and ROCK2 may be functionally redundant, as they share a highly conserved kinase domain. However, in this study, we report differential functional effects for these ROCKs at the epithelial zonula adherens (ZA). Using specific siRNA, we found that ROCK1 depletion disrupted cadherin organization at the ZA, accompanied by loss of F-actin and NMIIA, whereas ROCK2 knockdown had no significant effect. Further, ROCK1, but not ROCK2, was necessary to stabilize GTP-RhoA at the ZA, thereby sustaining junctional tension and inhibiting intraepithelial cell movement. We also found that nonmuscle myosin IIA is a major determinant of ROCK1 cortical stability. Thus, despite sharing the catalytic domain with ROCK2, ROCK1 appears to be the dominant kinase essential for junctional integrity and contractile tension at epithelial ZA.",2017,28,1,20-Dec,10.1091/mbc.E16-04-0262,#3720,Priya 2017,
1036,23135639.0,Effect of minimizing tension during robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy on urinary function recovery.,World J Urol,"OBJECTIVES: Although most prostatectomy studies emphasize optimal nerve-sparing dissection planes, subtle technical variation also affects functional outcomes. The impact of minimizing assistant/surgeon tension on urinary function has not been quantified. We assess urinary function after attenuating neurovascular bundle (NVB) and rhabdosphincter tension during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). METHODS: Retrospective study of prospectively collected data for 268 (RARP-T) versus 342 (RARP-0T) men with versus without tension on the NVB and rhabdosphincter during RARP. Outcomes compared include Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC) urinary function, estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time, and positive surgical margins (PSM). RESULTS: In unadjusted analysis, men undergoing RARP-T versus RARP-0T were older, had higher biopsy and pathologic Gleason grade, and higher preoperative prostate specific antigen (all p ≤ 0.023). Baseline urinary function was similar. Postoperatively, RARP-0T versus RARP-T was associated with higher 5-month urinary function scores (69.7 versus 64, p = 0.049). In adjusted analyses, RARP-0T versus RARP-T was associated with improved 5-month urinary function [Parameter Estimate (PE) 7.37, Standard Error (SE) 2.67, p = 0.006], while bilateral versus non-/unilateral nerve-sparing was associated with improved 12-month urinary function and continence (both p ≤ 0.035). RARP-0T versus RARP-T was associated with shorter operative times (PE 6.66, SE 1.90, p = 0.001) and higher EBL (PE 20.88, SE 6.49, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in PSM. CONCLUSIONS: While the use of tension aids in dissection of anatomic planes, avoidance of NVB counter-traction and minimizing tension on the rhabdosphincter during apical dissection attenuates neuropraxia and leads to earlier urinary function recovery. Bilateral versus non-/unilateral nerve-sparing also improves urinary function recovery.",2013,31,3,515-21,10.1007/s00345-012-0973-3,#3721,Kowalczyk 2013,

Possible reasons for this difference were explored with the use of a computer implemented aerodynamic model, giving an output of air pressure and flow. Input parameters were adjusted in accordance with known or hypothesized variations in glottal area function, vocal tract wall tension, respiratory muscle force, and supraglottal cavity volume, as given in the literature. In addition to the previously known differences in glottal area, it is inferred from the results of the modeling experiment that fortis stops are produced with greater vocal tract wall tension than lenis stops. Speaker-specific production strategies such as larynx lowering and heightened subglottal pressure during fortis stops and differences noted between word pairs are also discussed.",1987,81,1,138-47,10.1121/1.395023,#3723,Dart 1987,
1039,2160090.0,"Species differences in the effects of leukotriene D4 on inositol trisphosphate accumulation, cyclic AMP formation and contraction in iris sphincter of the mammalian eye.",Prostaglandins,"The effects of leukotriene (LT) D4 on inositol trisphosphate (IP3) accumulation, cAMP formation, and contraction in the iris sphincter smooth muscle of different mammalian species were investigated and functional and biochemical reciprocal interactions between the IP3-Ca2+ and cAMP second messenger systems were demonstrated. The effects of the LT on the biochemical and pharmacological responses are dose- and time-dependent, and are not mediated through the release of acetylcholine or prostaglandins. Addition of LTD4 (0.1-1 microM) to cat and bovine iris sphincters increased IP3 accumulation by 60% of that of the control and induced muscle contraction (the EC50 value for the contractile response in the cat sphincter was 4.8 x 10(-9) M), but had no effect on cAMP formation in these species. In contrast, addition of LTD4 to dog, human, pig, and rabbit sphincters increased cAMP formation by 53-61% of their respective controls, but had no effect on IP3 accumulation and on the contractile state. The rates of formation of LTs in iris sphincters of the different species were found to increase in the following order: bovine less than cat less than human less than dog less than pig less than rabbit. This could suggest that desensitization of LT receptors may in part underlie the species differences observed in the effects of LTD4. We suggest that LTD4 may be involved in regulation of contraction and relaxation in the iris sphincter by increasing IP3 accumulation and consequently Ca2+ mobilization and muscle contraction, and by elevating the level of cAMP which in turn may be involved in the regulation of muscle tension.",1990,39,3,227-40,10.1016/0090-6980(90)90043-u,#3724,Yousufzai 1990,
1040,25562661.0,Three-dimensional analysis of a lofted instep kick by male and female footballers.,Eur J Sport Sci,"There is a paucity of data describing the lofted instep kick and little information on the kinematic differences between male and female footballers. This study provides a preliminary investigation into the differences in motion patterns between the sexes. A four-camera motion analysis system videoed 13 amateur footballers (7 female and 6 male) attempting a standardised task that represented a lofted instep kick of approximately 35 m. Footballers performed 20 kicks, with the three trials categorised closest to the standardised distance retained for statistical analysis. Three-dimensional motion patterns for kicks of 35 m illustrated that female footballers produced greater fluctuation in movement patterns for pelvic, hip joint and thoracolumbar spine motion in the frontal plane; thorax and hip joint transverse rotation; and ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion motion. Peak hip extension (P = 0.018), impact hip abduction (P = 0.032), impact ankle plantar flexion (P = 0.030) and resultant ball velocity (P = 0.004) differed significantly between sexes. Principle component analysis highlighted associations between kinematic variables related to ball velocity and sex including a reduced hip abduction and increased internal rotation approaching impact, and greater peak knee flexion, respectively. In summary, increased variation in direction of segment motion, increased backswing and formation of a tension arc by females compared to males, may be related to anthropometric, strength and muscle activation differences. Specifically, this exploratory study indicates future research would benefit from exploring trunk, pelvis and hip kinematics and kinetics, and whether training the trunk, pelvis and hip musculature assists female footballers.",2016,16,1,57-64,10.1080/17461391.2014.992477,#3725,Smith 2016,Hip
1041,18207359.0,Muscle tension dysphonia in Vietnamese female teachers.,J Voice,"There has been no published research on muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) in speakers who use a tonal language. Using a sample of 47 Northern Vietnamese female primary school teachers with MTD, we aimed to discover whether professional voice users of tonal languages presented with the same symptoms of MTD as speakers of nontonal languages and whether they presented with additional symptoms as a result of speaking a tonal language. The vocal characteristics were assessed by use of a questionnaire and expert perceptual evaluation. Laryngeal features were assessed by photolaryngoscopy. The results showed that MTD was associated with a larger number of vocal symptoms than previously reported. However, the participants did not have the same vocal symptoms reported in English speakers, for example, hard glottal attack, pitch breaks, unusual speech rate, and glottal fry. Factor analysis of the vocal symptoms revealed three factors: ""vocal fatigue/hyperfunction,"" ""physical discomfort,"" and ""voice quality,"" all of which demonstrated high reliability. The major laryngeal characteristic was a glottal gap. The glottal shapes observed included: 44.7% had an incomplete closure, 29.8% a posterior gap, 12.8% an hourglass-shaped gap, 8.5% a spindle-shaped gap, and 4.3% had complete glottal closure. The findings implied a potential contribution of linguistic-specific factors and teaching-related factors to the presentation of this voice disorder in this group of teachers.",2009,23,2,195-208,10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.09.003,#3726,Nguyen 2009,

This study investigated the relationship between the shear modulus and passive tension in the posterior shoulder capsule using SWE. Ten posterior middle and ten posterior inferior shoulder capsules were dissected from ten fresh-frozen cadavers; humeral head-capsule-glenoid specimens were created from each capsule. The humeral head and glenoid were immobilized with clamps in a custom-built device. Loads (0-400 g, in 25-g increments) were applied to each capsule via a pulley system; elasticity was simultaneously measured using SWE. The elasticity-load relationship of each tested capsule was analyzed by fitting a least-squares regression line to the data. Elasticity change due to creep or hysteresis effects was evaluated by comparing the elastic modulus for a 100-g load during and after the stepwise application of the loads. The observed relationship between the shear modulus and passive capsule tension was highly linear for all twenty tested capsules (p < 0.01). The mean coefficient of determination was 0.882 ± 0.075 and 0.901 ± 0.050 for the posterior middle and posterior inferior capsules, respectively. There was no difference in the shear modulus between the two 100-g load assessments for both the posterior middle (p = 0.205) and posterior inferior capsules (p = 0.161). Thus, SWE is a valid and useful method for indirectly evaluating the change in the passive tension under loading in specific posterior shoulder capsule.",2020,99,,109498,10.1016/j.jbiomech.2019.109498,#3727,Iida 2020,Elasticity
1043,12696998.0,Preventative treatment for migraine and tension-type headaches : do drugs having effects on muscle spasm and tone have a role?,CNS Drugs,"Baclofen, tizanidine and botulinum toxin A, agents used to treat disorders of muscle tone, have been studied as potential preventative treatments for migraine, tension-type headache and other related disorders. The most extensive work has been completed with botulinum toxin A. However, there is still a paucity of well controlled, clinical trials with this agent, and overall there have been conflicting and oftentimes equivocal results: studies of its use in migraine headache have suggested efficacy, whereas those of tension-type headache have not shown significant evidence of efficacy. There were few significant adverse events associated with the use of botulinum toxin A in these trials. The mechanism by which botulinum toxin A may work to prevent headache is not clear. Although changes in muscle tone may play a role in the effect of the drug, central mechanisms such as effects on neuropeptides involved in the pathogenesis of migraine may also be relevant. Further clinical trial work is in progress to help determine optimal administration schedules and choice of injection locations with botulinum toxin A for specific headache disorders. There has been limited study of the use of baclofen, an agent that acts centrally via GABA(A) receptors, in migraine and cluster headache, with only two open trials conducted to date. Both of these studies support the use of baclofen in the preventive treatment of headache.Tizanidine, which may have both a peripheral and a central mechanism in the locus ceruleus in migraine headache, has been studied in several clinical trials. Although the primary mechanism of action of this agent is, like clonidine, as an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, it has little antihypertensive effect. Open trials of tizanidine have shown it to be useful in chronic headache. One well controlled trial, conducted as a follow-up to an open-label trial in the preventive treatment of chronic daily headache, reported tizanidine as having a statistically significant benefit over placebo. Also of interest is its use in conjunction with a long-acting NSAID to aid in the treatment of rebound headache accompanying the discontinuation of overused acute migraine therapies. In conclusion, though limited, the studies suggest the efficacy of botulinum toxin A, baclofen and tizanidine in primary headache disorders.",2003,17,6,373-81,10.2165/00023210-200317060-00001,#3728,Freitag 2003,
1044,8253866.0,Endothelial cell hypoxia associated proteins are cell and stress specific.,J Cell Physiol,"Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are one of the initial cells exposed to decreases in blood oxygen tension. Bovine EC respond not only by altering secretion of vasoactive, mitogenic, and thrombogenic substances, but also by developing adaptive mechanisms in order to survive acute and chronic hypoxic exposures. EC exposed to hypoxia in vitro upregulate a unique set of stress proteins of Mr 34, 36, 39, 47, and 56 kD. Previous studies have shown that these proteins are cell associated, upregulated in a time and oxygen-concentration dependent manner, and are distinct from heat shock (HSPs) and glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs). To further characterize these hypoxia-associated proteins (HAPs), we investigated their upregulation in human EC from various vascular beds and compared this to possible HAP upregulation in other cell types. Human aortic, pulmonary artery, and microvascular EC upregulated the same set of proteins in response to hypoxia. In comparison, neither lung fibroblasts, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, pulmonary alveolar type II cells, nor renal tubular epithelial cells upregulated proteins of these Mr. Instead, most of these cell types induced synthesis of proteins of Mrs corresponding to either HSPs, GRPs, or both. Further studies demonstrated that exposure of EC to related stresses such as cyanide, 2-deoxyglucose, hydrogen peroxide, dithiothreitol, and glucose deprivation did not cause upregulation of HAPs. Evaluation of cellular damage during hypoxia using phase-contrast microscopy, trypan blue exclusion, chromium release, and adherent cell counts showed that EC survived longer with less damage than any of the above cell types. The induction of HAPs, and the lack of induction of HSPs or GRPs, by EC in response to hypoxia may be related to their unique ability to tolerate hypoxia for prolonged periods.",1993,157,3,544-54,10.1002/jcp.1041570314,#3729,Graven 1993,

Diagnosis of headache was established according to the criteria of the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society. In the group of 150 displaced persons the authors have found 106 (70%), 31 (30%) among males and 75 (70%) among females) psychogenic headaches. Psychogenic headache appeared in 53% of the male cases and was connected with psychoticism (1.7%), conversion (8.3%) and depression (43%), and in 81% of the female cases expression of conversion (4.3%) or a follower of anxiety (10.7%) and depression (66%). Headache is together with anxiety and depression most frequently found in the age groups 31-40 and 51-60 years, among married individuals (76%), and among those with secondary school education (86%). In the group of psychogenic headaches, 13 (42%) males and 23 (30%) females had elements of muscle contraction (tension) headaches, and 9 (29%) males and 8 (10%) females, mainly from the groups 31-40 and 51-60 years with lower educational level had elements of combined vascular and tension headaches.

Dynamometry was performed on each using the Jamar five handle-position test. Injury causes loss of power and there is a significant relationship between the percentage loss of power and the measured whole limb impairment. This paper presents a new approach for the analysis of the tests. The normal physiological length-tension pattern of muscle is maintained in the majority of claimants albeit with modifications due to the specific effects of injury on hand function. This paper provides normative data for the analysis of dynamometry in this population and makes recommendations for parameters that suggest that a test is a true reflection of capacity and thus useable in court.,2017,85,1,23-32,10.1177/0025817216681690,#3731,Belcher 2017,Dynamometry
1047,27309543.0,Predicting Achievable Fundamental Frequency Ranges in Vocalization Across Species.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Vocal folds are used as sound sources in various species, but it is unknown how vocal fold morphologies are optimized for different acoustic objectives. Here we identify two main variables affecting range of vocal fold vibration frequency, namely vocal fold elongation and tissue fiber stress. A simple vibrating string model is used to predict fundamental frequency ranges across species of different vocal fold sizes. While average fundamental frequency is predominantly determined by vocal fold length (larynx size), range of fundamental frequency is facilitated by (1) laryngeal muscles that control elongation and by (2) nonlinearity in tissue fiber tension. One adaptation that would increase fundamental frequency range is greater freedom in joint rotation or gliding of two cartilages (thyroid and cricoid), so that vocal fold length change is maximized. Alternatively, tissue layers can develop to bear a disproportionate fiber tension (i.e., a ligament with high density collagen fibers), increasing the fundamental frequency range and thereby vocal versatility. The range of fundamental frequency across species is thus not simply one-dimensional, but can be conceptualized as the dependent variable in a multi-dimensional morphospace. In humans, this could allow for variations that could be clinically important for voice therapy and vocal fold repair. Alternative solutions could also have importance in vocal training for singing and other highly-skilled vocalizations.",2016,12,6,e1004907,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004907,#3732,Titze 2016,
1048,19632150.0,Blink reflexes in chronic tension-type headache patients and healthy controls.,Clin Neurophysiol,"OBJECTIVE: To use the R2 component of nociceptive-specific blink reflex (nBR) to probe the trigeminal nociceptive system and compare chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) patients and healthy controls. METHODS: Thirty patients with CTTH and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were included. nBR were evoked by painful electrical pulses (0.5ms duration), delivered by a concentric electrode placed on the left lower forehead close to the supraorbital foramen. The EMG activity in the orbicularis oculi muscles was recorded bilaterally. The electrical stimulus intensities to evoke individual sensory threshold (Is) and pin-prick pain sensation (Ip) were assessed. A fixed stimulation intensity of 1.5x Ip was used to evoke the nBR. The perceived pain intensity of the electrical stimulus (I(BR)) was assessed by the subjects on a 0-10cm visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Is did not differ between CTTH patients and controls (P=0.687) but were lower in females than in males (P=0.020). CTTH patients had higher scores on I(BR) than controls (P=0.026). ANOVA showed significantly higher pre-stimulus EMG values in CTTH patients on the left (stimulated) side (P<0.001), whereas there were no differences between males and females (P>0.168). There were no significant differences in the absolute values of the nBR, however CTTH patients had significantly lower values of the normalized root mean square (RMS) (P=0.035) and area under the curve (AUC) (P=0.042) of the nBR on the left side compared with control subjects with no sex-related differences (P>0.070). The onset latencies and duration were not significantly different between CTTH and control subjects or between female and male subjects (P>0.270). There was no significant correlation between any of the BR parameters (RMS, AUC) and clinical characteristics of CTTH (headache intensity and duration) (P>0.163). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study did not detect a significantly different blink reflex response in CTTH patients, but suggested that painful electrical stimulation was associated with consistent increases in eye muscle activity on the same side. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings add further information to central nociceptive pathways in CTTH patients.",2009,120,9,1711-6,10.1016/j.clinph.2009.06.024,#3733,Peddireddy 2009,
1049,34440858.0,Immobilization of Jagged1 Enhances Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Maturation by Activating the Notch Pathway.,Cells,"In Notch signaling, the Jagged1-Notch3 ligand-receptor pairing is implicated for regulating the phenotype maturity of vascular smooth muscle cells. However, less is known about the role of Jagged1 presentation strategy in this regulation. In this study, we used bead-immobilized Jagged1 to direct phenotype control of primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC), and to differentiate embryonic multipotent mesenchymal progenitor (10T1/2) cell towards a vascular lineage. This Jagged1 presentation strategy was sufficient to activate the Notch transcription factor HES1 and induce early-stage contractile markers, including smooth muscle α-actin and calponin in HCASMCs. Bead-bound Jagged1 was unable to regulate the late-stage markers myosin heavy chain and smoothelin; however, serum starvation and TGFβ1 were used to achieve a fully contractile smooth muscle cell. When progenitor 10T1/2 cells were used for Notch3 signaling, pre-differentiation with TGFβ1 was required for a robust Jagged1 specific response, suggesting a SMC lineage commitment was necessary to direct SMC differentiation and maturity. The presence of a magnetic tension force to the ligand-receptor complex was evaluated for signaling efficacy. Magnetic pulling forces downregulated HES1 and smooth muscle α-actin in both HCASMCs and progenitor 10T1/2 cells. Taken together, this study demonstrated that (i) bead-bound Jagged1 was sufficient to activate Notch3 and promote SMC differentiation/maturation and (ii) magnetic pulling forces did not activate Notch3, suggesting the bead alone was able to provide necessary clustering or traction forces for Notch activation. Notch is highly context-dependent; therefore, these findings provide insights to improve biomaterial-driven Jagged1 control of SMC behavior.",2021,10,8,,10.3390/cells10082089,#3734,Zohorsky 2021,Jagged1
1050,21589690.0,Effects of patterns of pressure application on resting electromyography during massage.,Int J Ther Massage Bodywork,"BACKGROUND: To increase the understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which massage therapy produces health benefits such as pain relief and anxiety reduction, the relationship between specific elements of massage and physiological outcomes must be addressed. PURPOSE: The effects on resting muscular activity of applying varying levels of pressure during massage were investigated. METHODS: In this clinical crossover study, conducted in a simulated clinical setting, human subjects (n = 25; mean age: 34.1 years) received 3 different levels of massage pressure to the legs. A licensed therapist applied pressure to the rectus femoris in a distal-to-proximal direction. Each volunteer received the 3 levels of pressure in 2 different orders-increasing (IP) and decreasing pressures (DP)-separated by at least 4 weeks. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure muscle activity levels at baseline and after each pressure level. RESULTS: During the trials of IP, EMG did not vary significantly [Greenhouse-Geisser corrected analysis of variance F(1.71 df) = 0.30, p = 0.71]. During the trials of DP, EMG varied significantly [Greenhouse-Geisser corrected analysis of variance F(1.58 df) = 4.49, p = 0.03], with the largest variation, an increase of 235%, noted between baseline activity and activity after deep pressure. After application of light pressure, activity returned to baseline levels. Interestingly, the overall levels of force required to achieve subjective pressure levels as reported by the client were higher in the DP protocol than in the IP protocol (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the physiological response of the muscle depends on the pattern of applied pressure during massage. That finding is consistent with a mechanism by which light- or moderate-pressure massage (or a combination) may reduce the gain of spinal nociceptive reflexes. As those reflexes are elevated in chronic pain syndromes, pressure variation provides a possible mechanism for the relief of chronic pain by massage therapy.",2011,4,1,11-Apr,10.3822/ijtmb.v4i1.25,#3735,Roberts 2011,Massage
1051,6399464.0,Arousal reduction with biofeedback-supported respiratory meditation.,Biofeedback Self Regul,"This study investigated the effectiveness of a relaxation procedure that combines a concentration aid, in the form of biofeedback, with elements of approved relaxation procedures. Ten subjects completed two sessions, one with and one without feedback. Half of the subjects started with the feedback session and then completed the session without feedback; the other half had the reverse order. In the experimental procedure, subjects had to concentrate on their exhalation, being supported by respiratory feedback. In the background they heard slow movements of baroque music and relaxation-suggesting sentences. The control procedure contained only background music and relaxation-suggesting sentences. Both procedures elicited a trophotropic response: Finger temperature increased while skin conductance level, number of skin conductance responses, and muscle tension decreased. However, with respiratory feedback and meditation, there was an additional, specific effect, a decrease in respiration and heart rate, to an extent not found in the control procedure. It is suggested that exhalation feedback helps to concentrate on the exhalation process and by this means slows respiration rate, and as a consequence, also heart rate. Therefore, respiratory feedback could be a useful tool for inducing relaxation and slowing of heart rate.",1984,9,4,497-508,10.1007/BF01000565,#3736,Zeier 1984,
1052,19935987.0,Efficacy of biofeedback in the treatment of migraine and tension type headaches.,Pain Physician,"BACKGROUND: Biofeedback is an established non-pharmacologic technique commonly used in the treatment of migraine and tension type headaches. Multiple published studies have suggested that biofeedback is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of headaches, often allowing patients to decrease their dependence on medication. Studies have also suggested that biofeedback may effect a decrease in medical utilization. OBJECTIVE: Assess the efficacy of biofeedback in reducing the frequency and severity of migraine and tension type headaches. DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, single blind, single center controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with migraine with or without aura and/or tension type headaches, by ICHD-1 criteria, age 18 to 55, who had suffered from headaches for more than one year, were entered into the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive biofeedback in addition to the basic relaxation instruction or relaxation techniques alone. All patients received instruction in pain theory. Biofeedback training consisted of 10 50-minute sessions utilizing standard EMG feedback from the frontalis and trapezius muscles and temperature from the third finger of the dominant hand. Visual and auditory feedback was provided. Thirty-three patients were assigned to receive biofeedback plus the relaxation techniques and 31, the relaxation techniques alone. All patients were asked to respond to periodic questionnaires for 36 months. The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The subsidiary analyses were not and the 11 subjects (7 in the relaxation alone and 4 in the biofeedback group) who received no treatment at all were analyzed and the results were qualitatively the same. RESULTS: Patients who completed the program with education in pain theory and relaxation techniques showed a statistically significant decrease in the frequency and severity of the headaches in the first 12 months that continued to 36 months. Biofeedback provided no additional benefit, specifically no change in the frequency or severity of the headaches. After 3 months 48% of those in the relaxation group reported fewer severe headaches, while 35% of those in the biofeedback group reported fewer severe headaches; after 6 months, 52% of those in the relaxation group reported fewer severe headaches as compared with 57% reporting fewer severe headaches in the biofeedback group. The number of medications used by the patients and the utilization of medical care decreased in both groups over 36 months suggesting a regression to the mean. LIMITATIONS: Compliance was an issue throughout the study. Patients dropped out from the outset and that increased over time. Recovery of questionnaires was difficult and fewer were completed at each 3-month interval. Lack of a large control group who did not receive biofeedback or instruction in relaxation techniques. CONCLUSION: Biofeedback is an extremely costly and time-consuming treatment modality that, in our study, provided no additional benefit when compared to simple relaxation techniques alone, in the treatment of migraine and tension type headaches in adults.",2009,12,6,1005-11,,#3737,Mullally 2009,
1053,25733139.0,Integration of cell-cell adhesion and contractile actomyosin activity during morphogenesis.,Curr Top Dev Biol,"During embryonic development, cells become organized into complex tissues. Cells need to adhere and communicate with their immediate and remote neighbors to allow morphogenesis to take place in a coordinated way. Cell-cell adhesion, mediated by transmembrane adhesion receptors such as Cadherins and their intracellular interaction partners, is intimately linked to cell contractility that drives cell shape changes. Research in recent years has revealed that the contractile machinery responsible for cell shape changes, actomyosin, can in fact be organized into a number of different functional assemblies such as cortical-junctional actomyosin, apical-medial actomyosin, supracellular actomyosin cables as well as basal actomyosin networks. During coordinated shape changes of a tissue, these assemblies have to be functionally and mechanically linked between cells through cell-cell junctions. Although many actin-binding proteins associated with adherens junctions have been identified, which specific factors are required for the linkage of particular actomyosin assemblies to junctions is not well understood. This review will summarize our current knowledge, based mainly on the in vivo study of morphogenesis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.",2015,112,,103-27,10.1016/bs.ctdb.2014.11.017,#3738,RÃ¶per 2015,Actomyosin

Most headaches are benign, but all require appropriate assessment. Common types include sinusitis, migraine, and muscle contraction (tension). Headache assessment includes both history and physical examination. The headache history consists of the history of present illness, past history, family history, and environmental and social history. Physical examination begins with general observation and vital sign measurement and proceeds to specific inspection of the head, neck, and facial structures. The nursing interventions carried out are dependent on the interpretation of assessment findings. Pharmacologic interventions, commonly acetaminophen or ibuprofen, may be appropriate if pain management protocols exist. Nonpharmacologic strategies for headache relief include reassurance, rest, ingestion of simple and complex carbohydrate foods, relaxation exercises, or home care.

1056,12890514.0,Growth hormone secretagogue receptors in rat and human gastrointestinal tract and the effects of ghrelin.,Neuroscience,"The peptide hormone ghrelin is known to be present within stomach and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in gut. Although reports suggest that gastric function may be modulated by ghrelin acting via the vagus nerve, the gastrointestinal distribution and functions of its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R), are not clear and may show signs of species-dependency. This study sought to determine the cellular localisation and distribution of GHS-R-immunoreactivity (-Ir) using immunofluorescent histochemistry and explore the function of ghrelin in both human and rat isolated gastric and/or colonic circular muscle preparations in which nerve-mediated responses were evoked by electrical field stimulation. The expression of GHS-R-Ir differed to a greater extent between species than between gut regions of the same species. Both the human and rat gastric and colonic preparations (n=3 each) expressed GHS-R-Ir within neuronal cell bodies and fibres, cells associated with gastric glands and putative entero-endocrine and/or mast cells. Smooth muscle cells and epithelia were devoid of GHS-R-Ir and only rat preparations expressed GHS-R-Ir on nerve fibres associated with the muscle layers. GHS-R-Ir was fully competed in all cases in pre-adsorption studies and antiserum specificity was confirmed using a cell line transiently expressing the rat GHS-R. In rat isolated forestomach circular muscle, ghrelin 0.1-10 microM had no effect on smooth muscle tension but concentration-dependently facilitated the amplitude of contractions evoked by excitatory nerve stimulation (n=4-7; P<0.05 for each concentration versus vehicle; n=18). When examined under similar conditions, in both rat distal colon (n=4-6, P>0.05 each) and human ascending (n=3) and sigmoid (n=1) colon, these concentrations of ghrelin were without effect (P>0.05 each). The data suggest that ghrelin has the potential to profoundly affect gastrointestinal functions in both species and at least one of these functions is to exert a gastric prokinetic activity. Moreover, we suggest that this activity of ghrelin is mediated via the enteric nervous system, in addition to known vagus nerve-dependent mechanisms.",2003,120,2,443-53,10.1016/s0306-4522(03)00327-0,#3741,Dass 2003,
1057,7568914.0,Urine storage mechanisms.,Prog Neurobiol,"The urine storage process depends upon the coordinated control of a storage chamber, the bladder body, and its outlets, the bladder base and urethra. While urine storage disorders are of considerable clinical significance, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Many species possess an ability to alter the duration of urine storage in the face of widely varying filling rates. The storage chamber appears largely responsible for this ability to alter capacity and compliance. However, there has been some controversy over the contribution of intrinsic smooth muscle and extrinsic neural systems to the storage process, which is partly related to the various methodologies used in experimental and clinical studies. Thus, the storage phase is greatly influenced by the filling regimes, anaesthesia, non-specific factors and infusates used in these studies. Further, the techniques used to examine and measure urine storage mechanisms often obscure the subtle nature of this process. There is little doubt that, under natural filling conditions, myogenic factors allow the bladder to store increasing volumes at low pressure. More recent studies indicate that, in addition to a quiescent parasympatho-excitatory drive, the extrinsic neural systems contribute to the storage phase with a precisely controlled sympatho-inhibitory drive. However, the sympatho-inhibitory drive does not increase capacity by promoting high compliance. Instead this drive partially reduces the level of bladder wall tension transduced by the bladder wall mechanoreceptors, and thus delays the time at which the micturition tension threshold is reached.",1995,46,3-Feb,215-37,,#3742,Vaughan 1995,
1058,31441849.0,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome with essential thrombocythemia: A case report.,Medicine (Baltimore),"RATIONALE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare neurological disease of the posterior subcortical white matter that manifests as headache, seizures, visual impairment, disturbance of consciousness, and changes in mental state. While PRES is associated with specific imaging findings involving the posterior circulation area of the brain. In the present study, we report the first case of PRES associated with essential thrombocythemia (ET). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old man suddenly experienced headache, followed by the gradual appearance of consciousness disorders and mental behavior abnormalities. Neurological tests showed that the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12, normal muscle strength and tension of the limbs, and was negative for meningeal irritation. DIAGNOSIS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed extensive vasogenic edema in the deep white matter of the right cerebellum and the left occipital and temporal lobes and a diagnosis of PRES was considered. Routine blood test showed that his platelet count was markedly increased, and the JAK2 V617F mutation analysis with allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction was positive. The bone marrow biopsy indicated an increasing number of megakaryocytes. These findings indicated ET. INTERVENTIONS: PRES was treated with a dehydrating agent and supportive and symptomatic treatments. Aspirin tablets were prescribed to address the patient's ET. OUTCOME: After treatment, the abnormal findings on head imaging were completely reversed. His neurological symptoms were completely relieved. LESSONS: PRES may be correlated with ET; specifically, ET may trigger PRES and be a risk factor for the acute onset of neurological deficits.",2019,98,34,e16759,10.1097/MD.0000000000016759,#3743,Zhang 2019,

Each risk factor has not only direct effects on neck pain but may also exert effects indirectly through other risk factors. This study aimed to test this hypothesized model in office workers. METHODS: A one-year prospective cohort study of 559 healthy office workers was conducted. At baseline, a self-administered questionnaire and standardized physical examination were employed to gather biopsychosocial data. Follow-up data were collected every month for the incidence of neck pain. A regression model was built to analyze factors predicting the onset of neck pain. Path analysis was performed to examine direct and indirect associations between identified risk factors and neck pain. RESULTS: The onset of neck pain was predicted by female gender, having a history of neck pain, monitor position not being level with the eyes, and frequently perceived muscular tension, of which perceived muscular tension was the strongest effector on the onset of neck pain. Gender, history of neck pain, and monitor height had indirect effects on neck pain that were mediated through perceived muscular tension. History of neck pain was the most influential effector on perceived muscular tension. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the hypothesis that each risk factors may contribute to the development of neck pain both directly and indirectly. The combination of risk factors necessary to cause neck pain is likely occupation specific. Perceived muscular tension is hypothesized to be an early sign of musculoskeletal symptoms.",2015,57,2,100-9,10.1539/joh.14-0124-OA,#3744,Paksaichol 2015,
1060,28294471.0,Ultra-brief behavioral skills trainings for blood injection injury phobia.,Depress Anxiety,"BACKGROUND: Blood injection injury (BII) phobia is common, with debilitating consequences to the health and well being of many of its sufferers. BII phobia presents with a unique fear response that can involve drops in blood pressure and ultimately fainting. The aim of this study was to provide proof of concept for a line of brief, easy to implement, video-based interventions for reducing phobic avoidance and fears in BII sufferers. One of the interventions was a novel Hypoventilation Respiratory Training (HRT) aimed at reducing the exaggerated ventilation response (hyperventilation) seen in BII phobia. The response has been linked to cerebral vasoconstriction and fainting symptoms. METHOD: Sixty BII patients were randomly assigned to one of three 12-min video-guided trainings: Symptom-Associated Tension (SAT) training, Relaxation Skills Training (RST), or HRT. Experiential and cardiorespiratory activity to phobic stimuli was assessed before and after training. RESULTS: Both SAT and HRT resulted in overall greater reductions of phobic fears and symptoms than RST. SAT significantly increased heart rate during exposure, and HRT led to significantly reduced ventilation, increases in PCO(2) , and elevated blood pressure throughout exposure and recovery. Treatment expectancy was rated equally high across conditions, whereas credibility ratings were highest for HRT. CONCLUSIONS: Brief, video-based instructions in muscle tension and normocapnic breathing are effective in reducing BII symptom severity and require minimal time and expertise. HRT may be particularly helpful in reducing fainting caused by cerebral vasoconstriction.",2017,34,12,1096-1105,10.1002/da.22616,#3745,Meuret 2017,applied tension
1061,240741.0,Metabolic factors in peripheral circulatory regulation.,Fed Proc,"The old and recent literature bearing on the role of metabolic factors in exercise hyperemia has been reviewed. Two general conclusions have gradually emerged over the years. First, no one factor is by itself a sufficient explanation for the hyperemia. Second, the contributions of the various factors appear to change with time of exercise. While additional temporal studies are needed to firmly establish more specific conclusions, those now available suggest that factors related to skeletal muscle cell depolarization initiate the hyperemia while factors related to oxygen consumption in excess of oxygen delivery contribute more to the maintenance of the hyperemia. For example, the potassium that leaves the skeletal muscle cell on depolarization appears to contribute more to the initiation of the hyperemia than to its maintenance. Hydrogen, on the other hand, appears to have little to do with initiation but may contribute to maintenance, at least with grades of exercise that reduce cellular oxygen tension. The picture that emerges from the review seems to be one of multiple factors acting in concert with a changing temporal pattern.",1975,34,11,2006-11,,#3746,Haddy 1975,

1063,35180105.0,Cell type-specific orientation and migration responses for a microgrooved surface with shallow grooves.,Biomed Mater Eng,"BACKGROUND: Directional cell migration due to mechanosensing for in vivo microenvironment, such as microgrooved surfaces, is an essential process in tissue growth and repair in both normal and pathological states. Cell migration responses on the microgrooved surfaces might be reflected by the cell type difference, which is deeply involved in cellular physiological functions. Although the responses are implicated in focal adhesions (FAs) of cells, limited information is available about cell migration behavior on the microgrooved surfaces whose dimensions are comparable with the size of FAs. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated the cell orientation and migration behavior of normal vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and cervical cancer HeLa cells on the microgrooved surface. METHOD: The cells were cultured on the PDMS substrate comprising shallow grooves with 2-µm width and approximately 150-nm depth, which indicates the same order of magnitude as that of the horizontal and vertical size of FAs, respectively. The cell migration and intracellular structures were analyzed by live cell imaging and confocal fluorescence microscopy. The intracellular tension was also assessed using atomic force microscopy (AFM). RESULTS: VSMCs presenting well-aligned actin stress fibers with mature FAs revealed marked cell elongation and directional migration on the grooves; however, HeLa cells with nonoriented F-actin with smaller FAs did not. The internal force of the actin fibers was significantly higher in VSMCs than that in HeLa cells, and the increase or decrease in the cytoskeletal forces improved or diminished the sensing ability for shallow grooves, respectively. The results strongly indicated that directional cell migration should be modulated by cell type-specific cytoskeletal arrangements and intracellular traction forces. The differences in cell type-specific orientation and migration responses can be emphasized on the microgrooves as large as the horizontal and vertical size of FAs. CONCLUSION: The microgoove structure in the size range of the FA protein complex is a powerful tool to clarify subtle differences in the intracellular force-dependent substrate mechanosensing.",2022,33,5,393-406,10.3233/BME-211356,#3748,Nagayama 2022,Cell biomechanics
1064,6582754.0,Functional treatment of congenital dislocation of the hip.,Acta Orthop Scand Suppl,"A prerequisite for the development of congenital dislocation of the hip is ligamentous laxity of the hip-joint, which is demonstrable shortly after birth when the hip can be easily dislocated and reduced. This situation is described as dislocatable hip. Ligamentous laxity naturally tends to disappear, and 90% of all dislocatable hips in fact stabilize spontaneously. No dislocation develops unless an exogenous factor is involved. In infants born in breech presentation the hyperextension of the knees with the resulting increased tension in the hamstrings plays a role. During or shortly after birth, the deflexion of the hip-joint causes an increased tension in the relatively shortened iliopsoas muscle, as a result of which the hip can be dislocated in postero-superior direction. By the time the infant is two months old secondary changes (more specifically restricted abduction) become more pronounced. It may therefore be stated that contracture of the iliopsoas muscle is one of the causes, and restricted abduction a consequence of congenital dislocation of the hip. The degree of dislocation is determined by a balance between the degree of ligamentous laxity and the influence of exogenous factors. When the infant starts to stand and walk, its body weight also begins to function as a deforming exogenous factor. When dislocatable hips are not treated immediately after birth, the frequency of congenital dislocation of the hip at the age of three months amounts to 1-2 per 1000 neonates. The male:female ratio is 1:4. The secondary changes in the osseous structures of the hip-joint should always be studied three-dimensionally. Apart from conventional antero-posterior pelvic roentgenograms, CT-scans can enhance spatial insight. The secondary changes manifest themselves in an enlarged neck-shaft angle, increased femoral anteversion, an increased inclination of the acetabulum and possibly also in diminished acetabular anteversion. In view of the high radiation load involved, examination by CT-scan is not yet a routine procedure in congenital hip dislocation. Radiological examination is usually confined to an antero-posterior pelvic roentgenogram on which the acetabular angle, the neck-shaft angle and the CE-angle can be measured. These are all values projected in a frontal plane. To determine the real values the degree of acetabular and femoral torsion has to be known. With the aid of the CT-scan the torsion of the acetabulum and of the femoral neck as well as their summation - the instability index - can be measured without difficulty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1984,206,,1-109,10.3109/17453678409154147,#3749,Visser 1984,
1065,20816423.0,Botulinum neurotoxin in the treatment of headache disorders.,Handb Clin Neurol,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) has been in clinical use for the treatment of headaches for over 15 years. Recent double-blind placebo-controlled trials have confirmed the efficacy of BoNT type A (onabtoulinumtoxinA, Botox) in the treatment of chronic migraine. The efficacy of BoNT in the treatment of episodic migraine headaches, cluster headaches, and chronic tension-type headache (TTH) has not been examined in large controlled trials. Presumed mechanisms of action of BoNT in headache disorders are the reduction of afferent input induced by muscle relaxation and inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and calcitonin gene-related peptide, from peripheral sensory nerve terminals. Over 20 years of extensive clinical experience has established a remarkable safety for BoNT, particularly type A and specifically Botox or onabotulinumtoxinA, which has been used much longer and more widely than any other form or serotype of BoNT. Because BoNT is a biological product, the safety and efficacy of one BoNT formulation cannot be extrapolated to a different one, even of the same serotype.",2010,97,,217-32,10.1016/S0072-9752(10)97017-6,#3750,Mauskop 2010,
1066,27539739.0,Fibromyalgia syndrome and temporomandibular disorders with muscular pain. A review.,Mod Rheumatol,"OBJECTIVES: Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) refer to a group of clinical picture affecting the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joint that are characterized by muscular or joint pain, dysfunction (limited or altered functions) and joint noises, as well as other associated symptoms, such as tension headaches, otalgia, dizziness, tinnitus, and others. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a syndrome of unknown etiology involving generalized chronic pain accompanied, in a high percentage of cases, by other symptoms such as asthenia, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and other less frequent symptoms, such as temporomandibular disorders (TMD). DATA: Data were compiled by two experienced examiners following a specific form.

STUDY SELECTION: Comparative clinical studies with patients with both clinical pictures involving the study of pathogenic processes. CONCLUSIONS: Fibromyalgia and temporomandibular disorders with muscle pain both have profiles that affect the muscular system and therefore share many epidemiological, clinical, and physiopathological symptoms. Because of this, we are led to think that there is, if not a common etiology, at least a common pathogenesis. This article revises the physiopathological processes of both clinical pictures in an attempt to determine their similarities and likenesses.

When patients hyperventilated at rest with tidal volumes, breathing frequencies, and end-tidal CO2 tensions similar to those during exercise conditions, bronchodilatation also occurred, and the increase in RL following inhaled histamine during isocapnic hyperventilation was also less than at rest. Since bronchodilatation and inhibition of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction occur during both exercise and isocapnic hyperventilation, we suggest that the mechanism of bronchodilatation during exercise may not necessarily be related to metabolic factors associated with exercise.",1983,54,4,934-42,10.1152/jappl.1983.54.4.934,#3752,Stirling 1983,

Morphologically, the spirally arranged muscle fibres present a tension-dependent ""stretch closure"" and in the event of any reduction of tension, as for example caused by an axial hiatus hernia, the organ may become inefficient. The aim of this study was to evaluate quality of life as the main success criterion after anti-reflux surgery based strictly on the restoration of functional morphology. METHODS: Between January 1999 and December 2000, 185 patients with GERD were treated by surgery in accordance with functional-morphological principles. After dissecting the mediastinum, the gastroesophageal junction was displaced into the abdomen with consecutive retensioning the esophagus. The esophageal hiatus was reconstructed with non-absorbable single knot sutures and strengthened with alloplastic material. The application of a 180 degrees fundus cuff around the posterior esophageal circumference served as a ""spacer"" and also restored the angle of His. Preoperatively, all patients underwent endoscopy, pH metry and manometry. During postoperative follow-up, recurrence rate and quality of life were evaluated via a disease-specific scale. RESULTS: Preoperatively, 85% of the patients had an elevated DeMeester Score with a median of 81.4; 64% had reflux esophagitis and 37% had reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure. All 185 operations were performed without conversion in a median operating time of 74 min. In one patient a lesion of the esophagus was treated during the operation; two patients had lesions of the splenic capsule which were also dealt with during the operation. Postoperatively, pleural effusions occurred in 15 patients and puncture was deemed necessary in one subject. Ninety-three percent were followed up for a median of 45 months and the recurrence rate was 2.3%. The quality of life index was 81.6+/-12.4 points preoperatively, and had significantly improved to 125.2+/-12.7 points in the follow-up. CONCLUSION: Through the functional-morphological concept of anti-reflux surgery comprising the restoration of the tension-dependent ""stretch closure"" of the esophagus, significant long-term improvement in quality of life with a low recurrence rate and perioperative morbidity can be achieved.",2006,391,1,24-31,10.1007/s00423-005-0002-8,#3753,Horstmann 2006,

Patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) may show susceptibility to stress after pain through symptom-specific (lower paraspinal [LP]) muscle reactivity. Patients with CLBP (n = 100) and healthy nonpatients (n = 105) underwent a cold pressor, under sensory focus, distraction, suppression, or control conditions, and then performed mental arithmetic. Only patients under the suppression condition revealed increased LP tension during pain that was sustained during mental arithmetic and sustained systolic blood pressure after mental arithmetic. Patients with CLBP who suppress pain may detrimentally affect responses to the next noxious event, particularly through prolonged LP muscle tension, that may contribute to a cycle of pain-stress-pain.",2006,6,2,180-92,10.1037/1528-3542.6.2.180,#3754,Burns 2006,

The mammaplasty is also characterized by the lateral slipping of the shape with time, cause of the sad aspect of the breast. The purpose of the lateral fold mammaplasty is to facilitate the creation of the desired shape and to stabilize the evolution of this shape with time. The standard mammaplasty technique can determine the sub-mammary fold; the medial contour with its specific shape is already determined. Those inferior and medial folds are stables. But the lateral contour is usually not defined and very rarely stable with time. This procedure creates a well-defined and stable lateral fold, which is the convex junction between the anterior axillary line and the sub-mammary fold. This new fold is designed by attachment with five sutures of the axillary sub-dermal tissues to the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle and just beneath, to the 5th costal arch. A medial tension is applied to the axillary flap before suturing to improve the axillary region. Consequently, the breast shape is more predictable and more stable because the lateral, inferior and medial folds are definitely determined. The realization is simple with no specific complication.

Pivotal to this sensory role is the release of ATP from the urothelium. However, the routes for urothelial ATP release, its modulation by receptor-mediated pathways, and the autocrine/paracrine role of ATP are poorly understood, especially in native tissue. We examined the action of key neurotransmitters: purinergic and muscarinic agonists on ATP release and its paracrine effect. Guinea pig and human urothelial mucosa were mounted in a perfusion trough; superfusate ATP was measured using a luciferin-luciferase assay, and tissue contractions were recorded with a tension transducer. Intracellular Ca²⁺ was measured in isolated urothelial cells with fura-2. The P2Y agonist UTP but not the P2X agonist α,β-methylene-ATP generated ATP release. The muscarinic agonist carbachol and the M₂-preferential agonist oxotremorine also generated ATP release, which was antagonized by the M₂-specific agent methoctramine. Agonist-evoked ATP release was accompanied by mucosal contractions. Urothelial ATP release was differentially mediated by intracellular Ca²⁺ release, cAMP, exocytosis, or connexins. Urothelium-attached smooth muscle exhibited spontaneous contractions that were augmented by subthreshold concentrations of carbachol, which had little direct effect on smooth muscle. This activity was attenuated by desensitizing P2X receptors on smooth muscle. Urothelial ATP release was increased in aging bladders. Purinergic and muscarinic agents produced similar effects in human urothelial tissue. This is the first demonstration of specific modulation of urothelial ATP release in native tissue by purinergic and muscarinic neurotransmitters via distinct mechanisms. Released ATP produces paracrine effects on underlying tissues.

To investigate the intracellular action of thromboxane A2, strips of HUA longitudinal smooth muscle were permeabilized using alpha-toxin from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This treatment rendered the surface membrane permeable to low-molecular-weight substances but left functional thromboxane A2 receptors. Tension measurements were used to investigate the effect of the stable thromboxane A2 analogue, U-46619, on the Ca2+ sensitivity of smooth muscle contractile proteins. U-46619 (1 nM to 1 microM) potentiated submaximal Ca(2+)-activated force (generated by [Ca2+], 50 nM to 3 microM) but not maximal Ca(2+)-activated force (generated by [Ca2+], 10-100 microM). The specific thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, GR-32191B (1 microM), inhibited the action of U-46619 (0.1 microM). The potentiation of submaximal Ca(2+)-activated force produced by the muscle in response to U-46619 (0.1 microM) was antagonized by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (1 mM), the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GDP, and mimicked by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (100 microM), the nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP.

1077,30410769.0,The influence of kinesiology tape colour on performance and corticomotor activity in healthy adults: a randomised crossover controlled trial.,BMC Sports Sci Med Rehabil,"BACKGROUND: There exists conflicting evidence regarding the impact of kinesiology tape on performance and muscle function. One variable that may account for disparities in the findings of previous studies is the colour of the tape applied. Colour is hypothesised to influence sporting performance through modulation of arousal and aggression. However, few studies have investigated the influence of colour on products designed specifically to enhance athletic performance. Further, no studies have investigated the potential influence of colour on other drivers of performance, such as corticomotor activity and neuromuscular function. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of kinesiology tape colour on athletic performance, knee extensor torque, and quadriceps neuromuscular function. METHODS: Thirty two healthy participants were assessed under five conditions, applied in random order: (1) no kinesiology tape (control), (2) beige-coloured kinesiology tape applied with tension (sham A), (3) beige-coloured kinesiology tape applied with no tension (sham B), (4) red-coloured kinesiology tape applied with tension, and (5) blue-coloured kinesiology tape applied with tension. Athletic performance was assessed using a previously validated hop test, knee extensor torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer, and transcranial magnetic stimulation was utilised to provide insight into the neuromuscular functioning of the quadriceps musculature. RESULTS: Kinesiology tape had no beneficial impact on lower limb performance or muscle strength in healthy adults. The colour of the tape did not influence athletic performance (F (4, 120) = 0.593, p = 0.669), quadriceps strength (F (4, 120) = 0.787, p = 0.536), or neuromuscular function (rectus femoris: F (2.661, 79.827) = 1.237, p = 0.301). CONCLUSION: This study found that kinesiology tape does not alter lower limb performance or muscle function in healthy adults, irrespective of the colour of the tape applied. Future research should seek to confirm these findings beyond the research setting, across a range of sports, and at a range of skill levels.

1078,17337898.0,Toward improved differential diagnosis of adductor spasmodic dysphonia and muscle tension dysphonia.,Folia Phoniatr Logop,"OBJECTIVE: Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) is characterized by a strained-strangled voice quality, whose diagnosis relies exclusively on auditory-perceptual features. However, muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) -- a functional voice disorder -- can mimic ADSD thereby contributing to diagnostic confusion. Unlike MTD, ADSD has been described as 'task-specific', implying that certain vocal tasks such as sentences loaded with predominantly voiced consonants will provoke greater sign expression. This investigation examined the diagnostic value of variable sign expression based upon phonetic loading as a means to disambiguate ADSD and MTD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five listeners, who were blinded to the purpose of the study, used a 10-cm visual analog scale to rate the dysphonia severity of two sentences (one all-voiced and one containing primarily voiceless consonants) produced by participants with ADSD (n = 29) or MTD (n = 33). RESULTS: A mixed-design ANOVA, with Group (ADSD vs. MTD) as the between-subjects variable and Sentence Type (all-voiced vs. voiceless) as the within-subjects variable, confirmed a significant Group-by-Sentence Type interaction effect (p = 0.0002). In ADSD, ratings of dysphonia severity for the all-voiced sentence were significantly more severe than for the voiceless sentence (p < 0.0001), whereas in MTD no significant difference was observed (p = 0.9981). The ROC curve confirmed that differences in dysphonia severity between voiced and voiceless sentences represented a highly specific (88-100%), but only 48% sensitive diagnostic marker. CONCLUSIONS: Phonetic loading influences sign expression in ADSD, and assists in discriminating ADSD from MTD.",2007,59,2,83-90,10.1159/000098341,#3763,Roy 2007,

Part 2: Characterization of Pathophysiology.,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,"Objective The purpose of this review is to describe the recent advances in characterizing spasmodic dysphonia. Spasmodic dysphonia is a task-specific focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by irregular and uncontrolled voice breaks. The pathophysiology is poorly understood, and there are diagnostic difficulties. Data Sources PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Review Methods The data sources were searched using the following search terms: ( spasmodic dysphonia or laryngeal dystonia) and ( etiology, aetiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, or pathophysiology). Conclusion The diagnosis of spasmodic dysphonia can be difficult due to the lack of a scientific consensus on diagnostic criteria and the fact that other voice disorders may present similarly. Confusion can arise between spasmodic dysphonia and muscle tension dysphonia. Spasmodic dysphonia symptoms are tied to particular speech sounds, whereas muscle tension dysphonia is not. With the advent of more widespread use of high-speed laryngoscopy and videokymography, measures of the disruptions in phonation and delays in the onset of vocal fold vibration after vocal fold closure can be quantified. Recent technological developments have expanded our understanding of the pathophysiology of spasmodic dysphonia. Implications for Practice A 3-tiered approach, involving a questionnaire, followed by speech assessment and nasolaryngoscopy is the most widely accepted method for making the diagnosis in most cases. More experimental and invasive techniques such as electromyography and neuroimaging have been explored to further characterize spasmodic dysphonia and aid in diagnosing difficult cases.",2017,157,4,558-564,10.1177/0194599817728465,#3764,Hintze 2017,characterization
1080,11530890.0,Spinal cord lesion: effects of and perspectives for treatment.,Neural Plast,"Following central motor lesions, two forms of adaptation can be observed which lead to improved mobility: (1) the development of spastic muscle tone, and (2) the activation of spinal locomotor centers induced by specific treadmill training. Tension development during spastic gait is different from that during normal gait and appears to be independent of exaggerated monosynaptic stretch reflexes. Exaggerated stretch reflexes are associated with an absence or reduction of functionally essential polysynaptic reflexes. When supraspinal control of spinal reflexes is impaired, the inhibition of monosynaptic reflexes is missing in addition to a reduced facilitation of polysynaptic reflexes. Therefore, overall leg muscle activity becomes reduced and less well modulated in patients with spasticity. Electrophysiological and histological studies have shown that a transformation of motor units takes place following central motor lesions with the consequence that regulation of muscle tone is achieved at a lower level of neuronal organization which in turn enables the patient to walk. Based on observations of the locomotor capacity of the spinal cat, recent studies have indicated that spinal locomotor centers can be activated and trained in patients with complete or incomplete paraplegia when the body is partially unloaded. However, the level of electromyographic activity in the gastrocnemius (the main antigravity muscle during gait) is considerably lower in the patients compared to healthy subjects. During the course of a daily locomotor training program, the amplitude of gastrocnemius, electromyographic activity increases significantly during the stance phase, while inappropriate tibialis anterior activation decreases. Patients with incomplete paraplegia benefit from such training programs such that their walking ability on a stationary surface improves. The pathophysiology and functional significance of spastic muscle tone and the effects of treadmill training on the locomotor pattern underlying new attempts to improve the mobility of patients with paraplegia are reviewed.",2001,8,2-Jan,83-90,10.1155/NP.2001.83,#3765,Dietz 2001,
1081,16224796.0,Comparison of the urethral properties of the female guinea pig and rat.,Neurourol Urodyn,"AIMS: The main focus of this study was to profile and compare urethral function in the female guinea pig and rat, and to characterize urodynamically distinctive patterns in the micturition cycle of the two species. This exercise aimed to investigate potential species-related differences and determine a suitable animal model for the human urethra. MATERIALS & METHODS: Female Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (400-500 g) and Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300 g) were used throughout the study. For in vitro experiments urethral rings were suspended vertically for isometric tension recording in 5 ml organ baths and drugs (phenylephrine 10(-4) M and carbachol 10(-4) M) were applied directly to the bathing solution. In vivo urethral pull-through and urodynamic studies were performed under urethane anesthesia, and phenylephrine (200 microg/kg) was administered during urethral pull-through experiments via the intravenous (i.v.) route. Urethral, bladder and arterial pressures, and external urethral sphincter electromyographic (EMG) spike activity were recorded simultaneously throughout. RESULTS: Organ bath studies coupled with in vivo pull-through experiments produced urethral profiles with distinct regional variations for both species. Urodynamic studies with the urethral probe fixed in the high pressure zones of the proximal urethra produced similar recordings in both species during bladder filling and marked differences during micturition. The guinea pig showed complete sphincteric inhibition immediately prior and during micturition as also seen in the human, whereas the rat exhibited high frequency bursts in EMG activity at this stage in the cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The EMG activity seen in the rat during micturition is presumably necessary for efficient voiding, thus the guinea pig is a more suitable comparative model for the human in relation to urethral properties during micturition.",2006,25,1,62-9,10.1002/nau.20194,#3766,Walters 2006,

1083,3597170.0,A comparison of three approaches for the determination of baseline levels of physiological activity.,Int J Psychophysiol,"The traditional means of determining baseline levels of physiological activity in research evaluating responses to stressful stimuli has been to record activity during rest periods either before or interspersed with periods of stimulation. Subjects may, however, anticipate the impending stimulation, thus elevating their levels of physiological activity even during periods of presumed rest. Eight physiological responses--forehead muscle tension, heart rate, heart rate variability, skin resistance level and non-specific responses, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse transit time--were recorded from 39 subjects during sessions which included both task and rest periods, and during sessions with only rest periods and periods of viewing slides of restful scenery. The results indicate a significant decrease in levels of physiological activity in most of the 8 physiological measures when activity was recorded during sessions in which no tasks were presented. The lowest levels of physiological activity were recorded while subjects viewed slides. These results suggest that the traditional approach to the determination of baseline may yield levels of physiological activity contaminated by anticipation of upcoming stimuli.",1987,5,1,53-61,10.1016/0167-8760(87)90072-9,#3768,Whitsett 1987,

Retention is defined as preventing donors from lapsing and eventually becoming inactive. This review paper discusses literature on the importance of efforts to retain donors, specifically new donors, since lapsing is most common before the fifth donation. Studies have found that intention to donate, attitudes towards blood donation and self-efficacy (does one feel capable of donating blood) are predictors of blood donation. Feelings of 'warm glow' predict donation behaviour better than altruism. The existing literature further suggests that first time donors can be retained by paying extra attention to adverse events (vasovagal reactions and fatigue). These events could be reduced by drinking water and muscle tension exercises. Feelings of anxiety (in regular donors) and stress can further prevent donors from returning. Planning donations amongst busy lives can help retention, and suggestions are given on which interventions might be helpful.",2015,25,4,227-33,10.1111/tme.12249,#3769,vanDongen 2015,donor
1085,17901731.0,Optimizing the use of local muscle flaps for knee megaprosthesis coverage.,Ann Plast Surg,"Primary muscle flap cover of megaprostheses following limb salvage surgery for tumors around the knee serves to decrease infection rates, provide additional soft tissue cover over the implant, and act as a bed for split-skin grafting. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the role of supplementary muscle flaps such as the hemisoleus, gracilis, and semimembranosus in augmenting coverage provided by gastrocnemius muscle flaps. Between August 1999 and August 2006, 10 patients underwent resection of distal femur (n = 5) or proximal tibia (n = 5) sarcomas, followed by bone reconstruction with a modular megaprosthesis and soft tissue coverage with local pedicled flaps. The average age was 31 years (range, 13 to 47), with pathologic diagnoses inclusive of osteosarcoma (n = 7), chondrosarcoma (n = 2), and recurrent giant cell tumor (n = 1). For proximal tibial tumors, both bellies of the gastrocnemius with hemisoleus for additional soft tissue cover were used. For distal femoral tumors, 1 gastrocnemius belly sutured to the extensor mechanism and gracilis or semimembranosus provided adequate soft tissue cover. All flaps survived without complications, all wounds healed well, and all patients were ambulant after surgery. The role of supplementary muscle flaps was demonstrated in specific situations, where coverage of the subcutaneous area of the midtibia was deficient and where a significant amount of the vastus medialis or gastrocnemius has been resected. Technical refinements included primary skin grafting to relieve tension during skin closure and excision of the aponeurosis over the gastrocnemius and hemisoleus to increase the reach and surface area of the muscle flap.",2007,59,4,398-403,10.1097/01.sap.0000258955.27987.17,#3770,Chim 2007,
1086,30572760.0,Elevated Wall Tension Leads to Reduced miR-133a in the Thoracic Aorta by Exosome Release.,J Am Heart Assoc,"Background Reduced miR-133a was previously found to be associated with thoracic aortic ( TA ) dilation, as seen in aneurysm disease. Because wall tension increases with vessel diameter (Law of Laplace), this study tested the hypothesis that elevated tension led to the reduction of miR-133a in the TA . Methods and Results Elevated tension (1.5 g; 150 mm Hg) applied to murine TA ex vivo reduced miR-133a tissue abundance compared with TA held at normotension (0.7 g; 70 mm Hg). Cellular miR-133a levels were reduced with biaxial stretch of isolated murine TA fibroblasts, whereas smooth muscle cells were not affected. Mechanisms contributing to the loss of miR-133a abundance were further investigated in TA fibroblasts. Biaxial stretch did not reduce primary miR-133a transcription and had no effect on the expression/abundance of 3 micro RNA -specific exoribonucleases. Remarkably, biaxial stretch increased exosome secretion, and exosomes isolated from TA fibroblasts contained more miR-133a. Inhibition of exosome secretion prevented the biaxial stretch-induced reduction of miR-133a. Subsequently, 2 in vivo models of hypertension were used to determine the effect of elevated wall tension on miR-133a abundance in the TA : wild-type mice with osmotic pump-mediated angiotensin II infusion and angiotensin II -independent spontaneously hypertensive mice. Interestingly, the abundance of miR-133a was decreased in TA tissue and increased in the plasma in both models of hypertension compared with a normotensive control group. Furthermore, miR-133a was elevated in the plasma of hypertensive human subjects, compared with normotensive patients. Conclusions Taken together, these results identified exosome secretion as a tension-sensitive mechanism by which miR-133a abundance was reduced in TA fibroblasts.",2019,8,1,e010332,10.1161/JAHA.118.010332,#3771,Akerman 2019,exosome secretion

METHODS: Investigation has been based on the mandible geometry reconstructed with use of hospitalized patient CT data. The KLS Martin mini-plates with corresponding screws were used to establish proper fracture stabilization. Models were run assuming isotropic and elasto-plastic material properties of connecting devices and cortical bone. The main masticatory muscles and artificial temporomandibular joint have been incorporated to assure mandible physiological movement. The gage loading has been applied in three different locations to cover wider range of possible mastication loading cases during daily routine. A different contact conditions have been applied to the fracture plane to simulate both load bearing and sharing behaviors. Prepared FEM models reflect the most frequently used surgery's approaches to mandible angle fracture treatment. A specific nomenclature has been introduced to describe particular model. The tension plate, with one connecting mini-plate, two-point fixation and combined fixation, both using two mini-plates respectively. RESULTS: Performed analysis allowed for a detailed estimation of the mini-plate connection response under the applied gauge loading.

This paper describes a constitutive modeling approach quantifying the relationship between vocal fold stress and strain (or stretch), and establishes predictions of F(0) with the string model of phonation based on the constitutive parameters. Results indicated that transient and time-dependent changes in F(0), including global declinations in declarative sentences, as well as local F(0) overshoots and undershoots, can be partially attributed to the time-dependent viscoplastic response of the vocal fold cover.",2009,34,4,181-9,10.3109/14015430902913501,#3775,Chan 2009,
1091,33496487.0,Implant of Self-Expandable Artificial Anal Sphincter in Patients With Fecal Incontinence Improves External Anal Sphincter Contractility.,Dis Colon Rectum,"BACKGROUND: External anal sphincter contractility significantly contributes to control the passage of stool. An artificial anal sphincter placed into the intersphincteric space is a safe and effective procedure to treat fecal incontinence, even if its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate external anal sphincter contractility changes after a self-expandable hyexpan prostheses was implanted into the intersphincteric space of the anal canal and clinical outcomes compared. DESIGN: This was a prospective clinical study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients affected by fecal incontinence for at least 6 months after failure of conservative treatment were included. INTERVENTIONS: All of the patients underwent 10-prostheses implantation and were examined preoperatively and postoperatively by endoanal ultrasound and anorectal manometry. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Fecal incontinence symptoms were assessed by severity scores. The external anal sphincter muscle tension was calculated using a specific equation. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (34 women; median age = 68 y) were included in the study; no morbidity was registered. After a median follow-up period of 14 months, both the median maximum voluntary squeeze pressure and the median inner radius of the external anal sphincter significantly increased. A statistically significant increase of external anal sphincter muscle tension was detected. A decrease of any fecal incontinence symptom and an improvement in severity scores were observed at the last follow-up examination. The external anal sphincter contractility was significantly higher in patients reducing incontinence episodes to solid stool by >50% and improving their ability to defer defecation for >15 minutes. LIMITATIONS: This was a single-center experience with a relatively small and heterogeneous sample size, patients with a potentially more severe disease because our institution is a referral center, and an absence of quality-of-life evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial anal sphincter implantation improved the external anal sphincter muscle tension; there was a positive correlation between its increase and the clinical outcome.

1092,16169149.0,Objective analysis of mechanical resistance of tension-free devices.,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"INTRODUCTION: The ""tension-free"" procedures are widely used by surgeons for the treatment of urinary incontinence and prolapse. The clinical results are largely in favour of these procedures. The aim of our study is to determine objectively the mechanical tissue resistance when using these techniques, before healing begins. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We measured the mechanical resistance using four different routes: the retro-pubic space, the transobturator, the translevator ani muscle and the trans-sacrospinous ligament. We compared five different meshes, TVT, IVS, Lift, Prolene and Prolene Soft. In order to study the effect of increasing dimensions, we tested Prolene tapes measuring 1, 1.5 and 2 cm in width. We performed traction tests on meshes implanted in cadavers. Measurements were made with a dynamometer and the results expressed in Newtons. RESULTS: This study shows that TVT offers a better resistance to traction via the retro-pubic space route. There was no significant difference among the four routes when the same type of mesh measuring 1cm was used. However, an increase in the dimensions of Prolene tapes improves their resistance in the tissues, thereby facilitating fixation before healing begins. Also, these increasing dimensions (in width) show that there is better resistance with the trans-sacrospinous ligament compared with the transmuscular one. DISCUSSION: The increasing size of prosthetic meshes does not show the superiority of certain routes with commercial meshes of 1cm in width. The higher resistance obtained with wider tapes is probably due to an increased surface area between the tissues and meshes. This increase in resistance does not seem to be important for the treatment of urinary incontinence. However, it should be of interest for the treatment of prolapse where traction and surface are more important. CONCLUSION: Two different recommendations can be deduced from our study. On one hand, the arms of prosthetic meshes for pelvic floor repair should measure more than 1cm in width in order to improve their maintenance in the tissues in the immediate post-operative period. On the other hand to improve fixation, the posterior arms of the transperineal mesh should be passed through the sacrospinous ligament rather than via the transmuscular route. The resistance of tissues is also influenced by the armature of the prosthetic mesh. They must therefore be developed commercially specifically for ""tension-free"" fixation. Our results need to be confirmed by further studies including more cadavers and younger patients.",2006,124,2,240-5,10.1016/j.ejogrb.2005.06.040,#3777,Boukerrou 2006,
1093,25168295.0,Trigger point injections for headache disorders: expert consensus methodology and narrative review.,Headache,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: To review the existing literature and describe a standardized methodology by expert consensus for the performance of trigger point injections (TPIs) in the treatment of headache disorders. Despite their widespread use, the efficacy, safety, and methodology of TPIs have not been reviewed specifically for headache disorders by expert consensus. METHODS: The Peripheral Nerve Blocks and Other Interventional Procedures Special Interest Section of the American Headache Society over a series of meetings reached a consensus for nomenclature, indications, contraindications, precautions, procedural details, outcomes, and adverse effects for the use of TPIs for headache disorders. A subcommittee of the Section also reviewed the literature. RESULTS: Indications for TPIs may include many types of episodic and chronic primary and secondary headache disorders, with the presence of active trigger points (TPs) on physical examination. Contraindications may include infection, a local open skull defect, or an anesthetic allergy, and precautions are necessary in the setting of anticoagulant use, pregnancy, and obesity with unclear anatomical landmarks. The most common muscles selected for TPIs include the trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and temporalis, with bupivacaine and lidocaine the agents used most frequently. Adverse effects are typically mild with careful patient and procedural selection, though pneumothorax and other serious adverse events have been infrequently reported. CONCLUSIONS: When performed in the appropriate setting and with the proper expertise, TPIs seem to have a role in the adjunctive treatment of the most common headache disorders.

Furthermore, the plasma Mg concentration (0.8 to 1.1 mmol.L-1) is only equivalent to one percent of the total body content. A Mg deficit may exist while plasma Mg concentration is normal. Therefore other techniques for Mg assessment, such as the repletion test, as well as red blood cell and lymphocyte concentrations have been used. A renewed interest for Mg occurred as numerous studies have shown the therapeutic efficiency of Mg and as the mechanisms of its haemodynamic effects have been recognized. Mg regulates Na-K-ATPase activity, K channels activity and, most of all, it is a natural calcium channel blocking agent. These properties explain its important place in electrophysiology of myocardial cells and the effects on the tension of smooth muscles, resulting in a vasodilation and a bronchodilation respectively. The antagonistic effect of Mg on calcium decreases the presynaptic release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and the release of epinephrine at the peripheral sympathetic nerves and the adrenals. Mg potentiates the effect of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. A Mg deficiency occurs often in ICU patients, in alcoholics and during use of diuretics. Simultaneous administration of Mg is often required for treatment of potassium deficiency. Mg has an anti-arrhythmic effect towards digoxin-mediated dysrhythmias and torsades de pointes, and can be efficient in other arrhythmias. Systematic use of Mg seems to decrease mortality of acute myocardial infarction and is justified during cardiac surgery, often associated with hypomagnesemia, because of vasodilation of coronary arteries and in order to prevent occurrence of arrhythmias. Mg, because of its calcium channel blocking properties and as it lowers the release of epinephrine, is indicated for surgery of pheochromocytoma. In eclamptic and pre-eclamptic patients, the use of Mg is valuable, but not as an anti-epileptic agent. Other clinical uses of Mg have been proposed, but they are either anecdotal or of uncertain efficiency.",1995,14,5,406-16,10.1016/s0750-7658(05)80393-4,#3779,Delhumeau 1995,

A randomized clinical comparative study].,Z Psychosom Med Psychoanal,"The study compares in a randomized clinical control-group design with a waiting list-and acupuncture therapy control-group the short term (three months) effectiveness of a newly developed psychological biobehavioral treatment program in 30 chronic migraine patients. The results show a significant reduction of vascular and tension related headache-frequency and intensity (primary outcome criteria) in both the acupuncture and psychological treatment condition. The waiting list control-group remained almost unchanged over the whole observation period. The improvement in both treatment conditions remained stable throughout the post therapy period to the three months follow-up, but only the psychological treatment condition revealed a highly significant reduction in the use of all kinds of medication in comparison to the pre-treatment period. Single case analyses showed a slight superiority of the psychological treatment condition over the acupuncture therapy due to a more generalized improvement in all secondary outcome variables (psychological restrictions in every day life, medication, duration of headache). The effect of specific components of the psychological treatment program are examined and possible general implication for a treatment of severely disturbed chronic migraine patients are discussed.",1985,31,3,247-66,,#3780,Doerr-Proske 1985,

A decrease in headache intensity, frequency, headache-specific impairment, depression, and change of pain-related cognitions was expected. BACKGROUND: The efficacy of CBT for primary headaches has been confirmed in research, yet the translation into clinical practice has remained untested thus far. DESIGN: In this single-group outcome study, 87 headache patients diagnosed with migraine and/or tension-type headache received (1) headache-specific medication for 10 weeks and (2) a subsequent CBT treatment made up of 13 individual and 12 group sessions consisting of psychoeducation, progressive muscle relaxation, coping strategies for pain and stress, and goal setting skills. Booster group sessions after 3 and 6 months were implemented to stimulate individual goal attainment, and follow-up measures were recorded up to 12 months. RESULTS: A significant decrease was found for all primary and secondary outcome criteria, ie, average headache intensity (prae M: 6.0, standard deviation [SD]: 1.5 vs follow-up [FU] 1 year M: 5.1, SD: 1.9), headache frequency (prae M: 16.0, SD: 9.5 vs FU 1 year M: 13.4, SD: 9.9), and catastrophizing (prae M: 3.4, SD: 1.0 vs FU 1 year M: 2.6, SD: 1.1). Coping strategies were increased (prae M: 3.4, SD: .9 vs FU 1 year M: 4.0, SD: 1.0).

1097,22564548.0,"Autonomic dysfunction: a unifying multiple sclerosis theory, linking chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, vitamin D(3), and Epstein-Barr virus.",Autoimmun Rev,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease with multiple etiologies. The most recent theory of the vascular etiology of MS, Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI), suggests that cerebral venous obstruction could lead to cerebral venous reflux, promoting local inflammatory processes. This review article offers strong evidence that the route of the observed narrowing of cerebral veins arises from autonomic nervous system dysfunction, particularly cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. The dysfunction of this system has two major effects: 1) the reduction of mean arterial blood pressure, which has the potential to reduce the cerebral perfusion pressure and the transmural pressure, and 2) the failure of cerebral autoregulation to maintain constant cerebral blood flow in the face of fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure. Alterations in cerebral autoregulation could in turn raise the critical closure pressure, indicated to be the cerebral perfusion pressure at which the transmural pressure will be sub-sufficient to overcome the active tension imparted by the smooth muscle layer of the vessel. These two effects of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (reduction in arterial blood pressure and alterations in cerebral autoregulation), when combined with inflammation-induced high levels of nitric oxide in the brain, will lower transmural pressure sufficiently to the point where the threshold for critical closure pressure is reached, leading to venous closure. In addition, cerebral vessels fail to overcome the closure as a result of low central venous pressure, which is also regulated by autonomic nervous system function. Furthermore, through their neuroregulatory effects, infectious agents such as the Epstein-Barr virus and vitamin D(3) are able to alter the functions of the autonomic nervous system, influencing the rate of CCSVI occurrence. The absence of CCSVI specificity for MS, observed in recent clinical studies, may stem from a high prevalence of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in control groups which were recruited to these studies. Future studies should investigate CCSVI in relation to cardiovascular autonomic function.",2012,12,2,250-9,10.1016/j.autrev.2012.04.004,#3782,Sternberg 2012,

1099,25209445.0,Clinical observation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in treatment for sequelae of thoracolumbar spinal cord injury.,J Transl Med,"BACKGROUND: Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) have a considerable advantage and potential in treating for central nervous system diseases and have become a novel alternative treatment for spinal cord injury. This study aims to compare the neurological function outcome of stem cell transplantation, rehabilitation therapy, and self-healing for sequelae of spinal cord injury. METHODS: Thirty-four cases of thoracolumbar spinal cord injury were randomly divided into three groups: the stem cell transplantation group was given CT-guided UCMSC transplantation twice; the rehabilitation group received rehabilitation therapy; and the blank control group did not receive any specific treatment. AIS grading, ASIA scoring, the manual muscle strength and muscle tension scale, and the Barthel index were used to evaluate the clinical outcome. Urodynamic examination was also performed for patients in the UCMSC group and the rehabilitation therapy group. RESULTS: Seven of the ten patients in the UCMSC group had significant and stable improvement in movement, self-care ability, and muscular tension; five of the forteen patients (36%) in the rehabilitation group also had certain improvement in these aspects. Urodynamic examination demonstrated that patients in the UCMSC group exhibited an increase in maximum urinary flow rate and maximum bladder capacity, as well as a decrease in residue urine volume and maximum detrusor pressure. The rehabilitation group exhibited decreased maximum bladder capacity, but no perceptible change in maximum urinary flow rate, residue urine volume or maximum detrusor pressure. CONCLUSIONS: UCMSC transplantation can effectively improve neurological functional recovery after spinal cord injury, and its efficacy is superior to that of rehabilitation therapy and self-healing.

1100,23475211.0,Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) is co-localized with key proteins of the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP signaling in the human prostate.,World J Urol,"PURPOSE: Experimental studies have provided the basis for the evaluation of inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptomatology (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It has been speculated that the clinical efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors in patients with LUTS/BPH can be explained by their effects on the urinary bladder rather than on the prostate. Hence, the significance of the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic GMP signaling in the control of the human prostate requires further clarification. METHODS: The present study aimed to investigate by means of immunohistochemistry in the human prostate the expression and distribution of key mediators of the NO pathway, namely cyclic GMP, the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and cyclic GMP-binding protein kinases type I (cGKIα, cGKIß), in relation to PDE5, protein kinase A (cAK), and the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). RESULTS: In the smooth muscle portion of the transition zone, immunosignals specific for the PDE5 were found co-localized with cyclic GMP, cGKIα, and cGKIß, as well as with the cyclic cAMP-binding protein kinase A. Smooth muscle bundles were seen innervated by slender varicose nerves characterized by the expression of nNOS. Some of these nerves also presented staining related to the neuropeptide VIP. CONCLUSIONS: The findings give hints that the cyclic GMP- and cyclic AMP-dependent signal transduction may synergistically work together in regulating muscle tension in the transition zone. This might be of significance for the identification of new pharmacological avenues to treat patients with symptomatic BPH.",2013,31,3,609-14,10.1007/s00345-013-1048-9,#3785,Ãckert 2013,
1101,22552730.0,Bladder selectivity of the novel β₃-agonist ritobegron (KUC-7483) explored by in vitro and in vivo studies in the rat.,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,"We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to evaluate the pharmacological profile of ritobegron and its effects on the bladder in rats. β(3)-AR selectivity was assessed using CHO cells expressing various subtypes of the human β-adrenoceptor (AR). Effects on isolated organs were evaluated using the organ-bath method. Effects on intravesical pressure, heart rate, and mean blood pressure were evaluated in urethane-anesthetized rats. Ritobegron increased cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner in CHO cells expressing any one of three human β-AR, its selectivity for β(3)-AR being 301-fold and 32-fold higher versus β(1)-AR and β(2)-AR, respectively. Ritobegron decreased the resting tension of the isolated bladder in a concentration-dependent manner (EC(50), 7.7 × 10(-8) mol/L; maximal relaxation, 97.0 %), and the β(3)-AR antagonist SR58894A produced a parallel rightward-shift of this concentration-response curve without altering the maximal response [pK(B) value, 6.43]. Ritobegron concentration-dependently increased atrial rate and decreased myometrial contractions in vitro, and its selectivity for the bladder was 2,078-fold higher versus the atria and 14-fold higher versus the uterus. In vivo, ritobegron induced a dose-dependent decrease in intravesical pressure (ED(50) 0.4 mg/kg), without affecting heart rate and only slightly lowering mean blood pressure. Thus, ritobegron displayed potent and selective β(3)-AR agonistic activity toward transfected human β-AR and exhibited a high selectivity for the bladder versus other organs in rats. Moreover, it decreased intravesical pressure with minimal effects on the cardiovascular system in anesthetized rats. These results suggest that ritobegron shows promise as a potential agent for the treatment of overactive bladder.",2012,385,8,845-52,10.1007/s00210-012-0755-x,#3786,Maruyama 2012,

The goal of the study was to determine the efficacy of hippotherapy in patients with coxarthrosis, according to functional and biomechanical parameters. Hippotherapy involves the utilization of horseback riding to stimulate the patient's normal reactions and locomotion; to improve the balance and coordination of movement, normalize muscle tension, and eliminate pathological reflexes. The advantage of the hippotherapy is in the specific posture, which is adopted by hip joint at the time of riding and in movement, which is accomplished by rider, at different paces of the horse. 10 female patients from 14 to 32 years old with coxarthrosis were under the observation. The rehabilitation of the patients was carried out by means of hippotherapy, which consisted of three months riding three times a week. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment, a new method of biomechanical registration of hip joint movement during hippotherapy on pacing horse was developed. The dynamics of biomechanical curves before and after the treatment, as well as the clinical and functional parameters of the patients allowed the authors to conclude: hippotherapy improves a hip joint functional state in patients with coxarthrosis; improves the muscle-tendineous component of hip joint movement. Hippotherapy may be considered as the pathogenetic method of treatment of coxarthrosis. Drawing the biomechanical curve of hip joint movement at the time of riding is the objective method of studying its function.",2008,,155,26-31,,#3788,Nareklishvili 2008,

Studies comparing various techniques are reviewed, as well as previous literature reviews evaluating the effects of individual techniques. There is evidence that cognitively oriented methods have specific cognitive effects, that specific autonomic effects result from autonomically oriented methods, and that specific muscular effects are produced by muscularly oriented methods. Muscle relaxation and/or EMG biofeedback have greater muscular effects and smaller autonomic effects than finger temperature biofeedback and/or autogenic training. EMG biofeedback produces greater effects on particular muscular groups than progressive relaxation, and thermal biofeedback has greater finger temperature effects than autogenic training. Disorders with a predominant muscular component (e.g., tension headaches) are treated more effectively by muscularly oriented methods, while disorders in which autonomic dysfunction predominates (e.g., hypertension, migraine headaches) are more effectively treated by techniques with a strong autonomic component.

DESIGN/METHODS: A systematic review identified relevant randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of children, adults, or both with high levels of needle fear, including phobia (if not available, then populations with other specific phobias were included). Critically important outcomes were self-reported fear specific to the feared situation and stimulus (psychological interventions) or fainting (applied muscle tension). Data were pooled using standardized mean difference (SMD) or relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The systematic review included 11 trials. In vivo exposure-based therapy for children 7 years and above showed benefit on specific fear (n=234; SMD: -1.71 [95% CI: -2.72, -0.7]). In vivo exposure-based therapy with adults reduced fear of needles posttreatment (n=20; SMD: -1.09 [-2.04, -0.14]) but not at 1-year follow-up (n=20; SMD: -0.28 [-1.16, 0.6]).

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in patients with TTH. METHOD: We performed a systematic review according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration. Randomised trials reporting conservative treatments in patients with TTH with headache as outcome were included. In the analysis studies were grouped according to type of intervention: acute pain medication, preventive medication, physiotherapy interventions, behavioural interventions and interventions in children. RESULTS: A total of 152 trials were included in this review with 17.523 patients, of which 37 studies (24.3%) were considered to be of high quality. Nine studies could not be included in one of the five subgroups. ACUTE MEDICATION: (41 trials). The pooled analyses showed that NSAIDs and acetaminophen are more effective than placebo. No significant differences could be found between different types of NSAIDs, but ibuprofen showed fewer short-term side effects when compared to other NSAIDs. There was a significant difference in favour of NSAIDs when compared to acetaminophen. PREVENTIVE MEDICATION: (44 trials). Overall, the use of antidepressants does not show to be more effective than placebo, and no significant differences between different types of antidepressants were found. Furthermore there is limited evidence concerning the negative effects of propranolol on depression in TTH patients, when compared to placebo or biofeedback. There is conflicting evidence about the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and vasodilator agents compared to placebo. There is no evidence concerning the effectiveness of muscle relaxants compared to placebo. BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY: (44 trials). Eight studies compared relaxation treatment with a waiting list or attention placebo control, and 11 studies compared EMG biofeedback with placebo and in both interventions we found inconsistent results. Most trials lack adequate power to show statistical significant differences, but frequently recovery/improvement rates did not reach clinical relevance. PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS: (12 trials). A wide variety of interventions were evaluated, such as spinal manipulations, exercise and physical applications. Overall the studies showed inconsistent results. CHILDREN: (11 trials). Eight studies evaluated the effectiveness of relaxation training. We found conflicting evidence for relaxation therapy compared with no treatment or other treatments. CONCLUSION: The evidence in this review suggests that NSAIDs and acetaminophen are both effective for short-term pain relief in patients with TTH. No specific type of NSAID was clearly more effective than others, but ibuprofen showed fewer side effects. There is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the effectiveness of preventive medication, physiotherapy, (spinal) manipulation, EMG biofeedback or cognitive behavioural treatment in patients with TTH.",2010,154,,A1924,,#3791,Verhagen 2010,

Musculoskeletal human models for dynamic simulation have been utilized to understand body kinetics including joint moments, muscle tension, and knee contact forces. The objectives of this study were to develop a knee contact model which can predict knee contact forces using an inverse dynamics-based optimization solver and to investigate the effect of joint constraints on knee contact force prediction. A knee contact model was developed to include 32 reaction force elements on the surface of a tibial insert of a total knee replacement (TKR), which was embedded in a full-body musculoskeletal model. Various external measurements including motion data and external force data during walking trials of a subject with an instrumented knee implant were provided from the Sixth Grand Challenge Competition to Predict in vivo Knee Loads. Knee contact forces in the medial and lateral portions of the instrumented knee implant were also provided for the same walking trials. A knee contact model with a hinge joint and normal alignment could predict knee contact forces with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 165 N and 288 N for the medial and lateral portions of the knee, respectively, and coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.70 and -0.63. When the degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of the knee and locations of leg markers were adjusted to account for the valgus lower-limb alignment of the subject, RMSE values improved to 144 N and 179 N, and R2 values improved to 0.77 and 0.37, respectively. The proposed knee contact model with subject-specific joint model could predict in vivo knee contact forces with reasonable accuracy. This model may contribute to the development and improvement of knee arthroplasty.",2016,138,2,21016,10.1115/1.4032414,#3792,Jung 2016,
1108,27918306.0,Targeting integrin α5β1 ameliorates severe airway hyperresponsiveness in experimental asthma.,J Clin Invest,"Treatment options are limited for severe asthma, and the need for additional therapies remains great. Previously, we demonstrated that integrin αvβ6-deficient mice are protected from airway hyperresponsiveness, due in part to increased expression of the murine ortholog of human chymase. Here, we determined that chymase protects against cytokine-enhanced bronchoconstriction by cleaving fibronectin to impair tension transmission in airway smooth muscle (ASM). Additionally, we identified a pathway that can be therapeutically targeted to mitigate the effects of airway hyperresponsiveness. Administration of chymase to human bronchial rings abrogated IL-13-enhanced contraction, and this effect was not due to alterations in calcium homeostasis or myosin light chain phosphorylation. Rather, chymase cleaved fibronectin, inhibited ASM adhesion, and attenuated focal adhesion phosphorylation. Disruption of integrin ligation with an RGD-containing peptide abrogated IL-13-enhanced contraction, with no further effect from chymase. We identified α5β1 as the primary fibronectin-binding integrin in ASM, and α5β1-specific blockade inhibited focal adhesion phosphorylation and IL-13-enhanced contraction, with no additional effect from chymase. Delivery of an α5β1 inhibitor into murine airways abrogated the exaggerated bronchoconstriction induced by allergen sensitization and challenge. Finally, α5β1 blockade enhanced the effect of the bronchodilator isoproterenol on airway relaxation. Our data identify the α5β1 integrin as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the severity of airway contraction in asthma.",2017,127,1,365-374,10.1172/JCI88555,#3793,Sundaram 2017,

1111,11173939.0,Autoradiographic localisation and contractile properties of prostatic endothelin receptors in patients with bladder outlet obstruction.,Eur Urol,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have used endothelin (ET) receptor agonists and antagonists to localise ET receptor subtypes in prostatic tissue. We have utilised high affinity ET(A) ([(125)I]PD151242) and ET(B) ([(125)I]BQ3020) receptor-specific radioligands to determine the density and distribution of ET receptor subtypes in prostatic tissues obtained from patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The contractile properties of the ET receptor subtypes as well as the effect of ET-1 on alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-mediated prostatic smooth muscle contraction were assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Saturation binding and quantitative autoradiographic studies were performed using specific radioligands for ET(A) and ET(B) receptors on prostate sections obtained from patients with bladder outflow obstruction secondary to BPH. In vitro isometric tension studies were carried out to characterise the ET receptor subtypes in prostatic smooth muscle strips from the same group of patients. In addition, the effect of ET-1 on alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-induced prostatic smooth muscle contraction was also investigated. RESULTS: There were dense ET(A) and ET(B) receptor-binding sites in the prostatic stroma. ET(A) receptor-binding sites were also prominent on the prostatic epithelium. ET-1 and sarafotoxin 6 c (ET(B) receptor agonist) elicited prostatic smooth muscle contraction (-log EC(50) 8.31+/-0.15 and 8.22+/-0.22 M, respectively). Both BQ123 (ET(A) antagonist) and BQ788 (ET(B) antagonist) significantly inhibited ET-1- and S6c-mediated prostatic smooth muscle contractile responses, respectively. ET-1 at sub-threshold concentrations significantly enhanced alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-mediated prostatic smooth muscle contractile responses. CONCLUSIONS: ET(A) receptor-binding sites are prominent in both prostatic stroma and epithelium, whereas ET(B) receptor-binding sites were predominantly seen in the prostatic stroma in symptomatic BPH.

1113,3378055.0,The major anoxic stress response protein p34 is a distinct lactate dehydrogenase.,Biochemistry,"Anoxic stress is a common physiological stress, but one with unusual and significant consequences. Anoxic stress results in efficient induction of gene amplification and also plays a controlling role in the production of angiogenesis factor by macrophages. Within tumor masses, cancer cells continue to proliferate under oxygen tensions substantially lower than seen in normal tissues. The molecular basis of the anoxic stress response has not been well characterized. The major anoxic stress protein in subconfluent cell cultures is a 34-kilodalton polypeptide which has been variously reported to be either a new isozyme of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or the conventional muscle-type lactate dehydrogenase. This protein is of particular interest since it is also found expressed at high levels in many human cancers and has been demonstrated to be an effective serum cancer marker. We have developed an affinity chromatography procedure for purification of the anoxic stress protein p34 which effectively separates this protein from LDH-5 as well as other standard LDH isozymes. Anoxic stress protein p34 was found to specifically interact with flavins and the cellular alarmone guanosine(5')tetraphospho(5')guanosine, and also to interact with certain nucleic acids. The properties of this protein suggest that its overall role in the anoxic stress response may be in the coordination of a number of cellular systems.",1988,27,6,2187-93,10.1021/bi00406a056,#3798,Anderson 1988,

Here, we describe developmentally inspired methods for the derivation of skeletal muscle cells and their utility in skeletal muscle tissue engineering with the aim to model skeletal muscle regeneration and dystrophy in vitro. METHODS: Key steps include the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to embryonic muscle progenitors followed by primary and secondary foetal myogenesis into three-dimensional muscle. To simulate Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell line was compared to a CRISPR/Cas9-edited isogenic control line. RESULTS: The established skeletal muscle differentiation protocol robustly and faithfully recapitulates critical steps of embryonic myogenesis in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cultures, resulting in functional human skeletal muscle organoids (SMOs) and engineered skeletal muscles (ESMs) with a regeneration-competent satellite-like cell pool. Tissue-engineered muscle exhibits organotypic maturation and function (up to 5.7 ± 0.5 mN tetanic twitch tension at 100 Hz in ESM). Contractile performance could be further enhanced by timed thyroid hormone treatment, increasing the speed of contraction (time to peak contraction) as well as relaxation (time to 50% relaxation) of single twitches from 107 ± 2 to 75 ± 4 ms (P < 0.05) and from 146 ± 6 to 100 ± 6 ms (P < 0.05), respectively. Satellite-like cells could be documented as largely quiescent PAX7(+) cells (75 ± 6% Ki67(-) ) located adjacent to muscle fibres confined under a laminin-containing basal membrane. Activation of the engineered satellite-like cell niche was documented in a cardiotoxin injury model with marked recovery of contractility to 57 ± 8% of the pre-injury force 21 days post-injury (P < 0.05 compared to Day 2 post-injury), which was completely blocked by preceding irradiation. Absence of dystrophin in DMD ESM caused a marked reduction of contractile force (-35 ± 7%, P < 0.05) and impaired expression of fast myosin isoforms resulting in prolonged contraction (175 ± 14 ms, P < 0.05 vs. gene-edited control) and relaxation (238 ± 22 ms, P < 0.05 vs. gene-edited control) times. Restoration of dystrophin levels by gene editing rescued the DMD phenotype in ESM. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce human muscle models with canonical properties of bona fide skeletal muscle in vivo to study muscle development, maturation, disease and repair.",2022,,,,10.1002/jcsm.13094,#3799,Shahriyari 2022,Duchenne muscular dystrophy
1115,36250635.0,Selective reduction of neurotransmitter release by cAMP-dependent pathways in mouse detrusor.,Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,"Parasympathetic nerve-mediated contractions of detrusor smooth muscle are generated by ATP and ACh release from efferent nerve terminals. In humans, ACh is responsible for detrusor contractions in normal human bladders, whereas ATP has an additional role in overactive bladder pathologies. The ATP metabolite, adenosine, relaxes nerve-mediated contractions, with a potential action via presynaptic adenosine A(1) receptor activation and subsequent suppression of neuronal ATP release. We investigated the effect of A(1) receptor activation and downstream cAMP-dependent pathways on nerve-mediated ATP and ACh release, and detrusor contraction in mouse detrusor. Bladders from male C57BL/6 mice (12 weeks) were used. Upon electrical field stimulation of intact preparations (detrusor and mucosal layers), ATP or ACh release was measured simultaneously with tension recordings. Activation of A(1) receptors by adenosine or exogenous agonists reduced the lower frequency component of nerve-mediated contractions, and neuronal ATP release. The A(1) receptor antagonist abolished these effects. A(1) receptor activation inhibits AC activity and cAMP generation. The effect of A(1) receptor activation was mimicked by a PKA antagonist, but not by modulators of exchange proteins activated by cAMP, demonstrating that modulation of nerve-mediated ATP release is via PKA. Adenosine had no effect on ACh release or the higher frequency component of nerve-mediated contractions. Differential regulation of neurotransmitter release is possible at the detrusor nerve-muscle junction, as demonstrated by A(1) receptor activation, and downstream inhibition of AC, cAMP generation and PKA. The ability to specifically attenuate ATP release offers a potential to target purinergic motor pathways enhanced in overactive bladder pathologies.",2022,,,,10.1152/ajpregu.00166.2022,#3800,Chakrabarty 2022,adenosine
1116,36283825.0,Differential diagnosis of back pain.,Vnitr Lek,"Back pain (BP) is among the most common reasons for seeking medical attention worldwide. The nature of BP depends on the causative stimulus and its anatomical location. Clinically, BP is manifested by pain, muscle tension, and stiffness. The development of BP is a very complex, multifactorial process in which not only somatic stimuli (anatomical structures), but also psychosocial effects are involved. Using a variety of criteria, BP can be divided into specific where the cause of pain is known, nonspecific wherein the cause remains unclear, or according to its duration (i.e., acute, subacute, and chronic back pain). Simple low back pain must be distinguished from inflammatory BP. Inflammatory BP is one of the symptoms of spondyloarthritides. It is typically a resting pain of insidious onset, peaking at night or in the morning associated with morning stiffness, improved with exercise, and responding to non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs. A red-flag system was developed for the early identification of at-risk patients with a potentially severe disease presenting with BP. Early diagnosis and identification of the cause of complaints often requires multidisciplinary cooperation. The treatment involves pharmacological agents (analgesic and muscle relaxation therapies) and nonpharmacological approaches (rehabilitation, surgical intervention, etc.).",2022,68,5,332-341,10.36290/vnl.2022.068,#3801,CiferskÃ¡ 2022,axial spondylarthritis
1117,21683231.0,Pitfalls and challenges of cloaca repair: how to reduce the need for reoperations.,J Pediatr Surg,"PURPOSE: Cloacal malformations represent the most complex of genitourinary/anorectal anomalies. We have encountered a unique group of complications in referred patients after failed attempted repairs elsewhere and chose to review this experience with the hope of identifying pitfalls to avoid during the primary repair. METHODS: In our series of 509 cloacas, 95 were repaired elsewhere but required reoperation. These cases were reviewed for specific indications for reoperation and methods used for reoperative repair. Key findings at reoperation to explain the complication(s) were specifically sought. RESULTS: Indications for reoperation included the following: persistent urogenital sinus (46), rectal stricture or acquired atresia (45), acquired vaginal atresia or stricture (45), mislocated rectum (36), urethrovaginal fistula (16), rectal prolapse (12), urethral atresia or stricture (7), and rectovaginal fistula (5). Most patients had more than one indication. In cases of persistent urogenital sinus, the surgeons were unaware of the presence of a cloaca, referring instead to the malformation as a ""rectovaginal fistula."" From our reading of the operative reports of the original operations, we ascertain that rectal stricture, atresia, or fistula that occurred was most likely related to tension or ischemia. Prolapse was associated with poor pelvic musculature. The average length of the common channel of those patients with vaginal and urethral problems was 4.1 cm. CONCLUSION: We have observed key complications requiring reoperation in a large series of cloacal malformations that are potentially avoidable. A persistent urogenital sinus can be avoided by properly diagnosing a cloaca and repairing the entire malformation and not just the rectum during the initial repair. Vaginal and urethral complications occurred mainly in patients with a common channel longer than 3 cm. Repair of cloacas with common channels longer than 3 cm requires familiarity with a complex decision-making process, and atresias, strictures, and fistulae can be avoided with adequate mobilization of structures and preservation of blood supply. Rectal prolapse occurrence relates to the quality of the perineal muscles. Reoperations can restore the anatomy, but the functional results are not as good as those achieved after primary repair.",2011,46,6,1250-5,10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2011.03.064,#3802,Levitt 2011,

METHODS: The effect of loperamide on intestinal transit was investigated in mice. Ileum strips were isolated from 12-wk-old male BALB/c mice for identification of isometric tension. The ileum strips were precontracted with 1 μmol/L acetylcholine (ACh). Then, decrease in muscle tone (relaxation) was characterized after cumulative administration of 0.1-10 μmol/L loperamide into the organ bath, for a concentration-dependent study. Specific blockers or antagonists were used for pretreatment to compare the changes in loperamide-induced relaxation. RESULTS: In addition to the delay in intestinal transit, loperamide produced a marked relaxation in isolated ileum precontracted with ACh, in a dose-dependent manner. This relaxation was abolished by cyprodime, a selective opioid μ-receptor antagonist, but not modified by naloxonazine at a dose sufficient to block opioid μ-1 receptors. Also, treatment with opioid μ-1 receptor agonist failed to modify the muscle tone. Moreover, the relaxation by loperamide was attenuated by glibenclamide at a dose sufficient to block ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels, and by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, but was enhanced by an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). CONCLUSION: Loperamide induces intestinal relaxation by activation of opioid μ-2 receptors via the cAMP-PKA pathway to open K(ATP) channels, relates to OIC.",2012,18,12,1391-6,10.3748/wjg.v18.i12.1391,#3803,Chen 2012,ATP-sensitive K+ channels

In view of the limited knowledge of fetal GI motility development, and the primary role of the muscarinic system in adult GI motility, we examined the development of GI muscarinic receptor subtypes associated with ileal motility. STUDY DESIGN: Ovine term fetal, newborn, and pregnant adult ileal longitudinal muscle contractile responses to muscarinic agonists (bethanechol) and muscarinic nonspecific (atropine) and subtype specific-antagonists (M1-M4) were examined in organ baths. Immunohistochemical analysis of ileal muscle muscarinic receptor subtypes was correlated with contractile responses. RESULTS: Bethanechol induced a concentration-dependent ileal contraction at all 3 age groups. Adult ileal maximal tension was 2-fold higher than that of the fetus and newborn, while 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) was similar at all ages. Atropine (10(-6)mol/L) inhibited contractility in fetal (67%+/-7%), newborn (82%+/-5%), and adult (97%+/-2%) in an age-dependent manner. The M3 antagonist exhibited robust inhibition at all age groups while the M2 antagonist demonstrated enhanced inhibition in the fetus. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated coexpression of subtype receptors in fetal, newborn, and adult ileal smooth muscle with increasing expression with advancing age. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a specific developmental pattern of muscarinic receptor subtype expression. Knowledge and/or alterations of GI motility regulation may aid in the treatment of the preterm fetus or newborn.",2003,189,4,953-7,10.1067/s0002-9378(03)00816-0,#3804,Oyachi 2003,
1120,26896946.0,The Role of Acupuncture in Pain Management.,Curr Pain Headache Rep,"Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese practice of medicine that has gained popularity in Western culture and around the world. It involves the insertion of thin needles into the skin to stimulate nerves, muscles, and connective tissues throughout the body with the goal of alleviating pain, tension, and stress. More broadly, acupuncture is actually a family of different procedures. Conceptually, it is believed to stimulate the body's meridians, or energy-carrying channels, in an attempt to correct imbalances and to restore health. These benefits are thought to be derived from the proximity of acupoints with nerves through intracellular calcium ions. This lesson outlines a brief history of acupuncture and how it may be used to treat various types of physical and emotional pain and specific conditions, including overactive bladder and psoriasis. Acupuncture has been demonstrated to enhance endogenous opiates, such as dynorphin, endorphin, encephalin, and release corticosteroids, relieving pain and enhancing the healing process. There are associated risks; however, serious side effects are rare.

The aim of this study was to identify subgroups of patients with tension type headache (TTH) with different levels of sensitization, clinical pain features, and psychological outcomes. METHODS: A total of 197 individuals with TTH participated. Headache intensity, frequency, and duration and medication intake were collected with a 4-weeks diary. Pressure pain thresholds were assessed bilaterally over the temporalis muscle, C5-C6 joint, second metacarpal and tibialis anterior muscle to determine widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale assessed anxiety and depression. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory evaluated the state and trait levels of anxiety. The Headache Disability Inventory evaluated the burden of headache. Health-related quality of life was determined with the SF-36 questionnaire. Groups were considered as positive (three or more criteria) or negative (less than three criteria) on a clinical prediction rule: headache duration <8.5 h/day; headache frequency <5.5 days/week; bodily pain <47 and vitality <47.5. RESULTS: The ANCOVA revealed that subjects in group 1 (positive rule, n = 89) exhibited longer headache history, shorter headache duration, lower headache frequency, higher widespread pressure hyperalgesia, higher anxiety trait levels, and lower quality of life (all, P < 0.01) than those subjects within group 2 (negative rule, n = 108). Differences were similar between men and women. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a subgroup of patients with TTH with higher sensitization, higher chronicity of headaches and worse quality of life but lower frequency and duration of headache episodes.

Clinical experience demonstrates the time to and length of peak benefit of the TVFI is variable. Previous studies collected data 4 weeks or more after TVFI. The aim of this study was to compare subjectively successful and unsuccessful TVFI patient groups. It is hypothesized that patients with subjectively reported success will also have significant improvements in Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), phase closure percentage, and aerodynamic measures 2 weeks after trial augmentation. METHODS/DESIGN: Subjects with glottic insufficiency were included in this retrospective review if they underwent office-based, per-oral vocal fold injection augmentation specifically for trial purposes. Patients were divided into ""successful"" and ""unsuccessful"" groups based on their subjective experience during the 2-week post-TVFI period. VHI-10, subjective report, phase closure evaluation using frame-by-frame analysis, and aerodynamic data were collected pre- and 2 weeks post-TVFI. RESULTS: Of the subjects, 15 of 23 (65%) reported a successful subjective improvement of their symptom, whereas 8 (35%) were unsuccessful (only partial improvement or no improvement). The number of subjects with an improvement in VHI-10 by 5 or more points was not significantly different between groups. The number of subjects that demonstrated complete, long phase closure was significantly higher in the successful group (P = 0.021).

The results showed that the time to peak tension (TPT) and half relaxation time (1/2 RT) of the maximal twitch were 110 +/- 11 ms and 82 +/- 11 ms respectively, and the peak rates of rise of contraction (delta P50, delta P200) and relaxation (delta PR50, delta PR200) at 50 and 200 Hz were 0.36 +/- 0.07, 0.48 +/- 0.08 and 1.27 +/- 0.33, 1.25 +/- 0.27% Po ms-1 respectively. The decline in force during a fatigue test was significantly (P less than 0.02) associated with the decrease in maximal relaxation rate (r = 0.79). The TPT was significantly (P less than 0.05) and inversely related to delta P50 and delta P200. The mean angle specific torque-velocity relationship for the 11 subjects was adequately described by the empirical exponential equation of the form: V = 16.5 (e-P/30.8-e-84.3/30.8) where V = velocity (rads s-1) and P = torque (Nm). The only significant association found between the isometric and isokinetic properties of the muscle was between delta PR200 and the torque expressed at a given velocity of 4 rads s-1.

1128,24306100.0,Gastric sensitivity and reflexes: basic mechanisms underlying clinical problems.,J Gastroenterol,"Both reflex and sensory mechanisms control the function of the stomach, and disturbances in these mechanisms may explain the pathophysiology of disorders of gastric function. The objective of this report is to perform a literature-based critical analysis of new, relevant or conflicting information on gastric sensitivity and reflexes, with particular emphasis on the comprehensive integration of basic and clinical research data. The stomach exerts both phasic and tonic muscular (contractile and relaxatory) activity. Gastric tone determines the capacity of the stomach and mediates both gastric accommodation to a meal as well as gastric emptying, by partial relaxation or progressive recontraction, respectively. Perception and reflex afferent pathways from the stomach are activated independently by specific stimuli, suggesting that the terminal nerve endings operate as specialized receptors. Particularly, perception appears to be related to stimulation of tension receptors, while the existence of volume receptors in the stomach is uncertain. Reliable techniques have been developed to measure gastric perception and reflexes both in experimental and clinical conditions, and have facilitated the identification of abnormal responses in patients with gastric disorders. Gastroparesis is characterised by impaired gastric tone and contractility, whereas patients with functional dyspepsia have impaired accommodation, associated with antral distention and increased gastric sensitivity. An integrated view of fragmented knowledge allows the design of pathophysiological models in an attempt to explain disorders of gastric function, and may facilitate the development of mechanistically orientated treatments.",2014,49,2,206-18,10.1007/s00535-013-0917-8,#3813,Azpiroz 2014,
1129,35985479.0,Neuropilin 2 Is a Novel Regulator of Distal Colon Contractility.,Am J Pathol,"Appropriate coordination of smooth muscle contraction and relaxation is essential for normal colonic motility. The impact of perturbed motility ranges from moderate, in conditions such as colitis, to potentially fatal in the case of pseudo-obstruction. The mechanisms underlying aberrant motility and the extent to which they can be targeted pharmacologically are incompletely understood. This study identified colonic smooth muscle as a major site of expression of neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) in mice and humans. Mice with inducible smooth muscle-specific knockout of Nrp2 had an increase in evoked contraction of colonic rings in response to carbachol at 1 and 4 weeks following initiation of deletion. KCl-induced contractions were also increased at 4 weeks. Colonic motility was similarly enhanced, as evidenced by faster bead expulsion in Nrp2-deleted mice versus Nrp2-intact controls. In length-tension analysis of the distal colon, passive tension was similar in Nrp2-deficient and Nrp2-intact mice, but at low strains, active stiffness was greater in Nrp2-deficient animals. Consistent with the findings in conditional Nrp2 mice, Nrp2-null mice showed increased contractility in response to carbachol and KCl. Evaluation of selected proteins implicated in smooth muscle contraction revealed no significant differences in the level of α-smooth muscle actin, myosin light chain, calponin, or RhoA. Together, these findings identify Nrp2 as a novel regulator of colonic contractility that may be targetable in conditions characterized by dysmotility.",2022,,,,10.1016/j.ajpath.2022.07.013,#3814,Lambrinos 2022,

1131,17518751.0,Oxygen tension directs chondrogenic differentiation of myelo-monocytic progenitors during endochondral bone formation.,Tissue Eng,"Synthesis of bone requires both essential progenitors to form the various structures and the correct microenvironment for their differentiation. To identify these factors, we have used a system that exploits bone morphogenetic protein's ability to induce endochondral bone formation rapidly. One of the earliest events observed was the influx and proliferation of fibroblastic cells that express both vascular smooth muscle cell markers, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and the monocytic marker CD68. The expression of these factors was lost by days 4 to 5, coincident with the up-regulation of Sox9 and the appearance of chondrocytes. Studies with a cyclization recombination (Cre)/lox system, in which a myeloid-specific promoter driving Cre recombinase can irreversibly unblock expression of beta-galactosidase only in cells of myeloid origin, showed specific activity in the newly formed chondrocytes. These results suggest that early chondrocyte progenitors are of myeloid origin. Simultaneous with this recruitment, we determined that a numbers of these cells were in a hypoxic state, indicative of a low-oxygen environment. The cells in the hypoxic regions were undergoing chondrogenesis, whereas cells in adjacent normoxic regions appeared to be assembling into new vessels, suggesting that the oxygen microenvironment is critical for establishment of the cartilage.",2007,13,8,2011-9,10.1089/ten.2006.0063,#3816,Shafer 2007,

Primary attention was paid to the effects of wind and stringed instruments. The aim of the article was the presentation of research and opinions about this problem in the last 25 years. It is reported that long-term and repetitive playing of musical instruments, particularly stringed (violin and viola) and wind instruments can cause dysfunctions of the stomatognathic system. The impact of wind instruments was assessed in terms of the type of mouthpiece. We studied the possibility of repositioning the front teeth and reducing the width of the upper dental arch and overbite. There were also reports on the use of a specific instrument to improve the child's occlusion. Studies have also been performed on the usefulness of relaxation plates in order to improve, and even prevent, dysfunction caused by the constant stress on the same parts of the stomatognathic system. The experiments were mainly based on interviews, dental cast analyses and cephalometric analyses. Additional methods were dynamometer tests and muscle tension palpation.",2014,23,1,143-6,10.17219/acem/37038,#3817,GÅowacka 2014,

Psychotherapy is associated with measurable changes in central and peripheral neurophysiology. These markers could be harnessed to aid informed, personalized recommendations for specific psychosocial treatments, to guide a course of treatment, and to predict treatment outcomes, in lieu of relying on costly, trial-and-error approaches. Psychotherapy and empathy research also demonstrate that the patient-doctor relationship has important neurophysiological correlates that can be salient to treatment outcomes, as illustrated in a case example. These correlates include autonomic nervous system arousal manifested by heart rate, respiration rate, muscle tension, and galvanic skin resistance; electroencephalography; and brain-imaging markers. While additional biomarker research is unfolding, there are specific neurobiologically based clinical and subclinical observations, organized by using the E.M.P.A.T.H.Y. mnemonic, that may guide and enhance psychotherapy.

1134,2425960.0,Calcium channel antagonists and the treatment of migraine.,Clin Neuropharmacol,"Despite ongoing dispute over the pathophysiologic basis of migraine, the vasospastic theory of pathogenesis has brought to the forefront a promising class of new antimigraine agents, the Ca2+ channel antagonists. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, integral membrane proteins that permit extracellular Ca2+ to enter cells down their electrical and concentration gradients, have a universal role in stimulus-response coupling in excitable cells. Thus, they participate in translating electrical excitation into secretory and contractile events. Ca2+ channel antagonists, a structurally diverse group of organic compounds, inhibit ion flux through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels by binding to specific, channel-associated drug receptor sites and thereby reduce the frequency of channel opening in response to membrane depolarization. Ca2+ channels in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and neurons all exhibit high affinity for Ca2+ channel antagonists, although neurons also contain a population of drug-resistant channels. Extensive clinical experience in the use of Ca2+ channel antagonists has accumulated from their application to nonneurologic, especially cardiovascular, disorders. Three such drugs, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, are currently available in the United States, although none are specifically approved for use in migraine. Other agents, such as nimodipine, are likely to be released in the near future. A large number of clinical studies have now addressed the efficacy of Ca2+ channel antagonists in the prophylaxis of migraine headache. Dihydropyridines (nifedipine and nimodipine), phenylalkylamines (verapamil), diphenylalkylamines (flunarizine), and benzothiazepines (diltiazem) have all been examined, and a beneficial effect has been noted in each case. The limited directly comparative data currently available and the difficulties involved in comparing the results of different studies do not presently support claims of superiority for any single agent. This is an issue that will require attention as these drugs achieve more widespread use in migraine. Existing evidence suggests that flunarizine, verapamil, nifedipine, and nimodipine are effective prophylactic agents in both common and classic migraine. Nifedipine and nimodipine also appear to be valuable for the treatment of cluster headache. Two case reports describing favorable responses to flunarizine in childhood hemiplegic migraine are the only available data concerning the utility of these drugs in ""complicated"" migraine syndromes. The role of Ca2+ channel antagonists in treating ""muscle contraction"" or ""tension"" headache has not been addressed in any detail.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1986,9,4,311-28,10.1097/00002826-198608000-00001,#3819,Greenberg 1986,
1135,19768545.0,Surgical and morphological factors that affect internal mechanical loads in soft tissues of the transtibial residuum.,Ann Biomed Eng,"The residual limb of transtibial amputation (TTA) prosthetic users is threatened daily by pressure ulcers (PU) and deep tissue injury (DTI) caused mainly by sustained mechanical strains and stresses. Several risk factors dominate the extent of internal tissue loads in the residuum. In this study, we developed a set of three-dimensional finite element (FE) models that were variants of a patient-specific FE model, built from magnetic resonance imaging scans. The set of FE modes was utilized to assess the impact of the following risk factors on the strain/stress distribution in the muscle flap: (i) the tibial length, (ii) the tibial bevelment, (iii) a fibular osteophyte, (iv) the mechanical properties of the muscle, and (v) scarring in different locations and depths. A total of 12 nonlinear FE model configurations, representing variations in these factors, were built and solved. We present herein calculations of compression, tension and shear strains and stresses, von Mises stresses, and strain energy density averaged in critical locations in the muscle flap as well as volumes of concentration of elevated stresses in these areas. Our results overall show higher stresses accumulating in the bone proximity rather than in outlying soft tissues. The longer bone configurations spread the loads toward the external surfaces of the muscle flap. When shortening the truncated bones from 11.2 to 9.2 cm, the von Mises stresses at the distal edges of the bones were relieved considerably (by up to 80%), which indicates a predicted decreased risk for DTI. Decreasing the tibial bevelment mildly, from 52.3 degrees to 37.7 degrees caused propagation of internal stresses from the bone proximity toward the more superficial soft tissues of the residuum, thereby also theoretically reducing the risk for DTI. An osteophyte at the distal fibular end increased the strain and stress distributions directly under the fibula but had little effect (<1%) on stresses at other sites, e.g., under the tibia. Elevation of muscle stiffness (instantaneous shear modulus increase from 8.5 to 16.2 kPa), simulating variation between patients, and muscle flap contraction or spasm, showed the most substantial effect by an acute rise of the von Mises stresses at the bone proximity. The mean von Mises stresses at the bone proximity were approximately twofold higher in the contracted/spastic muscle when compared to the flaccid muscle. Locating a surgical scar in different sites and depths of the residuum had the least influence on the overall loading of the muscle flap (where stresses changed by <7%). Pending further validation by epidemiological PU and DTI risk factor studies, the conclusions of this study can be incorporated as guidelines for TTA surgeons, physical therapists, prosthetists, and the TTA patients themselves to minimize the onset of PU and DTI in this population. Additionally, the present analyses can be used to guide or focus epidemiological research of PU and DTI risk factors in the TTA population.",2009,37,12,2583-605,10.1007/s10439-009-9801-3,#3820,Portnoy 2009,
1136,17056714.0,A common mechanism underlies stretch activation and receptor activation of TRPC6 channels.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"The TRP family of ion channels transduce an extensive range of chemical and physical signals. TRPC6 is a receptor-activated nonselective cation channel expressed widely in vascular smooth muscle and other cell types. We report here that TRPC6 is also a sensor of mechanically and osmotically induced membrane stretch. Pressure-induced activation of TRPC6 was independent of phospholipase C. The stretch responses were blocked by the tarantula peptide, GsMTx-4, known to specifically inhibit mechanosensitive channels by modifying the external lipid-channel boundary. The GsMTx-4 peptide also blocked the activation of TRPC6 channels by either receptor-induced PLC activation or by direct application of diacylglycerol. The effects of the peptide on both stretch- and diacylglycerol-mediated TRPC6 activation indicate that the mechanical and chemical lipid sensing by the channel has a common molecular mechanism that may involve lateral-lipid tension. The mechanosensing properties of TRPC6 channels highly expressed in smooth muscle cells are likely to play a key role in regulating myogenic tone in vascular tissue.",2006,103,44,16586-91,10.1073/pnas.0606894103,#3821,Spassova 2006,
1137,24398607.0,Microcirculation in hypertensive patients.,Biorheology,"Regardless of the mechanisms that initiate the increase in blood pressure, functional and structural changes in the systemic vasculature are the final result of long-standing hypertension. These changes can occur in the macro- but also in the microvasculature. The supply of the tissues with oxygen, nutrients, and metabolites occurs almost exclusively in the microcirculation (which comprises resistance arterioles, capillaries and venules), and an adequate perfusion via the microcirculatory network is essential for the integrity of tissue and organ function. This review focuses on results from clinical studies in hypertensive patients, which have been performed in close cooperation with different clinical groups over the last three decades. Intravital microscopy was used to study skin microcirculation, microcatheters for the analysis of skeletal muscle microcirculation, the slit lamp for conjunctival microcirculation and the laser scanning ophthalmoscope for the measurement of the retinal capillary network. The first changes of the normal microcirculation can be found in about 93% of patients with essential hypertension, long before organ dysfunctions become clinically manifest. The earliest disorders were found in skin capillaries and thereafter in the retina and the skeletal muscle. In general, the disorders in the different areas were clearly correlated. While capillary rarefaction occurred mainly in the retina and the conjunctiva bulbi, in skin capillaries morphological changes were rare. A significant decrease of capillary erythrocyte velocities under resting conditions together with a marked damping of the postischemic hyperemia was found, both correlating with the duration of hypertension or WHO stage or the fundus hypertonicus stage. Also the mean oxygen tension in the skeletal muscle was correlated with the state of the disease. These data show that the microcirculatory disorders in hypertension are systemic and are hallmarks of the long-term complications of hypertension. There is now a large body of evidence that microvascular changes occur very early and may be important in their pathogenesis and progression.",2013,50,6-May,241-55,10.3233/BIR-130645,#3822,Jung 2013,Hypertension
1138,23111099.0,The effectiveness of acupuncture in treating chronic non-specific low back pain: a systematic review of the literature.,J Orthop Surg Res,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal disorder defined as pain and soreness, muscle tension, or stiffness in the lumbosacral area of the spine which does not have a specific cause. Low back pain results in high health costs and incapacity to work causing an economic burden to society. The optimal management of non-specific low back pain appears to be undecided. Recently published guidelines support the use of acupuncture for treating non-specific low back pain and it has become a popular alternative treatment modality for patients with low back pain. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted through Medline using Ovid and Medical Subject Headings for randomized controlled trials published in the last 10 years. The outcomes scored were subjective pain scores and functional outcome scores. RESULTS: Eighty two randomized studies were identified, of which 7 met our inclusion criteria. Three studies found a significant difference in pain scores when comparing acupuncture, or sham acupuncture, with conventional therapy or no care. Two studies demonstrated a significant difference between acupuncture treatment and no treatment or routine care at 8 weeks and 3 months. Three studies demonstrated no significant difference between acupuncture and minimal/sham acupuncture with no difference in pain relief or function over 6 to 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides some evidence to support acupuncture as more effective than no treatment, but no conclusions can be drawn about its effectiveness over other treatment modalities as the evidence is conflicting.",2012,7,,36,10.1186/1749-799X-7-36,#3823,Hutchinson 2012,

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective and single-blinded. METHODS: In this study, 40 patients with a single voice disorder diagnosis of either benign vocal fold lesions (lesions), primary muscle tension dysphonia (MTD-1), vocal fold atrophy (atrophy) or unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) underwent baseline testing, a single intervention-type (phonosurgery/voice therapy), and follow-up testing at uniform time points. Ten patients per diagnosis group were analyzed before and after treatment. Time- and frequency-based acoustic measures taken from vowels and sentences as well as patient-perceptual analysis (Voice Handicap Index-10) were reviewed. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were observed for three of four groups. Patients with muscle tension dysphonia displayed an improvement in Cepstral Spectral Index of Dysphonia speech (CSID) (P < 0.05). Patients with lesions had improved Voice Handicap Index-10 (P < 0.05), cepstral peak prominence (CPP) vowel standard deviation (P < 0.05), and CPP speech (P < 0.05). Patients with atrophy did not demonstrate significant improvement in any measure. Patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis showed an improvement in CSID speech (P < 0.05) and CPP speech (P < 0.05). In addition, strong effect sizes were observed for many of the acoustic parameters studied. CONCLUSIONS: For all groups except atrophy, treatment was successful in improving patient perception of voice handicap and/or some acoustic voice parameters.

1140,26847712.0,Load-dependent modulation of non-muscle myosin-2A function by tropomyosin 4.2.,Sci Rep,"Tropomyosin isoforms play an important role in the organisation of cytoplasmic actomyosin complexes in regard to function and cellular localisation. In particular, Tpm4.2 is upregulated in rapidly migrating cells and responsible for the specific recruitment of the cytoplasmic class-2 myosin NM-2A to actin filaments during the formation of stress fibres. Here, we investigate how the decoration of F-actin with Tpm4.2 affects the motor properties of NM-2A under conditions of low and high load. In the absence of external forces, decoration of actin filaments with Tpm4.2 does not affect the gated release of ADP from NM-2A and the transition from strong to weak actin-binding states. In the presence of resisting loads, our results reveal a marked increase in the mechanosensitive gating between the leading and trailing myosin head. Thereby, the processive behaviour of NM-2A is enhanced in the presence of resisting loads. The load- and Tpm4.2-induced changes in the functional behaviour of NM-2A are in good agreement with the role of this myosin in the context of stress fibres and the maintenance of cellular tension.",2016,6,,20554,10.1038/srep20554,#3825,Hundt 2016,
1141,24665025.0,[Salvage laparoscopic pyeloplasty in the worst case scenario: after failed open repair and endoscopic salvage].,Urologia,"OBJECTIVES: We present the video of a laparoscopic correction of a left ureteropelvic junction obstruction in a patient who has already undergone previous surgical open pyeloplasty and subsequent acucise for failure of the first surgery. At 8 years after the second surgery, the patient showed a recurrence of the obstruction of the left ureteropelvic junction.
 It was decided to perform the retroperitoneal laparoscopic correction of the obstruction.
 MATERIALS AND METHODS: With the patient placed in a 90° flank position, 4 trocars are placed in the retroperitoneum space by the Hasson tecnique.
 After the creation of the retroperitoneum space, the Gerota's fascia is opened. The posterior layer of the Gerota's fascia appears very thickened at the level of the lower pole of the kidney and is very adherent with the surrounding structures, in particular the psoas muscle.
 Gerota's fascia is incised and removed from the previous surgery and the psoas muscle is identified. The distal lumbar ureter is tenaciously anchored to the psoas muscle. The lower pole of the kidney is freed from the adhesions of the previous surgery. The proximal ureter is hardly isolable for the presence of fibrosis. The renal pelvis is fixed to the psoas due to fibrotic tissue that is cut with scissors. Once the pelvis and the ureter are separated from the psoas, the surgery proceeds with the liberation of the pelvis from the adipose tissue and fibrosis that surround it. The pieloureteral obstruction is not easily identifiable. The renal pelvis is opened at the level of the ureteral junction, the ureter is spatulated on its medial side. The scar tissue is removed until well vascularized tissue is seen. The anastomosis between the ureter and pelvis is performed with 2 semicontinuous running sutures. Once the anterior plate of the anastomosis is completed a cystoscopic retrograde DJ ureteral stent insertion is performed. The procedure ends with the packaging of the posterior plate of the anastomosis with the second running suture.
 RESULTS: The operation lasted 180 minutes. The postoperative course was uneventful, the drain was removed on the second day and the bladder catheter on the 4th. The patient was discharged on the 5th day and the DJ ureteral stent was removed on the 21st post-operative day. 
 DISCUSSION: The laparoscopic reoperation in patients with previous open surgery interventions is definitely difficult. This kind of surgery has to be carried out after having gained considerable laparoscopy experience. Specifically, the reoperation of laparoscopic pyeloplasty after 2 previous intervention poses the following difficulties: the creation of appropriate space, dissection of the ureter and pelvis from the psoas muscle, appropriate mobilization of the lower pole of the kidney to get a ""tension free"" anastomosis, liberation of the pelvis and ureter from the tenaciously adherent fibrotic tissue, identification of the stenotic ureteropelvic junction.
 CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic pyeloplasty after failure of past interventions remains a difficult procedure that should only be performed after major laparoscopic experience. In experienced hands, redo laparoscopic pyeloplasty provides high success rates.",2014,81 Suppl 23,,S9-14,10.5301/RU.2014.11979,#3826,Parma 2014,

However, few studies investigate the changes in physiological and mental profiles during varied sport periodization among this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the changes in sports performance and stress-related biomarkers between the competitive season (CS) and off-season (OS) in elite adolescent basketball players. METHOD: Nine elite Division I male basketball players (age: 15-18 years. old) participated in this study. Basketball-specific performance, salivary dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)/cortisol levels, mood state, and sleep quality were all accessed during the CS and OS periods. RESULTS: The training load during OS was 26.0% lower than CS (p = 0.001). Muscle mass, aerobic capacity, 10 m sprint, and Abalakov jump (AJ) power during OS were greater than that during CS (+2.2-9.8%, p < 0.05), but planned agility was greater during CS (p = 0.003). The salivary DHEA-S/cortisol was greater during CS than during OS (p = 0.039). The overall mood state and sleep quality did not differ between periods, but the POMS-tension was higher during CS (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that muscle mass, aerobic capacity, peak AJ power, and 10 m sprint performance, but not planned agility, were greater during OS compared to CS among elite adolescent basketball players. Furthermore, the stress-related responses reflected by the D/C ratio and mood tension were relatively lower during the OS in these athletes. Thus, this study suggests that coaches and sport science professionals should closely monitor athletes' training states across varied training/competition periods to better react to modifying training or recovery plans.",2021,18,24,,10.3390/ijerph182413259,#3828,Chou 2021,change of direction

The etiology and pathophysiology of pain syndromes are studied from the point of view of each individual medical specialty, but do not consider the relationship and interaction of pathogenetic factors. In many areas, clinical guidelines for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain have been developed, but without taking into account the multidisciplinary approach to this polyetiological disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of tolperisone (calmirex) in patients with chronic nonspecific pelvic pain receiving standard therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the course of clinical work, 61 patients with chronic nonspecific pelvic pain were observed. To identify the dynamics of the study, all patients were assessed for the severity of pain using a visually analogue scale (VAS), the area of pain, muscle-tonic reactions estimated by the index of muscle tension according to Khabirov. Deviations of the biomechanical parameters of the pelvic region and restoration of the musculoskeletal system statics were evaluated. According to the study protocol, the efficacy of tolperisone (calmirex) was studied in patients receiving standard therapy. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Myofascial and muscle-tonic reactions play a significant role in the development and maintenance of chronic nonspecific pelvic pain. At the same time, tolperisone (calmirex) together with standard therapy of chronic nonspecific pelvic pain contributes to an effective regression of pain of myofascial and muscular-tonic origin, and creates a favorable restorative background for non-drug treatment.",2020,120,6,45-50,10.17116/jnevro202012006145,#3829,Barulin 2020,biomechanics of the spine

Introducing the Voice Disability Coping Questionnaire.,J Voice,"Coping is a key concept in psychological medicine, which refers to the way in which people deal with the stress of illness. Voice disorders may have pervasive effects upon the individual's life beyond the vocal impairment yet, there is little reference in current literature as to how people cope with voice problems. This study explored and validated the Voice Disability Coping Questionnaire (VDCQ), a newly developed disease-specific coping measure, which elicits how patients cope with voice problems. Eighty subjects presenting with muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) and adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ASD) completed a 28-item VDCQ as part of an initial assessment protocol before intervention, within a longitudinal study. Principal component analyses were used to investigate the underlying structure of this questionnaire; analyses of variance were used to determine group differences in coping strategies. The principal component analyses generated four coping subscales: ""social support,"" ""passive coping,"" ""avoidance,"" and ""information seeking"" measured over 15 items. The subscales revealed logical correlations between them. Avoidance and passive coping were found to be used by the ASD group significantly more than the MTD group. This study provided initial evidence for the validity and reliability of the VDCQ; it differentiated between clinical groups and may facilitate a patient-centered approach, which enhances the understanding of voice disorders.",2009,23,2,209-17,10.1016/j.jvoice.2007.09.001,#3830,Epstein 2009,

In this report we briefly review the effects of several inflammatory mediators, including eicosanoids, platelet-activating factor, and histamine, as well as the effects of plasma proteins and tachykinins that may be secondarily released because of the presence of inflammatory mediators on endothelial and epithelial permeability. We then consider physical mechanisms whereby the resulting airway luminal liquid could amplify the response of an airway previously constricted because of smooth muscle contraction. Specifically, liquid in the interstices between epithelial projections that are formed during muscular contraction could amplify the degree of luminal compromise by (1) further decreasing luminal cross-sectional area by occupying space, and (2) providing an additional source of inward recoil because of the surface tension of the air-liquid interface.",1991,143,3 Pt 2,S52-4,10.1164/ajrccm/143.3_Pt_2.S52,#3831,Yager 1991,

This article reviews the most common injuries described in the literature, including musculoskeletal problems in the lower back, ribs, shoulder, wrist and knee. A review of basic rowing physiology and equipment is included, along with a description of the mechanics of the rowing stroke. This information is necessary in order to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment protocol for these injuries, which are mainly chronic in nature. The most frequently injured region is the low back, mainly due to excessive hyperflexion and twisting, and can include specific injuries such as spondylolysis, sacroiliac joint dysfunction and disc herniation. Rib stress fractures account for the most time lost from on-water training and competition. Although theories abound for the mechanism of injury, the exact aetiology of rib stress fractures remains unknown. Other injuries discussed within, which are specific to ribs, include costochondritis, costovertebral joint subluxation and intercostal muscle strains. Shoulder pain is quite common in rowers and can be the result of overuse, poor technique, or tension in the upper body. Injuries concerning the forearm and wrist are also common, and can include exertional compartment syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, deQuervain's and intersection syndrome, and tenosynovitis of the wrist extensors. In the lower body, the major injuries reported include generalised patellofemoral pain due to abnormal patellar tracking, and iliotibial band friction syndrome. Lastly, dermatological issues, such as blisters and abrasions, and miscellaneous issues, such as environmental concerns and the female athlete triad, are also included in this article.Pathophysiology, mechanism of injury, assessment and management strategies are outlined in the text for each injury, with special attention given to ways to correct biomechanical or equipment problems specific to rowing. By gaining an understanding of basic rowing biomechanics and training habits, the physician and/or healthcare provider will be better equipped to treat and prevent injuries in the rowing population.",2005,35,6,537-55,10.2165/00007256-200535060-00005,#3832,Rumball 2005,
1148,1967127.0,Thymopoietin inhibits function and ligand binding to nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"Thymopoietin is a 48 to 49 amino acid polypeptide hormone of the thymus, which regulates immune function. The present experiments show that the polypeptide can cause a complete block of transmission of the phrenic nerve diaphragm junction of the rat in vitro; contractile responses evoked by phrenic nerve stimulation were blocked by concentrations of thymopoietin as low as 10(-8) M. The thymopoietin-induced inhibition of indirectly evoked muscle contractions was dose- and time-dependent, with the polypeptide being only slightly less potent than alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT). Twitch responses to direct electrical stimulation of the muscle were not affected by thymopoietin, indicating that it did not inhibit muscle tension by an action on the muscle contractile mechanism per se. Furthermore, thymopoietin did not alter resting or stimulated release of acetylcholine from the phrenic nerve, suggesting that it did not interact at a presynaptic level. On the other hand, thymopoietin inhibited the binding of [125I]alpha-BGT to the nicotinic receptor of rat hemidiaphragm. In intact muscle tissue, the IC50 value for inhibition of [125I]alpha-BGT binding by thymopoietin was 2.1 x 10(-7) M, a value similar to the concentration of polypeptide required to inhibit phrenic nerve-induced muscle contraction (IC50 value, 0.75-1.6 x 10(-7) M). In a muscle membrane preparation, the potency of thymopoietin to affect [125I]alpha-BGT binding was increased (IC50 value, 0.35 nM); thus thymopoietin has the potential to interact at the nicotinic receptor in the nM range. To conclude, the present results show that thymopoietin inhibits neuromuscular activity by an effect that appears to be a specific interaction at the nicotinic receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1990,254,3,1113-9,,#3833,Quik 1990,
1149,8124441.0,The application of force to the healing tendon.,J Hand Ther,"This paper redefines the term ""active motion"" in postoperative tendon management programs as ""minimal active muscle-tendon tension"" (MAMTT), and reports a study of internal forces applied to a repaired tendon with MAMTT, with specific guidelines for joint angle and external load application, that allows a repeatable and reliable technique for the application of active stress to a healing tendon repaired with some currently available popular suture techniques. A comparative analysis of the reported tensile strengths of 28 different repair techniques comparing methods of study with conversion of newtons to grams provides the therapist easy access to a workable equation for force application being less than the tensile strength of any specific repair. The ""active"" hold position or MAMTT for the digital flexor system is calculated mathematically, with drag eliminated, and joint angle position of 45 degrees wrist extension, metacarpophalangeal joint flexion of 83 degrees, proximal interphalangeal joint flexion of 75 degrees, and distal interphalangeal joint flexion of 40 degrees, and an external load applied at the fingertip of 50 grams. In this position, the internal force on the flexor digitorum profundus is 41 grams, and that on the flexor digitorum superficialis is 605 grams. These forces dramatically increase as joint angles become greater, creating forces that exceed the tensile strengths of most repairs. Internal forces along the extensor system are calculated mathematically at approximately 300 grams when the wrist is positioned at 20 degrees of flexion, and the digital joints at a position of 0 degrees of extension in an active hold position. Postoperative management of the repaired flexor or extensor tendon with immediate active motion described as MAMTT is supported by a clinical review of 165 tendons treated with this technique.",1993,6,4,266-84,10.1016/s0894-1130(12)80328-0,#3834,Evans 1993,

NO, produced in the endothelial cell, causes vasodilation by relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle cell. Inhalation of NO plays a role in the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, a syndrome with considerable morbidity and mortality. NO inhalation specifically leads to pulmonary vasodilation without systemic hypotension, since NO binds avidly to haemoglobin. Neonates with pulmonary hypertension associated with lung hypoplasia, meconium aspiration syndrome, infantile inspiratory distress syndrome due to surfactant deficiency, and sepsis have been treated with inhaled NO. Literature data on NO inhalation and experience in our units with NO inhalation show an improvement in arterial oxygen tension and a decreased need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, but no reduction in mortality.

1151,34819116.0,The ACAMTO study-impact of add-on osteopathic treatment on adolescent patients with anorexia nervosa: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,Trials,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) mainly affects women (sex ratio 1/10) and most often starts during adolescence. The prognosis of AN remains poor (10% of deaths and high risk of chronicity). Body dissatisfaction, disturbances in recognition and identification of body sensations are some of the key symptoms of AN. However, there is a contrast between this consensual observation of body image disorders in AN, and the relative deficit of specifically targeted body treatments. Our proposal for a body approach specifically dedicated to AN is based on the understanding that posture, breathing, muscle tension and body perception are closely linked to our psychological and emotional state and are therefore disturbed in patients with AN. The purpose of this monocentric randomized controlled trial is to evaluate if a targeted osteopathic protocol treatment for AN in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) is significantly more effective than TAU alone. METHODS: In total, 72 patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups: one receiving the specific osteopathic treatment targeted for AN in addition to the TAU (group A) and the other one, receiving TAU only (group B). The patients in group A will receive 5 30-min osteopathic treatment sessions. Soft specific palpatory techniques on the diaphragm, digestive system and cervical region will be performed. The TAU is defined by the multidisciplinary approach recommended by the French health high authority. The primary outcome is the evaluation of interoceptive sensibility and secondary outcomes include clinical and psychopathology-related symptoms with assessment of somatic dysfunctions' evolution. A qualitative study will also be carried out, applying the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis method. Patients will be included for a maximum of 14 weeks between the inclusion time and the last evaluation. DISCUSSION: If the results of the study are positive (statistically significant efficacy of this osteopathic treatment protocol), the study will provide arguments in favor of osteopathic sessions as a possible non-invasive additional treatment option in the multidisciplinary care approach for patients with AN.

1152,31261126.0,"Flow-induced, inflammation-mediated arterial wall remodeling in the formation and progression of intracranial aneurysms.",Neurosurg Focus,"OBJECTIVE: Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are relatively common lesions that may cause devastating intracranial hemorrhage, thus producing considerable suffering and anxiety in those affected by the disease or an increased likelihood of developing it. Advances in the knowledge of the pathobiology behind intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation, progression, and rupture have led to preclinical testing of drug therapies that would prevent IA formation or progression. In parallel, novel biologically based diagnostic tools to estimate rupture risk are approaching clinical use. Arterial wall remodeling, triggered by flow and intramural stresses and mediated by inflammation, is relevant to both. METHODS: This review discusses the basis of flow-driven vessel remodeling and translates that knowledge to the observations made on the mechanisms of IA initiation and progression on studies using animal models of induced IA formation, study of human IA tissue samples, and study of patient-derived computational fluid dynamics models. RESULTS: Blood flow conditions leading to high wall shear stress (WSS) activate proinflammatory signaling in endothelial cells that recruits macrophages to the site exposed to high WSS, especially through macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1). This macrophage infiltration leads to protease expression, which disrupts the internal elastic lamina and collagen matrix, leading to focal outward bulging of the wall and IA initiation. For the IA to grow, collagen remodeling and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation are essential, because the fact that collagen does not distend much prevents the passive dilation of a focal weakness to a sizable IA. Chronic macrophage infiltration of the IA wall promotes this SMC-mediated growth and is a potential target for drug therapy. Once the IA wall grows, it is subjected to changes in wall tension and flow conditions as a result of the change in geometry and has to remodel accordingly to avoid rupture. Flow affects this remodeling process. CONCLUSIONS: Flow triggers an inflammatory reaction that predisposes the arterial wall to IA initiation and growth and affects the associated remodeling of the UIA wall. This chronic inflammation is a putative target for drug therapy that would stabilize UIAs or prevent UIA formation. Moreover, once this coupling between IA wall remodeling and flow is understood, data from patient-specific flow models can be gathered as part of the diagnostic workup and utilized to improve risk assessment for UIA initiation, progression, and eventual rupture.",2019,47,1,E21,10.3171/2019.5.FOCUS19234,#3837,FrÃ¶sen 2019,CFD = computational fluid dynamics
1153,36167865.0,Restricting movements of lower face leaves recognition of emotional vocalizations intact but introduces a valence positivity bias.,Sci Rep,"Blocking facial mimicry can disrupt recognition of emotion stimuli. Many previous studies have focused on facial expressions, and it remains unclear whether this generalises to other types of emotional expressions. Furthermore, by emphasizing categorical recognition judgments, previous studies neglected the role of mimicry in other processing stages, including dimensional (valence and arousal) evaluations. In the study presented herein, we addressed both issues by asking participants to listen to brief non-verbal vocalizations of four emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness) and neutral sounds under two conditions. One of the conditions included blocking facial mimicry by creating constant tension on the lower face muscles, in the other condition facial muscles remained relaxed. After each stimulus presentation, participants evaluated sounds' category, valence, and arousal. Although the blocking manipulation did not influence emotion recognition, it led to higher valence ratings in a non-category-specific manner, including neutral sounds. Our findings suggest that somatosensory and motor feedback play a role in the evaluation of affect vocalizations, perhaps introducing a directional bias. This distinction between stimulus recognition, stimulus categorization, and stimulus evaluation is important for understanding what cognitive and emotional processing stages involve somatosensory and motor processes.",2022,12,1,16101,10.1038/s41598-022-18888-0,#3838,WoÅoszyn 2022,
1154,15665854.0,TRPC1 forms the stretch-activated cation channel in vertebrate cells.,Nat Cell Biol,"The mechanosensitive cation channel (MscCa) transduces membrane stretch into cation (Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+)) flux across the cell membrane, and is implicated in cell-volume regulation, cell locomotion, muscle dystrophy and cardiac arrhythmias. However, the membrane protein(s) that form the MscCa in vertebrates remain unknown. Here, we use an identification strategy that is based on detergent solubilization of frog oocyte membrane proteins, followed by liposome reconstitution and evaluation by patch-clamp. The oocyte was chosen because it expresses the prototypical MscCa (>or=10(7)MscCa/oocyte) that is preserved in cytoskeleton-deficient membrane vesicles. We identified a membrane-protein fraction that reconstituted high MscCa activity and showed an abundance of a protein that had a relative molecular mass of 80,000 (M(r) 80K). This protein was identified, by immunological techniques, as the canonical transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1). Heterologous expression of the human TRPC1 resulted in a >1,000% increase in MscCa patch density, whereas injection of a TRPC1-specific antisense RNA abolished endogenous MscCa activity. Transfection of human TRPC1 into CHO-K1 cells also significantly increased MscCa expression. These observations indicate that TRPC1 is a component of the vertebrate MscCa, which is gated by tension developed in the lipid bilayer, as is the case in various prokaryotic mechanosensitive (Ms) channels.",2005,7,2,179-85,10.1038/ncb1218,#3839,Maroto 2005,

He hypothesized that if an individual exhibited (1) marked response stereotypy, and (2) inadequate homeostatic restraints, then (3) exposure to activating situations would result in psychosomatic episodes. The main purpose of the present study was to examine the second component of the Sternbach model, homeostatic inadequacy, as indicated by impaired rate of recovery from stressful stimulation. In addition, the presence of response stereotypy was investigated in this study. Ten subjects from each of 5 diagnostic groups (rheumatoid arthritis, essential hypertension, migraine headache, tension headache, and healthy controls) were observed under conditions of unstructured relaxation, easement (exposure to stimuli intended to enhance relaxation), mild stress, and recovery from stress. Forearm and forehead muscle potential, peripheral temperature, electrodermal response, heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were monitored during these sessions. Although evidence of symptom specific response stereotypy was regularly observed, slowness of recovery did not emerge as a robust phenomenon in the four psychosomatic disorders investigated.

1156,34767251.0,Fast voltage-dependent sodium (Na(V) ) currents are functionally expressed in mouse corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells.,Br J Pharmacol,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) exhibits phasic contractions that are coordinated by ion channels. Mouse models are commonly used to study erectile dysfunction, but there are few published electrophysiological studies of mouse CCSM. We describe the voltage-dependent sodium (Na(V) ) currents in mouse CCSM and investigate their function. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used electrophysiological, pharmacological and immunocytochemical methods to study the Na(V) currents in isolated CCSM cells from C57BL/6 mice. Tension measurements were carried out using crural sections of the corpus cavernosum in whole tissue. KEY RESULTS: Fast, voltage-dependent, sodium currents in mouse CCSM were induced by depolarising steps. Steady-state activation and inactivation curves revealed a window current between -60 and -30 mV. Two populations of Na(V) currents, 'TTX-sensitive' and 'TTX-insensitive', were identified. TTX-sensitive currents showed 48% block with the Na(V) channel subtype-specific blockers ICA-121431 (Na(V) 1.1-1.3), PF-05089771 (Na(V) 1.7) and 4,9-anhydro-TTX (Na(V) 1.6). TTX-insensitive currents were resistant to blockade by A803467, specific for Na(V) 1.8 channels. Immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of Na(V) 1.5 and Na(V) 1.4 in freshly dispersed CCSM cells. Veratridine, a Na(V) channel activator, reduced time-dependent inactivation of Na(V) currents and increased duration of evoked action potentials. Veratridine induced phasic contractions in CCSM strips, reversible with TTX and nifedipine but not KB-R7943. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: There are fast, voltage-dependent, sodium currents in mouse CCSM. Stimulation of these currents increased contractility of CCSM in vitro, suggesting an involvement in detumescence and potentially providing a clinically relevant target in erectile dysfunction.

No response to this dose of naloxone was induced either by incubation in control solution without opiate for 2-24 h or by exposure of the preparation to opiate for 30 min at 37 degrees C.2 When segments were incubated for 24 h, the size of the response to naloxone was directly related both to the normorphine concentration in the incubation fluid (0.01 to 0.1 muM), and to the concentration of naloxone applied (0.03 to 0.1 muM).3 A spontaneous withdrawal contracture was elicited in ilea that had been incubated with normorphine (1.0 muM), when the normorphine-containing bathing fluid was exchanged for one without opiate.4 Normorphine restored to resting level the tension of the withdrawal contracture, whether it had been elicited spontaneously or by naloxone challenge.5 Addition of naloxone (1.0 muM) to normorphine (1.0 muM) in the incubation fluid abolished the withdrawal contracture to subsequent challenge with naloxone.6 Naloxone elicited a contracture from segments incubated for 24 h at 22 degrees C with levorphanol (0.1 muM) but not from those incubated with dextrorphan.7 Application of (+)-naloxone (0.03 muM) to segments previously incubated with normorphine (0.1 muM) did not elicit a contracture.8 The contracture elicited by naloxone in preparations incubated with morphine (10 muM) was associated with a reduction in sensitivity to the acute inhibitory effect of morphine on the electrically-evoked response.9 Addition of hyoscine (0.5 muM) immediately after challenge with naloxone restored the tension of the withdrawal contracture to resting level.10 Tetrodotoxin (3.0 muM) given before challenge, prevented naloxone from eliciting a withdrawal contracture.11 The inclusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (10 muM) with morphine (10 muM) inhibited the induction of tolerance to morphine.12 These experiments, together with those described earlier, indicate that incubation with opiate induces a dependence in the final cholinergic motor neurones of the myenteric plexus, manifested as a contracture of the longitudinal muscle on removal of opiate or administration of an antagonist. This dependence is associated with tolerance, expressed as a decrease in sensitivity to inhibition by morphine of the electrically-evoked contracture.

1158,31608900.0,Evaluation of the effectiveness of relaxation in lowering the level of anxiety in young adults - a pilot study.,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,"OBJECTIVES: Anxiety is a negative emotion that acts as a mediator between stress stimuli and emotional (physiological) reaction patterns. The myofascial system is particularly sensitive to stress. The aim of this study was to determine which of the 2 popular methods used to reduce psychophysical tension, i.e., soft tissue manipulation and Jacobson's progressive relaxation, is more effective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was conducted at Gdansk University of Physical Education and Sports in the sports psychology laboratory and the manual therapy room. After performing specialist consultations and interviews to exclude potential participants with contraindications to any of the interventions, the final sample included 90 people who were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. In group I, soft tissue techniques were applied, including the techniques of post-isometric muscle relaxation, elements of myofascial relaxation of tissues, and elastic tissue deformation using the Swedish massage limited to the cervicothoracic complex. In group II, Jacobson's progressive relaxation was performed. The training consisted of tightening and relaxing specific muscle groups. The experiment was conducted under an ambulatory condition, consisting of a single physiotherapeutic session (group I) or a single progressive relaxation session using the Jacobson method (group II). The level of anxiety was assessed twice, i.e., immediately before and after the therapy. RESULTS: According to a repeated-measures ANOVA, each therapeutic impact was effective in reducing the level of perceived anxiety. Furthermore, the level of perceived anxiety in group I decreased significantly more than that in group II. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, both the soft tissue manipulation and Jacobson's progressive relaxation techniques were efficient methods of minimizing the negative effects of stress.

We investigated the effects of non-selective PDE inhibitors and selective inhibitors of PDE3 and PDE4 in order to determine the involvement of PDE isoenzymes in the suppression of allergic bronchoconstriction. Macroscopically normal airways from 76 patients were sensitized with IgE-rich sera (>250 u ml(-1)) containing specific antibodies against allergen (Dermatophagoides farinae). Contractile responses of bronchial rings were assessed using standard organ bath techniques. Passive sensitization caused increased contractile responses to allergen, histamine and LTC(4). Non-selective PDE inhibitors (theophylline, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine [IBMX]), a PDE3-selective inhibitor (motapizone), PDE4-selective inhibitors (RP73401, rolipram, AWD 12-281) and a mixed PDE3/4 inhibitor (zardaverine) all significantly relaxed inherent bronchial tone at resting tension and to a similar degree. Theophylline, IBMX, zardaverine and the combination of motapizone and RP73401 inhibited the contractile responses to allergen and LTC(4). Pre-treatment with motapizone, RP73401, rolipram or the methylxanthine adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline, did not significantly decrease responses to either allergen or LTC(4). We conclude that combined inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4, but not selective inhibition of either isoenzyme or antagonism of adenosine receptors, is effective in suppressing allergen-induced contractions of passively sensitized human airways. The relationship between allergen- and LTC(4)-induced responses suggests that PDE inhibitors with PDE3 and PDE4 selectivity are likely to act in part through inhibition of mediator release and not simply through direct relaxant actions on airway smooth muscle.",2000,131,8,1607-18,10.1038/sj.bjp.0703725,#3844,Schmidt 2000,

1161,15705723.0,Changes to respiratory mechanisms during speech as a result of different cues to increase loudness.,J Appl Physiol (1985),"The purpose of the present study was to determine whether different cues to increase loudness in speech result in different internal targets (or goals) for respiratory movement and whether the neural control of the respiratory system is sensitive to changes in the speaker's internal loudness target. This study examined respiratory mechanisms during speech in 30 young adults at comfortable level and increased loudness levels. Increased loudness was elicited using three methods: asking subjects to target a specific sound pressure level, asking subjects to speak twice as loud as comfortable, and asking subjects to speak in noise. All three loud conditions resulted in similar increases in sound pressure level . However, the respiratory mechanisms used to support the increase in loudness differed significantly depending on how the louder speech was elicited. When asked to target at a particular sound pressure level, subjects used a mechanism of increasing the lung volume at which speech was initiated to take advantage of higher recoil pressures. When asked to speak twice as loud as comfortable, subjects increased expiratory muscle tension, for the most part, to increase the pressure for speech. However, in the most natural of the elicitation methods, speaking in noise, the subjects used a combined respiratory approach, using both increased recoil pressures and increased expiratory muscle tension. In noise, an additional target, possibly improving intelligibility of speech, was reflected in the slowing of speech rate and in larger volume excursions even though the speakers were producing the same number of syllables.",2005,98,6,2177-84,10.1152/japplphysiol.01239.2004,#3846,Huber 2005,
1162,20349823.0,"Sonoporation, drug delivery, and gene therapy.",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,"Ultrasound is a very effective modality for drug delivery and gene therapy because energy that is non-invasively transmitted through the skin can be focused deeply into the human body in a specific location and employed to release drugs at that site. Ultrasound cavitation, enhanced by injected microbubbles, perturbs cell membrane structures to cause sonoporation and increases the permeability to bioactive materials. Cavitation events also increase the rate of drug transport in general by augmenting the slow diffusion process with convective transport processes. Drugs and genes can be incorporated into microbubbles, which in turn can target a specific disease site using ligands such as the antibody. Drugs can be released ultrasonically from microbubbles that are sufficiently robust to circulate in the blood and retain their cargo of drugs until they enter an insonated volume of tissue. Local drug delivery ensures sufficient drug concentration at the diseased region while limiting toxicity for healthy tissues. Ultrasound-mediated gene delivery has been applied to heart, blood vessel, lung, kidney, muscle, brain, and tumour with enhanced gene transfection efficiency, which depends on the ultrasonic parameters such as acoustic pressure, pulse length, duty cycle, repetition rate, and exposure duration, as well as microbubble properties such as size, gas species, shell material, interfacial tension, and surface rigidity.

METHODS: Age at implantation of the pump ranged from 1.4 to 16.8 years (mean 8.1 years). The effects of ITB on spasticity in the upper and lower extremities were evaluated using the Ashworth Scale. Data were collected regarding implant site, infection, complication, and body mass index (BMI). Ashworth Scale scores decreased significantly in the upper and lower extremities at 6 and 12 months after pump implantation (p < 0.001). There were four serious system-related complications, all specific to catheters. There were 32 serious procedure-related complications in 21 patients: 11 complications were infections that occurred in nine patients. Four of nine pump-induced infections were treated with pump removal and antibiotic therapy; five infections were treated successfully with antibiotic therapy alone, without pump removal. In children younger than 8 years of age there was a significantly higher incidence of serious procedure-related adverse events than in older children. There was no significant correlation between BMI and the incidence of pump pocket-related complications or infections. CONCLUSIONS: The 10-ml pump can be used therapeutically in small children, particularly those weighing less than 40 lbs, with greater ease and less wound tension, than the conventional 18-ml pump. The incidence of complications associated with the 10-ml pump in younger children appears to be similar to that previously reported with the 18-ml pump in larger-sized children.",2004,101,1 Suppl,64-8,10.3171/ped.2004.101.2.0064,#3848,Albright 2004,
1164,20609377.0,"An intriguing and hitherto unexplained co-occurrence: Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are manifestations of shared inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative (IO&NS) pathways.",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,"There is a significant 'comorbidity' between depression and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Depressive symptoms frequently occur during the course of ME/CFS. Fatigue and somatic symptoms (F&S), like pain, muscle tension, and a flu-like malaise, are key components of depression. At the same time, depression and ME/CFS show major clinical differences, which allow to discriminate them with a 100% accuracy. This paper aims to review the shared pathways that underpin both disorders and the pathways that discriminate them. Numerous studies have shown that depression and ME/CFS are characterized by shared aberrations in inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative (IO&NS) pathways, like systemic inflammation and its long-term sequels, including O&NS-induced damage to fatty acids, proteins and DNA; dysfunctional mitochondria; lowered antioxidant levels, like zinc and coenzyme Q10; autoimmune responses to neoepitopes formed by O&NS; lowered omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels; and increased translocation of gram-negative bacteria. Some IO&NS-related pathways, like the induction of indoleamine 2-3-dioxygenase, neurodegeneration and decreased neurogenesis, are more specific to depression, whereas other pathways, like the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L pathway, are specific to ME/CFS. Most current animal models of depression, e.g. those induced by cytokines, are not reminiscent of human depression but reflect a mixture of depressive and F&S symptoms. The latter symptoms, sometimes called sickness behavior, differ from depression and ME/CFS because the former is a (sub)acute response to infection-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines that aims to enhance recovery, whereas the latter are characterized by long-term sequels in multiple IO&NS pathways. Depression and ME/CFS are not 'comorbid' disorders, but should be regarded as 'co-associated disorders' that are clinical manifestations of shared pathways.",2011,35,3,784-94,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2010.06.023,#3849,Maes 2011,
1165,31660076.0,Exosomes from nicotine-stimulated macrophages accelerate atherosclerosis through miR-21-3p/PTEN-mediated VSMC migration and proliferation.,Theranostics,"Rationale: During the development of atherosclerosis, macrophages secrete exosomes that regulate vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); however, whether nicotine, a major constituent of cigarettes, can modulate this communication in the context of atherogenesis remains to be further studied. In this study, we hypothesized that nicotine induces macrophages to secrete atherogenic exosomes containing microRNAs (miRNAs) to mediate cell-to-cell crosstalk and encourage proatherogenic phenotypes of VSMCs. Methods: In an in vivo study, nicotine was administered subcutaneously to 8-week-old male ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Oil red O and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) were used to stain atherosclerotic lesions. Lesion macrophages, VSMCs and exosomes were stained for CD68, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and CD9, and plaque exosomes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Exosomes derived from control macrophages (M-Exos) and from nicotine-treated macrophages (NM-Exos) were isolated by ultracentrifugation, purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and characterized based on specific morphology and surface markers. The IVIS® Spectrum in vivo imaging system showed the biodistribution of NM-Exos and M-Exos in circulation. Chitosan hydrogel-incorporated exosomes were applied to simulate exosome secretion in situ. Scratch wound assay, transwell assay and EdU staining were conducted to assess the effects of NM-Exos on the migration and proliferation of mouse VSMCs. RNA-seq was performed to determine the miRNA profiles of M-Exos and NM-Exos. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted to detect the expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs. The roles of the candidate miRNA and its target gene were assessed using specific RNA inhibitors, siRNAs and miRNA mimics. Western blotting was used to detect candidate protein expression levels. A dual-luciferase reporting system was utilized to confirm the binding of a specific miRNA to its target gene. Results: Nicotine induced atherosclerotic lesion progression and resulted in plaque exosome retention in vivo. The biodistribution of NM-Exos showed that plaque-resident exosomes might be secreted in situ. VSMCs cocultured in vitro with nicotine-stimulated macrophages presented an increased capacity for migration and proliferation, which was exosome-dependent. In addition, isolated NM-Exos helped promote VSMC migration and proliferation. miRNA profiling showed that miR-21-3p was enriched in NM-Exos, and this miRNA was shown to play a key role in regulating NM-Exos-induced effects by directly targeting phosphatase and tension homologue (PTEN). Conclusion: Exosomal miR-21-3p from nicotine-treated macrophages may accelerate the development of atherosclerosis by increasing VSMC migration and proliferation through its target PTEN.",2019,9,23,6901-6919,10.7150/thno.37357,#3850,Zhu 2019,Atherosclerosis
1166,30969902.0,The Relationship Between Physiological Mechanisms and the Self-Perception of Vocal Effort.,J Speech Lang Hear Res,"Purpose This study aimed to examine the relationship between a large set of hypothesized physiological measures of vocal effort and self-ratings of vocal effort. Method Twenty-six healthy adults modulated speech rate and vocal effort during repetitions of the utterance /ifi/, followed by self-perceptual ratings of vocal effort on a visual analog scale. Physiological measures included (a) intrinsic laryngeal tension via kinematic stiffness ratios determined from high-speed laryngoscopy, (b) extrinsic suprahyoid and infrahyoid laryngeal tension via normalized percent activations and durations derived from surface electromyography, (c) supraglottal compression via expert visual-perceptual ratings, and (d) subglottal pressure via magnitude of neck surface vibrations from an accelerometer signal. Results Individual statistical models revealed that all of the physiological predictors, except for kinematic stiffness ratios, were significantly predictive of self-ratings of vocal effort. However, a combined regression model analysis yielded only 3 significant predictors: subglottal pressure, mediolateral supraglottal compression, and the normalized percent activation of the suprahyoid muscles (adjusted R (2) = .60). Conclusions Vocal effort manifests as increases in specific laryngeal physiological measures. Further work is needed to examine these measures in combination with other contributing factors, as well as in speakers with dysphonia.",2019,62,4,815-834,10.1044/2018_JSLHR-S-18-0205,#3851,McKenna 2019,
1167,24533429.0,Autonomic arousal and experimentally induced pain: a critical review of the literature.,Pain Res Manag,"BACKGROUND: Autonomic arousal frequently is assumed to be a component of the pain response, perhaps because physiological mechanisms connecting pain and autonomic reactivity can be easily conceptualized. The evidence clarifying autonomic responses specific to painful stimulation, however, has been rather sporadic and lacks coherence; thus, a summary and critical review is needed in this area. OBJECTIVES: To summarize and integrate findings from 39 experimental investigations from 1970 to 2012 of pain-induced autonomic arousal in humans. METHODS: Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched for relevant articles. References from these articles were also considered for review. RESULTS: Painful stimuli increase respiration rate, induce muscle tension, intensify electrodermal activity and dilate the pupils. Cardiovascular activity also increases, but the pattern displayed in response to pain is complex; peripheral vasoconstriction and sympathetically mediated cardiac responses are most typical. Additionally, autonomic expression of pain shows inconsistent relations with verbal and overt motor responses. CONCLUSIONS: Autonomic arousal can be legitimately measured and modified as one facet of the pain response. Future research should particularly focus on increasing sample size and broadening the diversity of participants. To improve the ability to compare and contrast findings across studies, as well as to increase the applicability of laboratory findings to naturalistic pain, investigators also must enhance experimental design by increasing uniformity or accounting for differences in methodology. Finally, further work remains to utilize more specific assessments of autonomic response and to assess relationships of autonomic reactivity with other cognitive (e.g., attention) and affective (e.g., anxiety) variables.",2014,19,3,159-67,10.1155/2014/536859,#3852,Kyle 2014,
1168,30228216.0,Changes in neuromuscular structure and functions of human colon during ageing are region-dependent.,Gut,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if human colonic neuromuscular functions decline with increasing age. DESIGN: Looking for non-specific changes in neuromuscular function, a standard burst of electrical field stimulation (EFS) was used to evoke neuronally mediated (cholinergic/nitrergic) contractions/relaxations in ex vivomuscle strips of human ascending and descending colon, aged 35-91 years (macroscopically normal tissue; 239 patients undergoing cancer resection). Then, to understand mechanisms of change, numbers and phenotype of myenteric neurons (30 306 neurons stained with different markers), densities of intramuscular nerve fibres (51 patients in total) and pathways involved in functional changes were systematically investigated (by immunohistochemistry and use of pharmacological tools) in elderly (≥70 years) and adult (35-60 years) groups. RESULTS: With increasing age, EFS was more likely to evoke muscle relaxation in ascending colon instead of contraction (linear regression: n=109, slope 0.49%±0.21%/year, 95% CI), generally uninfluenced by comorbidity or use of medications. Similar changes were absent in descending colon. In the elderly, overall numbers of myenteric and neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunoreactive neurons and intramuscular nerve densities were unchanged in ascending and descending colon, compared with adults. In elderly ascending, not descending, colon numbers of cell bodies exhibiting choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity increased compared with adults (5.0±0.6 vs 2.4±0.3 neurons/mm myenteric plexus, p=0.04). Cholinergically mediated contractions were smaller in elderly ascending colon compared with adults (2.1±0.4 and 4.1±1.1 g-tension/g-tissue during EFS; n=25/14; p=0.04); there were no changes in nitrergic function or in ability of the muscle to contract/relax. Similar changes were absent in descending colon. CONCLUSION: In ascending not descending colon, ageing impairs cholinergic function.",2019,68,7,1210-1223,10.1136/gutjnl-2018-316279,#3853,Broad 2019,ageing
1169,8026041.0,Preferential vasoconstriction to cysteinyl leukotrienes in the human saphenous vein compared with the internal mammary artery. Implications for graft performance.,Circulation,"BACKGROUND: Platelet aggregation with the release of their vasoactive mediators is an important factor contributing to the patency of coronary bypass grafts. However, the role of leukocyte-derived mediators on graft performance is unclear. Leukotrienes (LTs) are proinflammatory mediators released from a variety of leukocytes that possess both vasoactive and mitogenic properties. We have therefore compared the effects of the cysteinyl LTs (C4, D4, and E4) on the human saphenous vein (SV) and human internal mammary artery (IMA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Human SVs from 43 patients (mean age, 58 years) and IMAs from 33 patients (mean age, 57 years) were obtained from individuals undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery for coronary artery disease. The samples were set up in organ baths to record changes in vessel wall tension. In undistended SVs the cysteinyl LTs elicited concentration-dependent contractions. The Emax for LTE4 (4.23 +/- 1.0 mN; n = 6) was significantly less than that observed with either LTC4 (25.7 +/- 4.01 mN; n = 7; P < .001) or LTD4 (26.19 +/- 3.16 mN; n = 7; P < .001). In addition, the LTD4 receptor antagonist ICI 198615 (30 nmol/L) significantly inhibited the LTD4 concentration-response curve but not the LTC4 responses. Furthermore, treatment of the SV with acivicin (0.05 mmol/L), a gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase inhibitor, caused a significant rightward displacement of the LTC4 concentration-response curve. In contrast, LTC4 and LTD4 produced a response in IMAs from only 3 of 29 patients. LTC4 and LTD4 produced small contractions, of which the maximum responses were 3.28 +/- 1.92 mN (n = 5) and 3.12 +/- 1.38 mN (n = 5). LTE4 produced no responses in the IMA. Experiments in which the SV was pretreated with L-NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 10(-4) mol/L) or indomethacin (10(-5) mol/L) or was denuded of endothelium had no significant effect on the Emax values for LTE4. Also, the IMA remained unresponsive to cysteinyl leukotrienes after treatment with L-NMMA or indomethacin or endothelium removal. In vitro autoradiography localized specific [3H]-LTC4 and [3H]-LTD4 binding sites (putative receptors) to the smooth muscle cells of both SV and IMA, with greater binding to the SV. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that there is a preferential contraction to LTs in SV compared with IMA. This difference in smooth muscle cell reactivity to the cysteinyl LTs suggests that endogenous LT production from circulating or infiltrating leukocytes may be an important factor contributing to graft function.",1994,90,1,515-24,10.1161/01.cir.90.1.515,#3854,Allen 1994,

The purpose of this study was to compare sexually abused adolescent females to adolescent females who have not ben sexually abused with respect to incidence of emotional disorders and somatic symptoms. METHODS: A convenience sample of females, ages 12-17, included 11 identified victims of sexual abuse and 11 nonabused adolescents. A descriptive design using multiple methods of data collection: interview questions, self-report questionnaires, and projective drawings. FINDINGS: The sexually abused adolescents scored significantly higher than the adolescents who had no history of sexual abuse on specific sub scales (anxiety, muscle tension, cognitive disorganization) and on the total scale scores of both the SOS and the SCL-90.

1171,22703374.0,Outcomes of a headache-specific cross-sectional multidisciplinary treatment program.,Headache,"AIM: Chronic headache is a disabling disorder that is frequently poorly managed in general clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: To investigate primary (headache frequency in days/month) and secondary (headache-related disability, lost work/school time, anxiety and depression, amount and intake frequency of acute medication) 12-month outcomes of a headache-specific cross-sectional outpatient and inpatient multidisciplinary treatment program using a dedicated computer system for data collection and corresponding between integrated care team in a tertiary headache center and practicing headache specialists. BACKGROUND: A need for integrated headache care using comprehensive and standardized assessment for diagnosis of headache, psychiatric comorbidity, and burden of disease exists. There are little published data on long-term efficacy of multidisciplinary treatment programs for chronic headache. DESIGN: A prospective, observational, 12-month, follow-up study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Prospectively recruited consecutive patients with frequent difficult-to-treat headaches (n = 201; 63 migraine, 11 tension-type headache, 59 combined migraine/tension-type headache, and 68 medication overuse headache) were enrolled. Outcome measures included prospective headache diaries, a medication survey, Migraine Disability Assessment, 12-item short form health survey, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: The primary outcome of a reduction of ≥50% of headache frequency (days/month) was observed in 62.7%. Mean headache frequency decreased from 14.4 ± 8.2 to 7.6 ± 8.3 days/month, P < .0001. Secondary outcomes improved significantly in the total cohort and all headache subgroups. Predictors for good outcome were younger age, few days lost at work/school, and familiarity with progressive muscle relaxation therapy at baseline.

1172,25059052.0,[The effect of muscle load on the post-prandial content of blood serum hydrolytic enzymes in men with different levels and specificity of daily physical activity].,Vopr Pitan,"The article presents data on the effect of the combined action of food and muscular load on the level of hydrolytic enzymes in blood serum of healthy young people 18-22 years old, with various levels of adaptation to the effects of physical activity. The first group (n = 8) of the examined persons were high-qualified athletes developing their speed and power qualities in anaerobic energetic regime (Greco-Roman wrestling, sambo, judo). The second group (n = 8) were athletes developing endurance in aerobic energetic regime (skiers, track and field athletes--stayers, biathletes). The control group (n = 8) consists of non-athletes. The content of hydrolytic enzymes: pepsinogen-1, pepsinogen-2, the activity of pancreatic alpha-amylase, lipase were defined by ELISA. The content and activity of ferments were defined in blood serum, taken in the morning fasting and post-prandial period in dynamics after 15, 45, 75 and 105 min after administration of the test breakfast (100 g of ground boiled beef and 200 ml of unsweetened tea) in a state of relative physiological rest and after the veloergometric exercise muscular load (at the level of 60-70% of maximal oxygen consumption) during an hour (in 7-14 days). Multidirectional changes of concentration of investigated enzymes in the postprandial period among examined were defined in the conditions of relative physiological rest and under the action of the muscular tension. For groups of athletes higher alpha-amylase and lipase blood activity were characteristic both in a state of physiological rest and under the action of muscular load. It was also determined that after the muscular tension there was an increase in activity of alpha-amylase at 75 min and lipases at 15 min relative to background indicators at non-athletes. For the athletes from the second group the increase (p < 0.01) relative to background data of activity as alpha-amylase as lipase on an empty stomach was noted. However postprandial (15-45 min) alpha-amylase (p < 0.05) and lipase (p < 0.001) activity was significantly decreased. At relatively high rates of fasting alpha-amylase activity there was a decrease of its level in the postprandial period, whereas at low rates of enzyme activity on an empty stomach its increase can be occurred in the postprandial period. Lipase activity changed in groups of athletes unidirectionally, it decreased (p < 0.01) in athletes of the first group at 45 min. and in athletes from the second group at 15-105 min (p < 0.001). For athletes of the first group, also as well for non-athletes, significantly lower blood lipase activity was noted at rest and in the conditions of muscular tension. After a physical load lipase activity in athletes from the second group was decreased throughout the postprandial period. Blood serum concentration of pepsinogen-1 and pepsinogen-2 were also significantly higher in the groups of athletes, but only in fasting conditions. After receiving the breakfast the content of these proenzymes were significantly lower in athletes comparable to the control group. Pepsinogen-2 concentration had a strong tendency to significant decrease after muscular exercise in all athletes throughout the postprandial period (at 15 and 105 min). For the athletes from the first group a decrease of pepsinogen-2 concentration to the values accepted as a norm (4-22 microg/l) was tended. The obtained data suggest that the revealed changes are associated with a sport orientation and a level of daily physical activity.",2014,83,1,20-6,,#3857,Griaznykh 2014,

The dependence between the level and characteristics of daily physical activity and reactivity of the secretory apparatus of the gastric glands in the recovery period after the muscle load has been established. The high reactivity of the secretory activity of digestive glands is typical for individuals with high level of daily physical activity. The differences of the functional stability of the secretion's mechanisms of various components of gastric juice under the influence of physical exercise and in recovery have been revealed. The greatest stability of the secretory mechanisms of digestive glands has been discovered at athletes practicing with the development of endurance--at skiers. Heterochronous reducing reactions of gastric and pancreatic secretion after physical stress have been defined. The reduction of secretion's mechanisms of gastric juice ingredients and the electrolyte and acid composition of digestive juices isn't simultaneous: the first order is for ferment's secretion. The inverse relationship between the content of digestive enzymes pepsinogen-1 and -2 in blood's serum and the concentration of proteolytic enzymes in the gastric content has been found at persons with various degrees of adaptation to the muscular tension.,2012,38,1,110-8,,#3858,Griaznykh 2012,
1174,19501454.0,Current technique of open intrafascial nerve-sparing retropubic prostatectomy.,Eur Urol,"BACKGROUND: Open nerve-sparing retropubic prostatectomy (nsRP) is still the most common surgical approach for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. Even though the principles of the technique and its oncological efficacy have often been published, ongoing refinements allow further improvements in functional outcome and morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To describe our current technique of open nsRP with data addressing urinary continence, potency, cancer control rates, and perioperative morbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Our analyses relied on 1150 patients who were treated with nsRP in the Martini-Clinic by two high-volume surgeons from April 2005 to December 2007. SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Key elements are a selective ligation of the dorsal vein complex and early release of the neurovascular bundles using a high anterior tension- and energy-free intrafascial technique. During dissection of the urethra, its posterior insertion at Denonvilliers' fascia (DF) is preserved. DF is left in situ, and it is selectively opened above the seminal vesicles (SV). The SV are completely removed inside DF, and five muscle-sparing interrupted sutures are used for anastomosis. MEASUREMENTS: Functional and oncological outcome data were prospectively assessed using validated questionnaires. Moreover, intra- and perioperative morbidity were evaluated. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Age and extent of nerve-sparing approach influenced urinary continence and potency. Complete urinary continence 1 yr after nsRP was found in 97.4% (men <60 yr) to 84.1% (men >70 yr) of patients. In preoperative potent men, erections sufficient for intercourse were reported between 84-92% and 58.3-70% of patients following bilateral and unilateral nerve sparing, respectively. Median blood loss was 580 ml (range: 130-1800 ml), and the transfusion rate was 4.3%. Median operative time was 165 min (range: 85-210 min). In organ-confined cancers, recurrence-free survival and cancer-specific-survival 10 yr after retropubic prostatectomy were 87% and 98.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Open intrafascial nsRP combines excellent long-term cancer control rates with superior functional outcome and a low morbidity.",2009,56,2,317-24,10.1016/j.eururo.2009.05.044,#3859,BudÃ¤us 2009,
1175,25008376.0,Task-specific singing dystonia: vocal instability that technique cannot fix.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVES: Singer's dystonia is a rare variation of focal laryngeal dystonia presenting only during specific tasks in the singing voice. It is underdiagnosed since it is commonly attributed to technique problems including increased muscle tension, register transition, or wobble. Singer's dystonia differs from technique-related issues in that it is task- and/or pitch-specific, reproducible and occurs independently from the previously mentioned technical issues.This case series compares and contrasts profiles of four patients with singer's dystonia to increase our knowledge of this disorder. METHODS: This retrospective case series includes a detailed case history, results of singing evaluations from individual voice teachers, review of singing voice samples by a singing voice specialist, evaluation by a laryngologist with endoscopy and laryngeal electromyography (LEMG), and spectral analysis of the voice samples by a speech-language pathologist. RESULTS: Results demonstrate the similarities and unique differences of individuals with singer's dystonia. Response to treatment and singing status varied from nearly complete relief of symptoms with botulinum toxin injections to minor relief of symptoms and discontinuation of singing. CONCLUSIONS: The following are the conclusions from this case series: (1) singer's dystonia exists as a separate entity from technique issues, (2) singer's dystonia is consistent with other focal task-specific dystonias found in musicians, (3) correctly diagnosing singer's dystonia allows singer's access to medical treatment of dystonia and an opportunity to modify their singing repertoire to continue singing with the voice they have, and (4) diagnosis of singer's dystonia requires careful sequential multidisciplinary evaluation to isolate the instability and confirm dystonia by LEMG and spectral voice analysis.",2015,29,1,71-8,10.1016/j.jvoice.2014.04.011,#3860,Halstead 2015,Focal taskâspecific dystonia

DESIGN: The study design was a prospective, 6-month observational, pragmatic study. SETTING: There were 85 shiatsu practitioners in three countries involved in the study: Austria, Spain, and the United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: There were 948 clients receiving shiatsu from 1 of these practitioners. INTERVENTIONS: Shiatsu as delivered by the practitioner in routine practice. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes measures were symptom severity, changes in health care use (baseline, 3 and 6 months), shiatsu-specific effects, uptake of advice (3 and 6 months), achieved expectations and occurrence of adverse events (4-6 days after first session, 3 and 6 months). RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty-three (633) clients provided full follow-up data (a response rate of 67%). A typical shiatsu user was female, in her 40s, in paid employment, and had used shiatsu before. At ""first-ever"" use, the most typical reason for trying shiatsu was ""out of curiosity."" At ""today's"" session, the dominant reason was health maintenance. The most mentioned symptom groups were problems with ""muscles, joints, or body structure,"" ""tension/stress,"" and ""low energy/fatigue."" Symptom scores improved significantly over the 6 months (all symptom groups, Austria and the United Kingdom; two symptom groups, Spain), with moderate effect sizes (0.66-0.77) for ""tension or stress"" and ""body structure problems"" (Austria, the United Kingdom), and small effect sizes (0.32-0.47) for the other symptom groups (Spain, 0.28-0.43 for four groups). Previous users reported significant symptom improvement from ""first ever"" to baseline with moderate effect sizes. Across countries, substantial proportions (> or = 60%) agreed or agreed strongly with shiatsu-specific benefits. At 6 months, 77%-80% indicated that they had made changes to their lifestyle as a result of having shiatsu, and reductions in the use of conventional medicine (16%-22%) and medication (15%-34%). Ten (10) adverse events were reported by 9 clients (1.4%); none of these clients ceased shiatsu. CONCLUSIONS: Clients receiving shiatsu reported improvements in symptom severity and changes in their health-related behaviour that they attributed to their treatment, suggestive of a role for shiatsu in maintaining and enhancing health.",2008,14,8,921-30,10.1089/acm.2008.0085,#3861,Long 2008,

1178,29194437.0,An introduction to the 'Psycho-Physiological-Stress-Test' (PPST)-A standardized instrument for evaluating stress reactions.,PLoS One,"Using a standardized instrument to evaluate patients' stress reactions has become more important in daily clinical routines. Different signs or symptoms of stress are often unilaterally explored: the physiological, psychological or social aspects of stress disorders are each viewed on a single dimension. However, all dimensions afflict patients who have persistent health problems due to chronic stress. Therefore, it is important to use a multidimensional approach to acquire data. The 'Psycho-Physiological-Stress-Test' (PPST) was established to achieve a comprehensive understanding of stress and was further developed at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin in collaboration with the Psychological Department of Freie Universität Berlin. The PPST includes a series of varying stress phases, embedded in two periods of rest. Physiological and psychological parameters are simultaneously measured throughout the test session. Specifically, the PPST activates the sympathetic stress axis, which is measured by heart rate, blood pressure, respiration depth and rate, electro dermal activation and muscle tension (frontalis, masseter, trapezius). Psychological data are simultaneously collected, and include performance, motivation, emotion and behavior. After conducting this diagnostic test, it is possible to identify individual stress patterns that can be discussed with the individual patient to develop and recommend (outpatient) treatment strategies. This paper introduces the PPST as a standardized way to evaluate stress reactions by presenting the results from a sample of psychosomatic inpatients (n = 139) who were treated in Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. We observed that the varying testing conditions provoked adjusted changes in the different physiological parameters and psychological levels.",2017,12,12,e0187859,10.1371/journal.pone.0187859,#3863,Neureiter 2017,
1179,31525635.0,Baseline of upper teeth: (a) Control organ for spatial navigation? (b) Weak point for misaligned posture and pain?,Med Hypotheses,"Our observations question both the current doctrine of spatial orientation as processed by vestibular, visual and proprioceptive impressions as well as the horizontal alignment of the eye axis. Indeed our observations suggest spatial orientation as a physically based, largely mechanically transmitted interaction between individual and environment. It is controlled by an interface defined by the baseline of upper teeth. It simultaneously constitutes both body and environment acting as an integral part of that environment. Consequently, the baseline of upper teeth is part of the aforementioned environment. Instead of the eye axis during spatial orientation it aligns the true horizontal absolutely. This was tested by fixing a cross to upper teeth. While walking, running and jumping it did not deviate by more than 2° from the external axis. Subsequently, we inclined the baseline of upper teeth by inserting an asymmetric wafer so that it angulated the eye axis. Immediately, head, visual and vestibular axes tilted unstably with misaligned body posture. Only the indicative cross remained stably aligned to the external axes. The person felt ""upright"", not noticing his posture had changed. He was then instructed to straighten his shoulders and trunk until his posture was objectively nearly upright again. The voluntary correction caused the indicative cross to tilt. The person felt uneven while being more upright. We concluded that the automatic posture works by ""synchronizing"" the baseline of upper teeth to the external axis and that the synchronized position is supported by the vestibular system. Benefit of an interface is that the body's movements in the environment simultaneously happen within the baseline of upper teeth. Therein the vectors of the body and the environment are calculated to remain in balance. This model introduces the transmission of the vector information to postural muscles by the dura mater, controlled by tension between C0-C2. The information is skewed by bony dislocations between C0-C2 caused by an inclination of the interface. The resulting misalignments of posture are foreseeable and specifically correspond to the type of inclination. They occur in a broad section of the population. Diagnosed as muscular weakness, they may cause therapy resistant common diseases like back and joint pain after 5-10 years. Following our observations, the inclination of the baseline of upper teeth originates from inattentive changes in the length of upper teeth in dental treatment. Multiple treatments optimizing teeth length in long term patients improved the patients' situation.",2019,133,,109391,10.1016/j.mehy.2019.109391,#3864,Kapp 2019,

Blood phobics (24 adults with extreme Mutilation Questionnaire scores) and 24 nonphobics completed several psychological measures and viewed one of two 60 sec surgery scenes and a 60 sec neutral scene in counterbalanced order. Subjective, psychophysiologic, and motoric measures of affect were assessed. On questionnaires, phobics reported greater anxiety sensitivity, empathic distress, fear and insecurity, and nightmares, but no difference in autonomic arousal, muscle tension, motion sickness, or other empathy domains. During surgery scenes, phobics had more negative affect than controls; however, phobics were more anxious during only one of the two surgeries, and often only when the surgery was presented prior to the neutral scene. Fainting did not occur, and self-reported feelings of faintness were unrelated to blood pressure changes.

1181,18625126.0,Otolaryngological perspective on patients with throat symptoms and laryngeal irritation.,Curr Gastroenterol Rep,"The diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is increasingly common in otolaryngology practice. Patients with nonspecific throat and voice symptoms, such as throat clearing, hoarseness, cough, sore throat, and globus, are frequently treated empirically with antireflux medication by otolaryngologists and primary care physicians. Physical findings such as laryngeal erythema, edema, and posterior laryngeal mucosal thickening are also frequently attributed to LPR. The literature has been inconsistent, with few prospective, randomized trials showing efficacy for this clinical practice. Because of the lack of specific signs and symptoms of LPR, clinicians should be aware of other potential causes for these clinical presentations. Recently published studies describe the association between allergy or asthma and many of the same symptoms attributed to reflux disease. Muscle tension dysphonia can also present with hoarseness and symptoms of throat irritation. Although LPR can cause the symptoms and signs described previously, it should not be the only diagnosis considered by the evaluating physician. Failure to consider other possible causes may result in unnecessary treatment and potential delay in diagnosis. This article discusses this topic, citing some of the pertinent literature published over the past 2 years.",2008,10,3,195-9,10.1007/s11894-008-0043-6,#3866,Garrett 2008,
1182,19812983.0,Listeria as an enteroinvasive gastrointestinal pathogen.,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,"The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of listeriosis, a highly fatal opportunistic foodborne infection. Listeria spp. are isolated from a diversity of environmental sources, including soil, water, effluents, a large variety of foods, and the feces of humans and animals. Recent outbreaks demonstrated that L. monocytogenes can cause gastroenteritis in otherwise healthy individuals and more severe invasive disease in immunocompromised patients. Common symptoms include fever, watery diarrhea, nausea, headache, and pains in joints and muscles. The intestinal tract is the major portal of entry for L. monocytogenes, whereby strains penetrate the mucosal tissue either directly, via invasion of enterocytes, or indirectly, via active penetration of the Peyer's patches. Studies have revealed the strategy taken by the bacteria to overcome changes in oxygen tension, osmolarity, acidity, and the sterilizing effects of bile or antimicrobial peptides to adapt to conditions in the gut. In addition, L. monocytogenes has evolved species-specific strategies for intestinal entry by exploiting the interaction between the internalin protein and its receptor E-cadherin, or inducing diarrhea and an inflammatory response via the activity of its hemolytic toxin, listeriolysin. The ability of these bacteria to survive in bile-rich environments, and to induce depletion of sentinel cells such as Paneth cells that monitor the luminal burden of commensal bacteria, suggest strategies that have evolved to promote intestinal survival. Preexisting gastrointestinal disease may be a risk factor for infection of the gastrointestinal tract with L. monocytogenes. Currently, there is enough evidence to warrant consideration of L. monocytogenes as a possible etiology in outbreaks of febrile gastroenteritis, and for further studies to examine the genetic structure of Listeria strains that have a propensity to cause gastrointestinal versus systemic infections.",2009,337,,173-95,10.1007/978-3-642-01846-6_6,#3867,Barbuddhe 2009,
1183,31721649.0,Protein kinase A activity is regulated by actomyosin contractility during cell migration and is required for durotaxis.,Mol Biol Cell,"Dynamic subcellular regulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity is important for the motile behavior of many cell types, yet the mechanisms governing PKA activity during cell migration remain largely unknown. The motility of SKOV-3 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells has been shown to be dependent both on localized PKA activity and, more recently, on mechanical reciprocity between cellular tension and extracellular matrix rigidity. Here, we investigated the possibility that PKA is regulated by mechanical signaling during migration. We find that localized PKA activity in migrating cells rapidly decreases upon inhibition of actomyosin contractility (specifically, of myosin ATPase, Rho kinase, or myosin light-chain kinase activity). Moreover, PKA activity is spatially and temporally correlated with cellular traction forces in migrating cells. Additionally, PKA is rapidly and locally activated by mechanical stretch in an actomyosin contractility-dependent manner. Finally, inhibition of PKA activity inhibits mechanically guided migration, also known as durotaxis. These observations establish PKA as a locally regulated effector of cellular mechanotransduction and as a regulator of mechanically guided cell migration.",2020,31,1,45-58,10.1091/mbc.E19-03-0131,#3868,McKenzie 2020,
1184,6459406.0,"Strategies of arousal control: biofeedback, meditation, and motivation.",J Exp Psychol Gen,"A series of four experiments assessed the effects of instructions to lower heart rate on heart rate change and general arousal reduction. Various conditions of biofeedback, cognitive load, incentive, knowledge of results, and the experimenter-subject relationship were tested. Experiment 1 compared physiological responses to the delivery of direct organ feedback (i.e., heart rate) with responses to electromyographic biofeedback from the frontalis muscle area and with responses to a nonfeedback tracking task. The results suggest that neither heart rate nor muscle tension feedback is an especially powerful method for achieving sustained reductions in heart rate. Furthermore, although some specificity of physiologic pattern is apparent, biofeedback is no more effective in lowering general activation level than simple instructions to relax accompanied by a general knowledge of results. The second experiment was designed to assess the role of cognitive load in arousal reduction. Heart rate biofeedback was compared with a procedure involving minimal external information processing--the secular meditation exercise of Wallace and Benson. The results indicated a clear superiority for the meditation strategy in effecting reductions in cardiac rate and lowering activation. However, in a third experiment, meditation subjects lowered heart rate much less than observed in the previous study, and this time the reduction did not exceed that achieved by feedback subjects. Subsequent analysis suggested that the quality of the subject-experimenter relationship (active-supportive vs. formal-distant) was a significant variable in accounting for outcome differences. The above hypothesis was supported by a fourth experiment. Under conditions of high subject-experimenter involvement, the superior meditation performance of Experiment 2 was reproduced; under low-involvement conditions the Experiment 3 result of no difference between training groups was obtained. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of any method for achieving relaxation (or physiological control) rests on a complex interaction between informational and motivational imperatives of the stimulus context and definable aspects of the interpersonal exchange between subject and experimenter. This research raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the usual biofeedback paradigm as an aid to arousal reduction and the cost efficiency of its applications in the clinical situation. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the great power in relaxation experiments of psychosocial and other moderator variables, and signal the practical difficulty of their control when these variables appear to be as potent in changing physiology as the primary training methods.",1981,110,4,518-46,10.1037//0096-3445.110.4.518,#3869,Cuthbert 1981,

The patients were divided into two groups. One group first received classical Chinese needle acupuncture for 5 weeks, and the other was given a placebo procedure; after a 2-week interval, the procedures were reversed. A single-blind cross-over design was used. Acupuncture was given by a Chinese otolaryngologist around the ear as well as at distal points on the extremities. Placebo consisted of mock electrical stimulation via surface electrodes connected to a Chinese electro-acupuncture stimulator which delivered a weak sound and a light flash at a frequency of 2 Hz but no current to the surface electrodes. The effect was evaluated by the use of visual analogue scales. No significant difference between acupuncture and placebo was found in annoyance, awareness or loudness of the tinnitus. Many patients indicated a preference for acupuncture due to unspecific effects such as improved sleep, decreased muscle tension and improved blood circulation. It is concluded that acupuncture has no specific alleviating effect on noise-induced tinnitus.",1994,33,6,351-60,10.3109/00206099409071892,#3870,Axelsson 1994,

The muscle-isoform of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-A) constitutes a major checkpoint for the switch to anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore we investigated the combination of a new LDH-A inhibitor (NHI-1) with gemcitabine in MPM cell lines. Under hypoxia (O(2) tension of 1%) the cell growth inhibitory effects of gemcitabine, were reduced, as demonstrated by a 5- to 10-fold increase in IC(50)s. However, the simultaneous addition of NHI-1 was synergistic (combination index < 1). Flow cytometry demonstrated that hypoxia caused a G1 arrest, whereas the combination of NHI-1 significantly increased gemcitabine-induced cell death. Finally, the mRNA expression levels of the human equilibrative transporter-1 (hENT1) were significantly down-regulated under hypoxia, but treatment with NHI-1 was associated with a recovery of hENT1 expression. In conclusion, our data show that hypoxia increased MPM resistance to gemcitabine. However, cell death induction and modulation of the key transporter in gemcitabine uptake may contribute to the synergistic interaction of gemcitabine with the LDH-A inhibitor NHI-1 and support further studies for the rational development of this combination.",2016,35,12-Oct,643-651,10.1080/15257770.2016.1149193,#3871,Giovannetti 2016,Anticancer nucleosides
1187,8968363.0,Inhibition of testosterone 5 alpha-reductase: evidence for tissue-specific regulation of thromboxane A2 receptors.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"Testosterone has been implicated as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) may be an important pathophysiologic mediator for them. Testosterone has been shown to increase TXA2 receptor density in several cell types. Testosterone is reduced at the 5 alpha position to its active metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, by 5 alpha-reductase. We determined the effects of epristeride, a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, on the density of TXA2 receptors in rat aortic smooth muscle cells and human erythroleukemia cells, a megakaryocyte-like cell, in vitro, and in rat platelets and aortic membranes in vivo. In rat aortic smooth muscle cells, epristeride significantly (P < .01, n = 5) blocked the effect of testosterone to increase TXA2 receptor density (Bmax: 44 +/- 3, 76 +/- 7, 48 +/- 4 and 46 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein, for control cells, cells treated with testosterone (200 nM), cells treated with testosterone and epristeride (10 nM) and cells treated with epristeride, respectively. Epristeride did not block the effect of testosterone in human erythroleukemia cells. Treatment of male rats with epristeride for 2 weeks significantly (P < .01) decreased TXA2 receptor density in aortic membranes (41 +/- 3 for vehicle, n = 10; 27 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein for epristeride, n = 11) but did not significantly change TXA2 receptor density in platelets. Maximum contractile responses of rat aortas to U46619, a TXA2 mimetic, were significantly (P < .001) lower in epristeride-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats (4.2 +/- 0.1 for vehicle, n = 16, 3.0 +/- 0.2 g tension for epristeride, n = 15).

1188,20943419.0,Minimally invasive proximal biceps tenodesis: an anatomical study for optimal placement and safe surgical technique.,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,"BACKGROUND: An anatomic study specifically investigating the optimal location for proximal biceps tenodesis and detailing the topographic relationship to neurovascular structures has not been conducted. METHODS: Twelve cadaveric upper extremities were dissected to identify the proximal biceps musculotendinous junction and topographic relationships to neighboring neurovascular structures. RESULTS: The musculotendinous junction of the long head of the biceps tendon was on average 2.2 cm distal to the superior border and 3.1 cm proximal from the inferior border of the pectoralis major tendon. The musculocutaneous nerve was on average 2.6 cm medial to the long head of the biceps at the musculotendinous junction. The distance from the lesser tuberosity to the musculotendinous junction of the long head of the biceps averaged 5.4 cm. The distance from the anterior humeral circumflex vessels to the musculotendinous junction of the long head of the biceps was 4.6 cm on average. The distance from the musculotendinous junction of the long head of the biceps to the musculocutaneous nerve as it pierces the coracobrachialis was 4.6 cm. CONCLUSION: In order to restore the appropriate length-tension relationship of the biceps muscle, proximal biceps tenodesis should possibly be placed closer to the superior border of the pectoralis major tendon than previously thought. The lesser tuberosity can be used as a tactile landmark for appropriate intraoperative placement. Although there is a relatively safe ""buffer zone"" between the location of the tenodesis and adjacent neurovascular structures, extreme caution must be used.",2011,20,3,477-80,10.1016/j.jse.2010.08.002,#3873,Jarrett 2011,
1189,22414569.0,Rehabilitative management of swallowing and oral-motor movements in patients with tetanus of a public service in Brazil.,Acta Trop,"When looking at developing countries, the prolonged intensive medical and nursing care required by many patients places extra demands on an already stretched healthcare budget. The purpose of this study was to verify the effectiveness of a systematic rehabilitative program for swallowing and oral-motor movements in intensive care unit patients with the diagnosis of tetanus. Forty-five patients who were clinically diagnosed with tetanus were included in the study. Participants were divided in two groups: GI - consisted of 18 tetanus patients who were consecutively admitted to the infectious disease ICU from January 2002 to December 2005, prior to the existence of a systematic swallowing and oral-motor intervention; GII - consisted of 27 tetanus patients who were consecutively admitted to the infectious disease ICU from January 2006 to December 2009 and were submitted to a specific rehabilitative management of swallowing and of the oral-motor movements. Results indicate that the proposed rehabilitative program reduced by approximately 50% the time patients remained in the ICU. The significant improvement observed in patients with tetanus who were submitted to the rehabilitative program for swallowing and oral-motor movements occurred in conjunction with a reduction in the amount of time necessary to reintroduce oral feeding, to decannulate and to remove the feeding tubes. In conclusion, swallowing/muscle exercise, in patients with severe/very severe tetanus, seem to promote the remission of muscle tension and seem to maximize functional swallowing.",2012,122,3,241-6,10.1016/j.actatropica.2012.02.069,#3874,Mangilli 2012,
1190,33272615.0,"Bilateral ureteral endometriosis-an indolent, aggressive, and dangerous condition.",Fertil Steril,"OBJECTIVE: To describe an unusual bilateral ureteral reimplantation due to endometriosis and to provide a flowchart of conservative decision making. DESIGN: Video description of a case, demonstrating a step-by-step explanation of the decision planning and description of the surgical steps in a female patient with bilateral ureteral endometriosis who had previously undergone operation for bowel endometriosis, and who presented with extensive disease in the posterior compartment with no symptoms besides bilateral renal function disruption. The study was reviewed and approved by the Hospital Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo Institutional Review Board. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the ureter has an incidence of 0.1% to 1%, normally affecting the lower one-third of its segment, up to 4 cm above the vesicoureteric junction. Bilateral ureteral involvement occurs in 9% of cases. The absence of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis of this condition challenging. Lumbar pain develops when its involvement is complicated by marked obstruction with impaired renal function. Decompressive surgery is mandatory. The necessity of ureteroneocystostomy increases along with the severity of hydronephrosis, accounting for 62% of ureteral decompressive procedures. However, bilateral ureteroneocystostomy is a rare procedure, not exceeding 6% of ureteral reimplantations. This case illustrates a situation in which a patient with a previous bowel segmental resection presented with an advanced bilateral posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis, compromising the lower rectum below the previous anastomosis, vagina, posterior, and lateral parametrium bilaterally and both inferior hypogastric plexi. Hormonal therapy improved endometriosis symptoms but did not control the urinary tract involvement. Along with the patient, considering a high probability of intestinal, urinary, and sexual impairment, a conservative approach was chosen. INTERVENTION: The procedure started with adesiolysis, accessing the retroperitoneum and identifying both dilated ureters (Figs. 1 and 2). They were dissected as caudally as possible, until endometriosis fibrosis was reached, to have a bigger length of proximal ureter to allow a tension-free ureteroneocystostomy. The Retzius space was developed, and the bladder was freed and mobilized (Fig. 3). After cutting the ureter, the proximal end was spatulated. The bladder dome was approximated to the psoas muscle with an interrupted suture to permit a tension-free ureteroneocystostomy. The detrusor muscle was opened for approximately 2 to 3 cm, exposing the vesical mucosa, which was subsequently opened. The posterior ureterovesical anastomosis was performed with running monofilament absorbable 4-0 sutures. A double-J stent was placed, and the anterior ureterovesical anastomosis was completed. The detrusor muscle was loosely closed over the ureter with interrupted absorbable sutures to avoid urinary reflux. A Maryland clamp was used to ensure sufficient entry of the tunnel. All these steps were repeated in the contralateral side. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Successful performance of a bilateral laparoscopy tension-free ureteroneocystostomy with bilateral psoas hitch. RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful. Renal function was restored. One year after surgery, the patient remained asymptomatic, and endometriotic lesions showed no increase, thus remaining stable. CONCLUSION: Ureteral endometriosis can be aggressive and indolent. Decompressive procedures must be performed. The decision-making process must take into consideration the patient's characteristics and expectations. In selected cases, a conservative approach may be required, when future possible functional disfunctions can be worse than the actual symptoms. In those situations, close surveillance is necessary.",2021,115,1,256-258,10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.08.1427,#3875,FernandesLFC 2021,Bilateral ureteral endometriosis

The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationships between the expression of this enzymatic balance and the effects of NOS and arginase inhibition on bronchoconstrictive response to acetylcholine of patients without and with early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Twenty-two human bronchi [15 COPD (9 GOLD-0, 6 GOLD-1, -2-A), 7 nonsmokers] were investigated for immunohistochemistry and modulation of acetylcholine-induced airway constriction. Significantly increased expression of NOS2 in immunoblots of bronchial tissue and staining in smooth muscle cells was evidenced in patients with COPD compared with control subjects, whereas no modification of arginase expression was evidenced. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and NOS2 expression were negatively correlated (rho=-0.54, P=0.027). Pharmacological experiments demonstrated that resting tension was elevated in COPD compared with control subjects (2,243+/-154 vs. 1,574+/-218 mg, P=0.03) and was positively correlated with the expression of NOS2 (rho=0.61, P=0.044), whereas constrictor response to acetylcholine was similar [active tension, sensitivity (-logEC10), and reactivity (slope)]. The sole effect of the specific arginase inhibitor Nomega-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (1 microM) was to decrease sensitivity in COPD patients, whereas 1 mM NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester unexpectedly decreased resting tension because of a non-cGMP-dependent effect. In conclusion, an upregulation of NOS2 expression in COPD patients is involved in airway tone regulation and functional airflow limitation, whereas increased arginase activity is involved in airway sensitivity.",2008,294,3,L489-97,10.1152/ajplung.00109.2007,#3876,TadiÃ© 2008,
1192,12955165.0,Exercise and coronary vascular remodelling in the healthy heart.,Exp Physiol,"In this review the evidence for structural adaptations of the coronary circulation in the healthy adult heart in response to exercise and training is examined. Previously, it was thought that expansion of the coronary arteries and resistance vasculature occurred without angiogenesis. Detailed studies of the time course of coronary vascular remodelling now reveal that capillary proliferation is an integral response to exercise training, but is disguised by concurrent transformation of capillaries into arterioles by 'arteriolarization'. Increases in numbers of small arterioles < 30 micro m in diameter are accompanied by expansion in calibre of resistance and large coronary arteries. Stimuli related to increases in blood flow--shear stress and wall tension--and to mechanical deformation of the myocardium--stretch and compression--provide the main impetus for coronary vascular remodelling. Despite the technical difficulties of measuring such parameters in the heart in vivo, intervention studies using specific exercise components such as vasodilator, inotropic and chronotropic manipulations have allowed some insight into the differential regional effects of haemodynamic factors throughout the vascular tree. It remains to establish more clearly the involvement of mediators such as nitric oxide and growth factors in the temporal relationship to endothelial and smooth muscle growth and proliferation so that the endogenous attributes of exercise can be exploited for therapeutic purposes.",2003,88,5,645-58,10.1113/eph8802618,#3877,Brown 2003,
1193,30470812.0,New insights into mitral heart valve prolapse after chordae rupture through fluid-structure interaction computational modeling.,Sci Rep,"Mitral valve (MV) dynamics depends on a force balance across the mitral leaflets, the chordae tendineae, the mitral annulus, the papillary muscles and the adjacent ventricular wall. Chordae rupture disrupts the link between the MV and the left ventricle (LV), causing mitral regurgitation (MR), the most common valvular disease. In this study, a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling framework is implemented to investigate the impact of chordae rupture on the left heart (LH) dynamics and severity of MR. A control and seven chordae rupture LH models were developed to simulate a pathological process in which minimal chordae rupture precedes more extensive chordae rupture. Different non-eccentric and eccentric regurgitant jets were identified during systole. Cardiac efficiency was evaluated by the ratio of external stroke work. MV structural results showed that basal/strut chordae were the major load-bearing chordae. An increased number of ruptured chordae resulted in reduced basal/strut tension, but increased marginal/intermediate load. Chordae rupture in a specific scallop did not necessarily involve an increase in the stress of the entire prolapsed leaflet. This work represents a further step towards patient-specific modeling of pathological LH dynamics, and has the potential to improve our understanding of the biomechanical mechanisms and treatment of primary MR.",2018,8,1,17306,10.1038/s41598-018-35555-5,#3878,Caballero 2018,
1194,17446435.0,The troponin C G159D mutation blunts myofilament desensitization induced by troponin I Ser23/24 phosphorylation.,Circ Res,"Striated muscle contraction is regulated by the binding of Ca(2+) to the N-terminal regulatory lobe of the cardiac troponin C (cTnC) subunit in the troponin complex. In the heart, beta-adrenergic stimulation induces protein kinase A phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at Ser23/24 to alter the interaction of cTnI with cTnC in the troponin complex and is critical to the regulation of cardiac contractility. We investigated the effect of the dilated cardiomyopathy linked cTnC Gly159 to Asp (cTnC-G159D) mutation on the development of Ca(2+)-dependent tension and ATPase rate in whole troponin-exchanged skinned rat trabeculae. Even though this mutation is located in the C-terminal lobe of cTnC, the G159D mutation was demonstrated to depress ATPase activation and filament sliding in vitro. The effects of this mutation within the cardiac myofilament are unknown. Our results demonstrate that the cTnC-G159D mutation by itself does not alter the myofilament response to Ca(2+) in the cardiac muscle lattice. However, in the presence of cTnI phosphorylated at Ser23/24, which reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity and enhanced cross-bridge cycling in controls, cTnC-G159D specifically blunted the phosphorylation induced decrease in Ca(2+)-sensitive tension development without altering cross-bridge cycling. Measurements in purified troponin confirmed that this cTnC-G159D blunting of myofilament desensitization results from altered Ca(2+)-binding to cTnC. Our results provide novel evidence that modification of the cTnC-cTnI interaction has distinct effects on troponin Ca(2+)-binding and cross-bridge kinetics to suggest a novel role for thin filament mutations in the modulation of myofilament function through beta-adrenergic signaling as well as the development of cardiomyopathy.",2007,100,10,1486-93,10.1161/01.RES.0000267744.92677.7f,#3879,Biesiadecki 2007,

Clinical experience has indicated that fire-needle acupuncture treatment takes less time, requires fewer visits, and has more rapid results and fewer side effects compared to chemical medicine alternatives. This study will evaluate the effects of fire-needle acupuncture for ULSP in the context of standardized clinical research and provide high-quality data to inform clinical procedures and future study design. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial will be carried out to evaluate the effects of fire-needle acupuncture therapy in patients with ULSP from stroke. ULSP patients (n = 120) will be recruited at Changhai Hospital in Shanghai, China. Patients will be randomly divided into three groups, including fire-needle acupuncture group (FAG), filiform-needle acupuncture group (FFAG) and rehabilitation treatment group (RTG). During the 3-week treatment, the FAG will be treated every two days, while FFAG and RTG will be treated 5 d in a row and then rest for 2 d. The Simplified Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Scale and Modified Ashworth Scale will be used as the primary outcome measures. Statistical analysis will be conducted by an independent statistician. DISCUSSION: Through this study, the utility of fire-needle acupuncture in treating ULSP after stroke will be tested, and some specific claims of fire-needle acupuncture therapy will be evaluated, such as relieving spasm and muscular tension, improving activities of daily living, rapidity of response and less frequency of treatment compared with other treatments.

1197,18715870.0,Joint requirement for Rac and ERK activities underlies the mid-G1 phase induction of cyclin D1 and S phase entry in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells.,J Biol Chem,"Cyclin D1 gene induction is a key event in G1 phase progression. Our previous studies indicated that signaling to cyclin D1 is cell type-dependent because the timing of cyclin D1 gene expression in MCF10A mammary epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells is very different, with epithelial cells first expressing cyclin D1 in early rather than mid-G1 phase. In this report, we induced a mesenchymal phenotype in MCF10A cells by long-term exposure to TGF-beta and used the control and transitioned cells to examine cell type specificity of the signaling pathways that regulate cyclin D1 gene expression. We show that early-G1 phase cyclin D1 gene expression in MCF10A cells is under the control of Rac, whereas mid-G1 phase cyclin D1 induction requires parallel signaling from Rac and ERK, both in the control and transitioned cells. This combined requirement for Rac and ERK signaling is associated with an increased requirement for intracellular tension, Rb phosphorylation, and S phase entry. A similar co-regulation of cyclin D1 mRNA by Rac and ERK is seen in primary mesenchymal cells. Overall, our results reveal two mechanistically distinct phases of Rac-dependent cyclin D1 expression and emphasize that the acquisition of Rac/ERK co-dependence is required for the mid-G1 phase induction of cyclin D1 associated with S phase entry.",2008,283,45,30911-8,10.1074/jbc.M804537200,#3882,Klein 2008,

Purpose of this study was to help estimate these influences by measuring patients with scoliosis in three standardized postural positions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied the surface-topography measurement in 100 in-patients with idiopathic scoliosis divided into different age-groups. First group: 7 to 12 years (n=12), second group: 13 to 16 years (n=51), the third 17 to 20 years (n=15) and the fourth >21 years (n=22) (7 males and 93 females). The thoracic Cobb angle was 26.4 degrees, lumbar Cobb angle 25.7 degrees. We investigated the average lateral deviation (rms) and average surface rotation (rms). Measurements were taken one day before the patients left the clinic, after a 3 or 4 week in-patient intensive rehabilitation program (SIR), in three different postures:Normal posture: no specific instructions: standing with feet in an standardized way. Conscious posture: The patients acquired this posture during intensive daily exercising. Corrected posture: The most corrected posture the patients are able to achieve by using specific muscle tension and specific breathing techniques. We compared the results between the different postures. Then we calculated the results for the different age groups. RESULTS: There are significant differences in both parameters tested, some of them more than 40% to 67% greater than the measurement error calculated. The best results were achieved in the second and the third group with the conscious posture, the adult group had the best valued in most corrected posture. For the youngest patients there were no significant changes with the different postures. CONCLUSIONS: Surface measurements can be influenced by artificial postures and therefore cannot be attributed as objective. This is why the surface measurements should be made by someone independent from the treatment process in order to exclude any bias as far as possible. Surface topography may be used for postural monitoring in the rehabilitation process of patients with scoliosis.",2008,140,,140-3,,#3883,Schumann 2008,
1199,14691300.0,A novel in vitro model of trophoblast-mediated decidual blood vessel remodeling.,Lab Invest,"In vivo the extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) penetrate the decidua and the first third of the myometrium to remodel the uterine spiral arteries and achieve the high-flow, low-resistance circulation characteristic of the intervillous space of the term placenta. Much of our understanding of these processes comes from histologic analysis of placental bed biopsies, a limited tissue source and one that can provide only a snapshot of a dynamic process. To better characterize these cellular interactions, we have developed an in vitro co-culture system in which first trimester villous explants are cultured at low oxygen tension in contact with 2-mm(2) sections of decidua parietalis from the same patient. Hematoxylin eosin counterstaining of paraffin sections shows that EVT columns form at the tips of the placental villi and adhere and penetrate the decidual surface. The decidual blood vessels in the path of the EVT show morphologic disruption. Immunohistochemical analysis of the co-cultures using both an endothelial specific anti-CD31 and an anti-smooth muscle actin antibody show a disruption of the integrity of the vessel lining together with a complete loss of organized smooth muscle actin surrounding the blood vessels. In contrast control decidua samples in the absence of placental villi exhibit blood vessels with a complete endothelial lining and an organized muscular sheath. Using both an anti-cytokeratin-7 and anti-Cdx-2 antibody specific to trophoblasts, we show that these changes coincide with invasion of the vessels by endovascular trophoblasts and penetration of the decidua by interstitial EVTs. No EVTs were found in the control decidua. Thus we conclude that this in vitro model mimics the physiologic change observed in vivo during trophoblast invasion into maternal decidual tissues, and as such it may provide useful information concerning the interactions between EVTs and decidual cells and vessels during early gestation.",2003,83,12,1821-8,10.1097/01.lab.0000101730.69754.5a,#3884,Dunk 2003,

Concomitant with the increasing complexity of the operative intervention is the deterioration of periarticular soft-tissue envelope integrity, causing increased risk of dislocation. Risk factors can be categorized as impingement independent or impingement related. Impingement-independent risk factors include those related to compromised soft-tissue tension, patient-specific issues, and surgical approach. Impingement-related risk factors include head-to-neck size and geometry, acetabular liner geometry, and surgical technique. Indications for constraint include recurrent hip instability after arthroplasty, intraoperative multidirectional hip instability, neuromuscular diseases that impair hip dynamics, neurologic diseases that impair the patient's ability to restrict activities, and proximal muscle weakness with or without deficiency of the protective muscular.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of specific OMT modalities used by COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE candidates and to report frequent use on the basis of clinical presentation. METHODS: With enhanced scoring procedures in place, OMT physician-examiners identified and documented specific OMT techniques that were performed by candidates at the 28 colleges of osteopathic medicine and branch campuses that had eligible students at that time. A frequency analysis for OMT techniques, according to clinical content axis, was applied to all candidates (N=4757) for the 2010-2011 testing cycle. RESULTS: Students used a wide range of specific OMT techniques. Candidates performed 24,202 instances of specific OMT techniques, including 10,471 myofascial/soft tissue (43.3%), 3942 muscle energy (16.3%), 1676 sinus drainage (6.9%), 1476 inhibition (6.1%), 1221 fascial release (5.0%), 1171 rib raising (4.8%), 918 lymphatic (3.8%), and 866 counterstrain (3.6%). A few students (<0.01%) used high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA), a technique that is prohibited from use on the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE because of the potential hazard of repeatedly treating a standardized patient with thrust technique to the same segment in a given day. Additional techniques included functional, facilitated positional release, balanced ligamentous tension, and visceral. Use of techniques also varied according to the clinical presentation of the standardized patient (ie, cardiovascular, respiratory, neuromusculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, or other) and chronicity (ie, acute or chronic). CONCLUSION: Findings contributed to a better understanding of the types of OMT techniques being used by candidates taking COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE.

1202,15998339.0,Mechanical signals regulating extracellular matrix gene expression in fibroblasts.,Scand J Med Sci Sports,"Mechanical forces are essential for connective tissue homeostasis. The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in the transmission of forces generated by the organism (e.g. muscle contraction) and externally applied (e.g. gravity). The expression of specific ECM proteins such as collagens and tenascin-C, as well as of matrix metalloproteinases, involved in their turnover, is influenced by mechanical stimuli. The precise mechanisms by which mechanical strains are translated into chemical signals and lead to differential gene expression are however not fully understood. Cell-matrix adhesion sites are good candidates for hosting a ""mechanosensory switch"", as they transmit forces from the ECM to the cytoskeleton and vice versa by physically linking the cytoskeleton to the ECM. Integrins, transmembrane proteins located to these adhesion sites, have been shown to trigger a set of internal signaling cascades after mechanical stimulation. We have shown that the expression level of tenascin-C directly correlates with externally applied mechanical stress, as well as with RhoA/RhoA-dependent kinase-mediated cytoskeletal tension. Presumably other genes are regulated in a similar manner. The changes in ECM composition and mechanical properties derived from mechanical stress are relevant in medical intervention after ligament and tendon injury.",2005,15,4,223-30,10.1111/j.1600-0838.2005.00461.x,#3887,Sarasa-Renedo 2005,

Subunit 4 (COX4), a key regulatory subunit, exists as two isoforms, the ubiquitous isoform 1 and the tissue-specific (predominantly lung) isoform 2 (COX4I2). COX4I2 renders lung COX about 2-fold more active compared with liver COX, which lacks COX4I2. We previously identified a highly conserved 13-bp sequence in the proximal promoter of COX4I2 that functions as an oxygen responsive element (ORE), maximally active at a 4% oxygen concentration. Here, we have identified three transcription factors that bind this conserved ORE, namely recombination signal sequence-binding protein Jκ (RBPJ), coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain 2 (CHCHD2) and CXXC finger protein 5 (CXXC5). We demonstrate that RBPJ and CHCHD2 function towards activating the ORE at 4% oxygen, whereas CXXC5 functions as an inhibitor. To validate results derived from cultured cells, we show using RNA interference a similar effect of these transcription factors in the gene regulation of COX4I2 in primary pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Depending on the oxygen tension, a concerted action of the three transcription factors regulates the expression of COX4I2 that, as we discuss, could augment both COX activity and its ability to cope with altered cellular energy requirements.",2013,41,4,2255-66,10.1093/nar/gks1454,#3888,Aras 2013,
1204,31377863.0,Whiplash-Associated Dysphagia: Considerations of Potential Incidence and Mechanisms.,Dysphagia,"Non-specific self-reports of dysphagia have been described in people with whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) following motor vehicle collision (MVC); however, incidence and mechanistic drivers remain poorly understood. Alterations in oropharyngeal dimensions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), along with heightened levels of stress, pain, and changes in stress-dependent microRNA expression (e.g., miR-320a) have been also associated with WAD, suggesting multi-factorial issues may underpin any potential swallowing changes. In this exploratory paper, we examine key biopsychosocial parameters in three patients with persistent WAD reporting swallowing change and three nominating full recovery after whiplash with no reported swallowing change. Parameters included (1) oropharyngeal volume with 3D MRI, (2) peritraumatic miR-320a expression, and (3) psychological distress. These factors were explored to highlight the complexity of patient presentation and propose future considerations in relation to a potential deglutition disorder following WAD. The three participants reporting changes in swallowing all had smaller oropharyngeal volumes at < 1 week and at 3 months post injury and lower levels of peritraumatic miR-320a. At 3 months post MVC, oropharyngeal volumes between groups indicated a large effect size (Hedge's g = 0.96). Higher levels of distress were reported at both time points for those with persistent symptomatology, including self-reported dysphagia, however, this was not featured in those nominating recovery. This paper considers current evidence for dysphagia as a potentially under-recognized feature of WAD and highlights the need for future, larger-scaled, multidimensional investigation into the incidence and mechanisms of whiplash-associated dysphagia.",2020,35,3,403-413,10.1007/s00455-019-10039-4,#3889,Stone 2020,Deglutition

This article draws on an ongoing ethnographic, netnographic and cross-cultural investigation of the transmission of knowledge in this atypical association that combines Taijiquan with a range of practices such as Qigong, body loosening exercises and meditation. Exploring the ideal body cultivated by the students, we describe and illustrate key (and often overlooked) body areas-namely the spine, scapula, Kua and feet, which are continually worked on in the School of Internal Arts' exercise-based pedagogy. We argue that Neigong and Taijiquan, rather than being forms of physical education, are vehicles for adult physical re-education. This re-education offers space in which mind-body tension built over the life course are systematically released through specific forms of attentive, meditative exercise to lay the foundations for a strong, powerful body for martial artistry and health.",2021,18,9,,10.3390/ijerph18094417,#3890,Ma 2021,mind-body
1206,35959703.0,"From protection to non-protection: A mixed methods study investigating movement, posture and recovery from disabling low back pain.",Eur J Pain,"BACKGROUND: Movement and posture are commonly believed to relate to low back pain (LBP). Yet, we know little about how people make sense of the relationship between their LBP, movement and posture, particularly after recovery. We aimed to qualitatively explore this understanding, how it changes and how it relates to quantitative changes. METHODS: A mixed method study in the context of an existing single-case design involving 12 people with disabling non-specific LBP. Interviews were conducted before and after a 12-week physiotherapy-led Cognitive Functional Therapy intervention, and qualitative findings from these were integrated with individualized, quantitative measures of movement, posture, psychological factors, pain and activity limitation. RESULTS: Strong beliefs about movement and posture were identified during the baseline interviews. Lived experiences of tension and stiffness characterized the embodiment of 'nonconscious protection', while healthcare and societal messages prompted pain-related fear and 'conscious protection'. Through varied journeys, most participants reported improvements over time with less protective movement and postural strategies. For some, being less protective required focused attention ('conscious non-protection'), but most returned to automatic, normal and fearless patterns ('nonconscious non-protection'), forgetting about their LBP. One participant reported no meaningful shift, remaining protective. Greater spinal range, faster movement, more relaxed postures and less back muscle EMG accompanied positive changes in self-report factors. CONCLUSION: The findings offer a framework for understanding how people make sense of movement and posture during the process of recovery from persistent, disabling non-specific LBP. This involved a re-conceptualisation of movement and posture, from threatening, to therapeutic. SIGNIFICANCE: Findings from qualitative interviews before and after a Cognitive Functional Therapy intervention in 12 people with disabling low back pain highlighted an individualized recovery journey from conscious and nonconscious protection to conscious non-protection for some, and nonconscious non-protection for many. Pre and post-quantitative measures of movement, posture, psychological factors, pain and activity limitation integrated well with the qualitative findings. The findings suggest movement and posture may form part of a multidimensional pain schema.",2022,26,10,2097-2119,10.1002/ejp.2022,#3891,Wernli 2022,
1207,15483767.0,[Clinical significance of stress reactivity for frequency of electric shock discharges in patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators].,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Recent research indicates that discharges of implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) are triggered by psychosocial stress. This study examined the presence of patterns of psychophysiological stress reactivity in ICD-patients. Further more potential relationship between factors of stress reactivity and the frequency of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators discharges was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 46 consecutive patients (38 male, 8 female; age: 26-80 years) with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators the following parameters of physiological reactivity were measured in a standardised experimental stress test: Heart rate, skin conductance, muscle tension and respiratory activity. In a standardised interview anxiety sensitivity, depression, desire for control, stress load, and attitude towards the defibrillator were evaluated and quantified. The relationship between the mentioned parameters were examined with factor analysis to reveal patterns of psychophysiological reactivity. Potential relationship between psychophysiological factors and frequency of shock delivery was verified with linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed four independent psychophysiological traits. The factors were named ""Play Dead Reflex"", ""Heart Phobia"", ""Negativism"" and ""Irritability"". Linear regression model showed significant correlation between ""Play Dead Reflex"" and discharge frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the presence of specific psychophysiological stress reaction patterns in ICD-patients. The stress reaction pattern ""Play Dead Reflex"" could be discussed as a potential risk factor in developing life-threatening tachyarrhythmias leading to an increase in defibrillator discharges in patients with ICD.

Inpatients (n=29) with a diagnosis of moderate to severe depression (ICD-10) and 29 matched healthy controls were included in the study. Bodily symptoms were assessed with the Body Awareness Scale (BAS) and the severity of depression with the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS). Patients were assessed twice, i.e. when admitted to hospital and again when discharged. The patients with severe depression had more muscular tension, pain-complaints, restricted breathing, negative attitudes towards own body and lesser centring in movements compared with the healthy controls (p<0.001). Improvement in bodily symptoms was statistically significant (p<0.01), and an improvement in depression score was observed. The findings of the study may underline the importance of investigating bodily symptoms in depression and indicates a need for a specific physiotherapeutic treatment of patients with moderate to severe depression.",2006,60,4,294-8,10.1080/08039480600790358,#3893,NyboeJacobsen 2006,

This work aimed to validate the biomechanical benefit of the structural optimized PSMRPs relative to the original design and compare the biomechanical performance between PSMRP1 with generic contour customization and PSMRP2 with a tangent arc upper margin in mandibular angle region. METHODS: Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate the biomechanical behavior of mandibular reconstruction assemblies (MRAs) concerning these two structural optimized PSMRPs by simulating momentary left group clenching and incisal clenching tasks. Bonded contact was set between mandibular bone and fixation screws and between PSMRP and fixation screws in the MRA, while the frictionless connection was allocated between mandibular bone and PSMRP. The loads were applied on four principal muscles, including masseter, temporalis, lateral and medial pterygoid, whose magnitudes along the three orthogonal directions. The mandibular condyles were retrained in all three directions, and either the left molars or incisors area were restrained from moving vertically. RESULTS: The peak von Mises stresses of structural optimized PSMRPs (264 MPa, 296 MPa) were way lower than that of the initial PSMRP design (393 MPa), with 33 and 25% reduction during left group clenching. The peak magnitude of von Mises stress, minimum principal stress, and maximum principal strain of PSMRP1 (264 MPa, 254 MPa; -297 MPa, -285 MPa; 0.0020, 0.0020) was lower than that of PSMRP2 (296 MPa, 286 MPa; -319 MPa, -306 MPa; 0.0022, 0.0020), while the peak maximum principal stress of PSMRP1 (275 MPa, 257 MPa) was higher than that of PSMRP2 (254 MPa, 235 MPa) during both left group clenching and incisal clenching tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The structural optimized PSMRPs reveal their biomechanical advantage compared with the original design. The PSMRP1 presents better biomechanical performance to the patient-specific mandibular reconstruction than PSMRP2 as a result of its superior safety, preferable flexibility, and comparable stability. The PSMRP2 provides biomechanical benefit in reducing the maximum tension than PSMRP1, indicated by lower peak maximum principal stress, through tangent arc upper margin in mandibular angle region.",2022,224,,107023,10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.107023,#3894,Zhong 2022,Additive manufacturing

In panic disorder, the predominant view has been that central noradrenergic neuronal networks and/or the sympathetic nervous system was normal in patients at rest, but hyper-reactive to specific stimuli, for example carbon dioxide. These ideas have been extended to other anxiety disorders, which share with panic disorder characteristic subjective anxiety and physiological symptoms of excess sympathetic activity. For example, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is characterized by chronic free-floating anxiety, muscle tension, palpitation and insomnia. It has been proposed that there is chronic central hypersecretion of noradrenaline in Generalized Anxiety Disorder, with consequent hyporesponsiveness of central post-synaptic receptors. With regards to other disorders, it has been suggested that there is noradrenergic involvement or derangement, but a more specific hypothesis has not been enunciated.

1211,20048478.0,"The H-Wave((R)) Device Induces NODependent Augmented Microcirculation and Angiogenesis, Providing Both Analgesia and Tissue Healing in Sports Injuries.",Phys Sportsmed,"The hypothesis that the H-Wave(R) device (Electronic Waveform Lab, Inc., Huntington Beach, CA), a small-diameter fiber stimulator, is a paradigm shift of electrotherapeutic treatment of pain associated with human neuropathies and sports injuries is based on a number of its properties. The primary effect of H-Wave(R) device stimulation (HWDS) is the stimulation of ""red-slow-twitch"" skeletal muscle fibers. The authors propose, based on the unique waveform, that the H-Wave(R) device specifically and directly stimulates the small smooth muscle fibers within the lymphatic vessels ultimately leading to fluid shifts and reduced edema. In unpublished rat studies, it has been observed that HWDS induces protein clearance. The H-Wave(R) device was designed to stimulate an ultra low frequency (1-2 Hz), low tension, nontetanizing, and nonfatiguing contraction, which closely mimics voluntary or natural muscle contractions. The H-Wave(R) device can stimulate small fibers due in part to its exponentially decaying waveform and constant current generator activity. The main advantage of these technologies over currently applied electrical stimulators (eg, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator [TENS], interferential [IF], neuromuscular electrical stimulation [NMES], high-volt galvanic, etc.) is that H-Wave\'s(R) small fiber contraction does not trigger an activation of the motor nerves of the large white muscle fibers or the sensory delta and C pain nerve fibers, thus eliminating the negative and painful effects of tetanizing fatigue, which reduces transcapillary fluid shifts. Another function of the H-Wave(R) device is an anesthetic effect on pain conditions, unlike a TENS unit which in the short term activates a hypersensory overload effect (gate theory) to stop pain signals from reaching the thalamic region of the brain. When the H-Wave(R) device is used at high frequency (60 Hz), it acts intrinsically on the nerve to deactivate the sodium pump within the nerve fiber, leading to a long-lasting anesthetic/analgesic effect due to an accumulative postsynaptic depression. Moreover, HWDS produces a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent enhancement of microcirculation and angiogenesis in rats. Thus, the authors hypothesize that because of these innate properties of the H-Wave(R) device, it may provide a paradigm shift for the treatment of both short- and long-term inflammatory conditions associated with pain due to sports injuries. A recent meta-analysis found a moderate-to-strong effect of the H-Wave(R) device in providing pain relief, reducing the requirement for pain medication, and increasing functionality. The most robust effect was observed for improved functionality, suggesting that the H-Wave(R) device may facilitate a quicker return to the field.

Several pathogenic mechanisms have been hypothesized, without conclusive results. In this study, we evaluated the most frequent neurological symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and also investigated the possible relationship between plasmatic inflammatory indices and olfactory disorders (ODs) and between muscle pain and creatine kinase (CK). METHODS: We consecutively enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients. A structured questionnaire concerning typical and neurological symptoms, focusing on headache, dizziness, ODs, taste disorders (TDs), and muscle pain, was administrated by telephone interviews. RESULTS: Common neurological symptoms were reported in the early phase of the disease, with a median onset ranging from 1 to 3 days. Headache showed tension-type features and was more frequently associated with a history of headache. Patients with ODs less frequently needed oxygen therapy. Inflammatory indices did not significantly differ between patients with and without ODs. Muscle pain did not show any association with CK level but was more frequently associated with arthralgia and headache. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, ODs were an early symptom of COVID-19, more frequently reported by patients with milder forms of disease. Headache in association with arthralgia and muscle pain seems to reflect the common symptoms of the flu-like syndrome, and not COVID-19 infection-specific.",2020,41,8,2029-2031,10.1007/s10072-020-04525-z,#3897,Vacchiano 2020,COVID-19
1213,20840535.0,Expression and function of the K+ channel KCNQ genes in human arteries.,Br J Pharmacol,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: KCNQ-encoded voltage-gated potassium channels (K(v) 7) have recently been identified as important anti-constrictor elements in rodent blood vessels but the role of these channels and the effects of their modulation in human arteries remain unknown. Here, we have assessed KCNQ gene expression and function in human arteries ex vivo. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Fifty arteries (41 from visceral adipose tissue, 9 mesenteric arteries) were obtained from subjects undergoing elective surgery. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments using primers specific for all known KCNQ genes and immunohistochemsitry were used to show K(v) 7 channel expression. Wire myography and single cell electrophysiology assessed the function of these channels. KEY RESULTS: KCNQ4 was expressed in all arteries assessed, with variable contributions from KCNQ1, 3 and 5. KCNQ2 was not detected. K(v) 7 channel isoform-dependent staining was revealed in the smooth muscle layer. In functional studies, the K(v) 7 channel blockers, XE991 and linopirdine increased isometric tension and inhibited K(+) currents. In contrast, the K(v) 7.1-specific blocker chromanol 293B did not affect vascular tone. Two K(v) 7 channel activators, retigabine and acrylamide S-1, relaxed preconstricted arteries, actions reversed by XE991. K(v) 7 channel activators also suppressed spontaneous contractile activity in seven arteries, reversible by XE991. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate not only the presence of KCNQ gene products in human arteries but also their contribution to vascular tone ex vivo.

1214,19032510.0,Item selection and content validity of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool for non-verbal adults.,J Adv Nurs,"AIM: This paper is a report of the item selection process and evaluation of the content validity of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool for non-verbal critically ill adults. BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients experience moderate to severe pain in the intensive care unit. While critical care clinicians strive to obtain the patient's self-report of pain, many factors compromise the patient's ability to communicate verbally. Pain assessment methods often need to match the communication capabilities of the patient. In non-verbal patients, observable behavioural and physiological indicators become important indices for pain assessment. METHOD: A mixed method study design was used for the development of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool in 2002-2003. More specifically, a four-step process was undertaken: (1) literature review, (2) review of 52 patients' medical files, (3) focus groups with 48 critical care nurses, and interviews with 12 physicians, and (4) evaluation of content validity with 17 clinicians using a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Item selection was derived from different sources of information which were convergent and complementary in their content. An initial version of the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool was developed including both behavioural and physiological indicators. Because physiological indicators received more criticism than support, only the four behaviours with content validity indices >0.80 were included in the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool: facial expression, body movements, muscle tension and compliance with the ventilator. CONCLUSION: Item selection and expert opinions are relevant aspects of tool development. While further evaluation is planned, the Critical-Care Pain Observation Tool appears as a useful instrument to assess pain in critically ill patients.",2009,65,1,203-16,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04847.x,#3899,GÃ©linas 2009,
1215,8971661.0,Psychological and physical factors involved in chronic idiopathic prostatitis.,J Psychosom Res,"Idiopathic prostatitis is a common, often chronic condition in which psychological factors are suspected to play a role. Men with chronic prostatitis (n = 51) and a control group of 34 men without any chronic pain condition, equivalent on demographic characteristics, were compared on psychological and perineal muscle tension measures. Prostate-specific antigen and expressed prostatic secretion cell counts were also measured. Chronic prostatitis patients were consistently more elevated than controls on hypochondriasis, depression, and hysteria (MMPI), and on somaticization and depression (Brief Symptom Inventory), and were less elevated on masculine/instrumentality (Personal Attributes Questionnaire) scales. A cluster analysis of MMPI profiles revealed that 57% of the chronic prostatitis patients produced generally unelevated MMPI profiles, whereas the remaining 43% fell into two groups with distinct patterns of distress. The results indicate depression and psychosocial distress are common among chronic prostatitis patients, calling for careful evaluation and attention to psychological symptoms.",1996,41,4,313-25,10.1016/s0022-3999(96)00157-2,#3900,Berghuis 1996,
1216,34719570.0,[A new therapeutic target for patent ductus arteriosus].,Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi,"The ductus arteriosus (DA) maintains the fetal circulation by connecting the aorta and pulmonary arteries. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs in >70% extremely-low-birth-weight infants. Patients with PDA exhibit circulatory failure, which is caused by left-to-right shunt. The DA immediately contracts after birth in response to the elevation of blood oxygen tension and to the decline in circulating prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). Cyclooxygenase inhibitors targeting smooth muscle cell (SMC) contraction represent only pharmacological treatment for PDA. However, it is important for DA anatomical closure that intimal thickening (IT) is appropriately formed between SMC layer and endothelial cells (EC). IT begins to form before the second-trimester and becomes prominent toward the end of third-trimester as an increase in placenta-derived PGE(2). Immature DAs frequently fail to be close due to poorly formed IT. IT consists of extracellular matrices (ECM) and migrated DA-SMCs from the tunica media. A glycoprotein fibulin-1 is expressed in developing cardiovascular system and binds to multiple ECMs. We found that PGE(2) increased fibulin-1 via EP4 in DA-SMCs, and Fbln1-deficient mice exhibited PDA with poor IT formation. Although EP4 is a Gs-coupled GPCR, fibulin-1 was secreted from DA-SMCs through the phospholipase C-protein kinase C-non-canonical NFκB signaling pathway. Fibulin-1 bound to DA-EC-derived versican which is a binding partner of hyaluronan, which promoted directional DA-SMC migration toward ECs and contributed to IT formation in the DA. Fibulin-1 upregulation by the activation of specific downstream pathway of EP4 may serve a new pharmacological strategy for PDA.",2021,156,6,359-363,10.1254/fpj.21061,#3901,Ito 2021,
1217,18725429.0,"Trait anger management style moderates effects of actual (""state"") anger regulation on symptom-specific reactivity and recovery among chronic low back pain patients.",Psychosom Med,"OBJECTIVES: We examined whether ""state"" anger regulation-inhibition or expression-among chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients would affect lower paraspinal (LP) muscle tension following anger-induction, and whether these effects were moderated by trait anger management style. METHOD: Eighty-four CLBP patients underwent harassment, then they regulated anger under one of two conditions: half expressed anger by telling stories about people depicted in pictures, whereas half inhibited anger by only describing objects appearing in the same pictures. They completed the anger-out and anger-in subscales (AOS; AIS) of the anger expression inventory. RESULTS: General Linear Model procedures were used to test anger regulation condition by AOS/AIS by period interactions for physiological indexes. Significant three-way interactions were found such that: a) high trait anger-out patients in the inhibition condition appeared to show the greatest LP reactivity during the inhibition period followed by the slowest recovery; b) high trait anger-out patients in the expression condition appeared to show the greatest systolic blood pressure (SBP) reactivity during the expression period followed by rapid recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Results implicate LP muscle tension as a potential physiological mechanism that links the actual inhibition of anger following provocation to chronic pain severity among CLBP patients. Results also highlight the importance of mismatch situations for patients who typically regulate anger by expressing it. These CLBP patients may be at particular risk for elevated pain severity if circumstances at work or home regularly dictate that they should inhibit anger expression.",2008,70,8,898-905,10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181835cb7,#3902,Burns 2008,
1218,28194441.0,Deletion of neuropilin 2 enhances detrusor contractility following bladder outlet obstruction.,JCI Insight,"Chronic urethral obstruction and the ensuing bladder wall remodeling can lead to diminished bladder smooth muscle (BSM) contractility and debilitating lower urinary tract symptoms. No effective pharmacotherapy exists to restore BSM contractile function. Neuropilin 2 (Nrp2) is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in BSM. Nrp2 deletion in mice leads to increased BSM contraction. We determined whether genetic ablation of Nrp2 could restore BSM contractility following obstruction. Partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO) was created by urethral occlusion in mice with either constitutive and ubiquitous, or inducible smooth muscle-specific deletion of Nrp2, and Nrp2-intact littermates. Mice without obstruction served as additional controls. Contractility was measured by isometric tension testing. Nrp2 deletion prior to pBOO increased force generation in BSM 4 weeks following surgery. Deletion of Nrp2 in mice already subjected to pBOO for 4 weeks showed increased contractility of tissues tested 6 weeks after surgery compared with nondeleted controls. Assessment of tissues from patients with urodynamically defined bladder outlet obstruction revealed reduced NRP2 levels in obstructed bladders with compensated compared with decompensated function, relative to asymptomatic controls. We conclude that downregulation of Nrp2 promotes BSM force generation. Neuropilin 2 may represent a novel target to restore contractility following obstruction.",2017,2,3,e90617,10.1172/jci.insight.90617,#3903,Vasquez 2017,

1221,8666102.0,Lung function measurement in awake young children.,Eur Respir J,"The aim of the study was to evaluate methods applicable in a clinical setting for monitoring of changes in lung function in awake young children. Impedance measurements by the impulse oscillation technique (ZIOS), respiratory resistance measurements by the interrupter technique (Rint) and transcutaneous measurements of oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) were compared with concomitant measurements of specific airway resistance (sRaw) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by whole body plethysmography and spirometry, respectively, during methacholine challenge in 21 young children aged 4-6 yrs, with suspected asthma. Measurements with each technique were repeated after each challenge step. A special face-mask was developed with an integrated mouthpiece which ensured mouth breathing during the measurements. The order of sensitivity of the techniques to assess methacholine-induced changes in lung function was ZIOS > sRaw > Ptc,O2 > FEV1 > Rint. ZIOS was significantly more sensitive than all subsequent methods, and Ptc,O2 was significantly more sensitive than FEV1. ZIOS, sRaw and Rint, but not Ptc,O2 and FEV1, detected the subclinical increase in bronchial muscle tone in the children during baseline, which was revealed by the significantly reduced airway obstruction after inhalation of a beta 2-agonist as compared to baseline. It is concluded that ZIOS, Rint and Ptc,O2 change in parallel with sRaw and FEV1 and with a comparable sensitivity during simultanoeous measurements of the response to methacholine in young children aged 4-6 yrs. This implies that ZIOS, Rint and Ptc,O2 provide convenient indices of changes in lung function. Their combined use will be useful for monitoring airway diseases of young children.",1995,8,12,2067-75,10.1183/09031936.95.08122067,#3906,Bisgaard 1995,

This retrospective study aimed to explore the optimal acupuncture intervention time for long-term efficacy on motor dysfunction in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke through 1-year of follow-up. Three hundred and nine patients collected at Longhua Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017 were classified into 3 groups based on the acupuncture intervention time, including groups A (within 2 days), B (within 3-7 days) and C (within 8-14 days). All patients had received standard treatment combined with acupuncture therapy. Specifically, acupuncture was performed at the acupoints including LI4 (Hegu), ST40 (Fenglong), DU20 (Baihui), and motor area of the scalp, followed by 2 electroacupuncture protocols based on different muscle tensions once a day for 5 days consecutively. The time-effect relationship was assessed using both the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and the modified Barthel index (MBI) on the 90th day and 1st year, respectively. Meanwhile, the modified Rankin scale (mRS), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and fibrinogen (FIB) were also measured during the 1-year follow-up. The favorable outcome rate was 74.4%. One-way univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in FMA and MBI on the 90th day among the 3 groups ([Formula: see text] < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in FMA, MBI or mRS at the 1st year between groups A and B. The levels of hs-CRP and FIB ([Formula: see text] < 0.05) were markedly reduced. Binary logistic regression analysis suggested that patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (odds ratio (OR): 3.156), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR: 2.563), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR: 2.174) or stroke history (OR: 1.883) were more inclined to recover poorly from nerve function deficit ([Formula: see text] < 0.05).

Retrospective data were derived from self-report questionnaires assessing recent stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10), anxiety, and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) in a cohort of new patients presenting to a voice clinic. Data are presented on 160 patients with muscle tension dysphonia (MTD), benign vocal fold lesions, paradoxical vocal fold movement disorder (PVFMD), or glottal insufficiency. Pooled data indicated that average stress, anxiety, and depression scores were similar to those found for the healthy population. However, 25.0%, 36.9%, and 31.2% of patients showed elevated stress, anxiety, and depression scores, respectively, compared to norms. Patients with PVFMD had the most frequent occurrence-and patients with glottal insufficiency had the least frequent occurrence of elevated stress, anxiety, and depression. Stress and depression were more common with MTD than with lesions, whereas reverse results were obtained for anxiety. More females than males had elevated stress, anxiety, and depression scores. The data are consistent with suggestions that stress, anxiety, and depression may be common among some patients with PVFMD, MTD, and vocal fold lesions and more common for women than men. However, individual variability in the data set was large.

1224,375296.0,"Prostaglandins, their intermediates and precursors: cardiovascular actions and regulatory roles in normal and abnormal circulatory systems.",Prog Cardiovasc Dis,"The characterization of newly found unstable metabolites of arachidonic acid has provided new perspectives for cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms and new insights into disorders of the circulatory system. Since these intermediates are often more potent on and more specific for cardiovascular structures than the classical prostaglandins, they are more likely candidates as physiologic mediators of circulatory events. Their instability in vitro need not preclude these roles; on the contrary, the limited pharmacology described to date suggests that they function purely as local hormones. As such, changes in the rate of generation of these unstable but potent compounds would provide an excellent control system. The stable prostaglandins may represent only overflow of degradation products of the active mediators associated with pathologic events. For example, the dicovery of prostacyclin and the realization that this prostaglandin and not PGE2 is the primary metabolite of arachidonic acid in blood vessels emphasizes the need to reinterpret many of the previously held hypotheses that proposed that prostaglandins of the E series contributed to the regulation of vessel tone and blood pressure, Moreover, the contribution made by abnormal prostaglandin mechanisms to hypertensive disease should now take into account that a deficiency of prostacyclin and not PGE2 could be a major factor causing the elevated tension developed in vascular smooth muscle and the augmented vessel responsiveness to stimuli associated with hypertension.",1979,21,6,405-30,10.1016/0033-0620(79)90024-0,#3909,Dusting 1979,
1225,35174322.0,Ageing contributes to phenotype transition in a mouse model of periodic paralysis.,JCSM Rapid Commun,"BACKGROUND: Periodic paralysis (PP) is a rare genetic disorder in which ion channel mutation causes episodic paralysis in association with hyper- or hypokalaemia. An unexplained but consistent feature of PP is that a phenotype transition occurs around the age of 40, in which the severity of potassium-induced muscle weakness declines but onset of fixed, progressive weakness is reported. This phenotype transition coincides with the age at which muscle mass and optimal motor function start to decline in healthy individuals. We sought to determine if the phenotype transition in PP is linked to the normal ageing phenotype transition and to explore the mechanisms involved. METHODS: A mouse model of hyperkalaemic PP was compared with wild-type littermates across a range of ages (13-104 weeks). Only male mice were used as penetrance is incomplete in females. We adapted the muscle velocity recovery cycle technique from humans to examine murine muscle excitability in vivo. We then examined changes in potassium-induced weakness or caffeine contracture force with age using ex vivo muscle tension testing. Muscles were further characterized by either Western blot, histology or energy charge measurement. For normally distributed data, a student's t-test (± Welch correction) or one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine significance. For data that were not normally distributed, Welch rank test, Mann Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was performed. When an ANOVA was significant (P < 0.05), post hoc Tukey testing was used. RESULTS: Both WT (P = 0.009) and PP (P = 0.007) muscles exhibit increased resistance to potassium-induced weakness with age. Our data suggest that healthy-old muscle develops mechanisms to maintain force despite sarcolemmal depolarization and sodium channel inactivation. In contrast, reduced caffeine contracture force (P = 0.00005), skeletal muscle energy charge (P = 0.004) and structural core pathology (P = 0.005) were specific to Draggen muscle, indicating that they are caused, or at least accelerated by, chronic genetic ion channel dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The phenotype transition with age is replicated in a mouse model of PP. Intrinsic muscle ageing protects against potassium-induced weakness in HyperPP mice. However, it also appears to accelerate impairment of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, mitochondrial impairment and the development of core-like regions, suggesting acquired RyR1 dysfunction as the potential aetiology. This work provides a first description of mechanisms involved in phenotype transition with age in PP. It also demonstrates how studying phenotype transition with age in monogenic disease can yield novel insights into both disease physiology and the ageing process itself.",2021,4,2,245-259,10.1002/rco2.41,#3910,Suetterlin 2021,Ageing; Channelopathy; Periodic paralysis; Sarcopenia; Skeletal muscle; Ion channels
1226,24024603.0,OnabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of headache.,Headache,"Botulinum toxin, a potent muscle relaxant, has been found to have analgesic effects in patients with various pain syndromes. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed the ability of the toxin to block the release of pain neurotransmitters, such as substance P, glutamate, and calcitonin gene-related peptide. The effect of the toxin, and specifically of one of its serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin type A, on headaches, has been extensively studied. This serotype is available in the United States in 3 forms, including as onabotulinumtoxinA. Data from clinical trials confirmed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of onabotulinumtoxinA in the prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine, the most severe and debilitating type of migraine, in adults. The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this indication in 2010. The drug was not found to be effective for episodic migraine or tension-type headache. Noncontrolled studies suggest the efficacy of the toxin for headache associated with craniocervical dystonia. Proper injection technique and appropriate patient selection are essential for achieving positive results after treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA. The recommended injection paradigm combines a fixed site/fixed dose and follow the pain approaches, with the toxin injected to multiple sites of the head and neck, at a total dose of 155U-195U. The treatment is given at intervals of 12 weeks on average. The efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA for some headaches, its long duration of action, and its favorable adverse effect profile make it a viable treatment option for the appropriate headache patients. The drug may be particularly suitable for patients who cannot tolerate, or are not compliant with, the daily intake of oral headache preventive drugs.",2013,53 Suppl 2,,54-61,10.1111/head.12185,#3911,Ashkenazi 2013,chronic migraine

Plasma concentrations of these agents were measured for 6 h following administration, using a sensitive and specific capillary gas chromatographic assay. Concentration v. time data were analysed by non-linear regression and fitted to a two- or three-compartment model as appropriate. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed by measuring the mechanical evoked response of the adductor pollicis muscle to train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Pipecuronium had a larger steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) (309 (SD 103) ml kg-1) and greater plasma clearance (Cl) (2.4 (0.6) ml kg-1 min-1) than pancuronium (199 (54) ml kg-1 and 1.5 (0.4) ml kg-1 min-1, respectively). The volumes of the central compartment, distribution and elimination half-lives and mean residence times were similar for both agents and within the range expected for drugs of this type. The durations of action (injection to 25% recovery of twitch tension) of pipecuronium and pancuronium were similar: 98.0 (36.1) min and 117.2 (35.8) min, respectively.

The recent Quebec Classification of Whiplash Associated Disorders (WAD) contributed to define nosographically all the clinical manifestations usually grouped under the terms acute/post-traumatic and late ""syndrome"". In the late phase of WAD, neck pain and neck muscle contraction have been reported in all cases, together with headache in over 50%. ""Headache stemming from the neck"", despite numerous attempts to classify this entity (i.e. cervicogenic headache) according to the IASP classification (headache associated with neck disorders), is still a subject of debate. An adequate multiparametric procedure is required to study WAD, which takes into account: the patient's principal details; an exact reconstruction of the event; description and analysis of the signs and symptoms, with various complications and correlated dysfunctions; an objective neurological and neck-shoulder examination; and a battery of complementary instrumental tests which are described in this study. These investigations include evaluation of muscle tension (manual palpation, algometry, EMG recording), kinematic analysis of the cervical spine, neuropsychological and psychological evaluation, and evaluation of disability. In order to assess cervical spine mobility in WAD patients, a 3D kinematic analysis by means of the ELITE system and clinical evaluation were performed in our setting. Seventy patients with whiplash injury and 46 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Patients were tested at the time of first consultation and again 6 months and 12 months later. Clinical evaluation of the range of motion was performed both in patients and in 41 healthy volunteers.

Retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells that expressed high levels of E-cadherin and had cell-cell junctions rich in zona occludens (ZO)-1, β-catenin and heparan sulfate, required syndecan-4 but not fibronectin or protein kinase C α (PKCα) to assemble extracellular matrix (fibrillin microfibrils and perlecan). In contrast, RPE cells that strongly expressed mesenchymal smooth muscle α-actin but little ZO-1 or E-cadherin, required fibronectin (like fibroblasts) and PKCα, but not syndecan-4. Integrins α5β1 and/or α8β1 and actomyosin tension were common requirements for microfibril deposition, as was heparan sulfate biosynthesis. TGFβ, which stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, altered gene expression and overcame the dependency on syndecan-4 for microfibril deposition in epithelial RPE cells, whereas blocking cadherin interactions disrupted microfibril deposition. Renal podocytes had a transitional phenotype with pericellular β-catenin but little ZO-1; they required syndecan-4 and fibronectin for efficient microfibril deposition.

1230,27445000.0,[Biomechanics of distal radius fractures : Basics principles and GPS treatment strategy for locking plate osteosynthesis].,Unfallchirurg,"Fractures of the distal radius are most commonly caused by hyperextension injuries of the wrist. Tensile forces and force vectors, strength of impact, bone strength and soft tissue tension create individually different fracture patterns. Metaphyseal comminution, loss of cortical support, ligament avulsion and shear fragments are defining parameters for fracture instability. The dislocation of the articular fragment follows the force vectors of the extrinsic forearm muscles bridging the joint. The goal-plan-standardized (GPS) treatment strategy has proven to be helpful in choosing the ideal individual treatment. It is based on individual patient demands on wrist function and an analysis of fracture instability in computed tomography (CT) scans. The ""goal"" is a realistic expectation assessed by patient and surgeon. The ""plan"" includes a benefit-risk analysis and selection of an appropriate treatment modality. The ""standardized treatment"" of surgical and follow-up treatment is based on biomechanical knowledge. Locking plate osteosynthesis aims to neutralize dislocating force vectors and to allow early active mobility. Unidirectional instability can be indirectly neutralized by palmar locking plate systems.

1231,29699103.0,Mechanism of maternal vascular remodeling during human pregnancy.,Reprod Med Biol,"Remodeling of maternal spiral arteries by invasion of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) is crucial for an adequate blood supply to the fetus. EVT cells that migrate through the decidual tissue destroy the arterial muscular lining from the outside (interstitial invasion), and those that migrate along the arterial lumen displace the endothelium from the inside (endovascular invasion). Numerous factors including cytokines/growth factors, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, and environmental oxygen have been proposed to stimulate or inhibit the differentiation/invasion of EVT. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to depict overall pictures of the mechanism controlling perivascular and endovascular invasion. Potential factors that direct interstitial trophoblast towards maternal spiral artery are relatively high oxygen tension in the spiral artery, maternal platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, and Eph/ephrin system. On the other hand, very little is understood about endovascular invasion except for the involvement of endothelial apoptosis in this process. Only small numbers of molecules such as polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecules and CCR1 have been suggested as specific markers for the endovascular trophoblast. Therefore, an initial step to approach the mechanisms for endovascular invasion could be more detailed molecular characterization of the endovascular trophoblast.",2012,11,1,27-36,10.1007/s12522-011-0102-9,#3916,Sato 2012,Endovascular trophoblast

Following IRB approval, six diagnosed flatfoot sufferers were subjected to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and their scans used to derive patient-specific models. Single-leg stance was modeled, constrained solely through physiologic joint contact, passive soft-tissue tension, extrinsic muscle force, body weight, and without assumptions of idealized mechanical joints. Surgical effect was quantified using simulated mediolateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) X-rays, pedobarography, soft-tissue strains, and joint contact force. Radiographic changes varied across states with the largest average improvements for the tendon transfer (TT) + 10 mm MCO state evidenced through ML and AP talo-1st metatarsal angles. Interestingly, 12 of 14 measures showed increased deformity following TT-only, though all increases disappeared with inclusion of MCO. Plantar force distributions showed medial forefoot offloading concomitant with increases laterally such that the most corrected state had 9.0% greater lateral load. Predicted alterations in spring, deltoid, and plantar fascia soft-tissue strain agreed with prior cadaveric and computational works suggesting decreased strain medially with successive surgical repair. Finally, joint contact force demonstrated consistent medial offloading concomitant with variable increases laterally.

1233,15086901.0,Expression of human heme oxygenase-1 in the thick ascending limb attenuates angiotensin II-mediated increase in oxidative injury.,Kidney Int,"BACKGROUND: Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalyzes the conversion of heme to bilirubin, carbon monoxide (CO), and free iron, thus controlling the level of cellular heme. The medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TALH) is situated in a site of markedly diminished oxygen tension and, as such, is highly vulnerable to ischemic insult. We hypothesize that selective upregulation of HO-1 in TALH by gene transfer attenuates oxidative stress caused by angiotensin II (Ang II). METHODS: An adenoviral vector expressing the human HO-1 under the control of the TALH-specific promoter [Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2 promoter)] was constructed and the cell specific expression of the recombinant adenovirus was examined using several types of cells, including endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, and TALH cells. The effects of HO-1 transduction on HO-1 expression, HO activity and the response to Ang II with respect to cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) up-regulation and oxidative injury [growth-stimulating hormone (GSH) levels and cell death] were determined. RESULTS: Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that human HO-1 was selectively expressed in primary cultured TALH cells following infection with Ad-NKCC2-HO-1. In TALH cells infected with Ad-NKCC2-HO-1, Ang II-stimulated prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels were reduced by 40%. Ang II caused a marked decrease in GSH levels and this decrease was greatly attenuated in TALH cells transduced with Ad-NKCC2-HO-1.

CONCLUSION: These results indicate that TALH cell survival after exposure to oxidative stress injury may be facilitated by selective upregulation of HO-1, thusly blocking inflammation and apoptosis.",2004,65,5,1628-39,10.1111/j.1523-1755.2004.00562.x,#3918,Quan 2004,
1234,8500147.0,Validation of diagnostic criteria for migraine in the Zürich longitudinal cohort study.,Cephalalgia,"This paper reports the results of a systematic assessment of the validity of the specific diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura, as defined by the International Headache Society (IHS), in a longitudinal epidemiologic sample of young adults who were selected from the general population of Zürich, Switzerland. Systematic modification of each of the IHS criteria for migraine without aura yielded one-year weighted prevalence rates ranging from 24% for the unmodified IHS criteria to 9% for the most restrictive definition of migraine. The major implications of the findings for the IHS criteria are: (a) they provide adequate coverage to classify the majority of subjects with headache in the general population; (b) there is little overlap between migraine and tension-type headache, suggesting that the criteria define moderately independent subgroups; (c) the criteria for migraine without aura appear to be too unrestrictive for application in the community, particularly among young adults at the peak period of incidence of migraine; (d) the criteria for ""aura"" need more precise operationalization; and (e) models of validation of the diagnostic criteria suggest that Criterion D of the IHS criteria for migraine without aura should be modified to require both gastrointestinal symptoms and photophobia and phonophobia.",1993,13 Suppl 12,,47-53,10.1177/0333102493013S1210,#3919,Merikangas 1993,
1235,22644202.0,Triptans: over the migraine.,Neurol Sci,"Migraine is a chronic, recurrent, disabling condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Proper acute care treatment for migraineurs is based on triptans, a class of specific medications approved over 20 years ago. Triptans are serotonin (5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonists that are generally effective, well tolerated and safe. Seven triptans are available worldwide, although not all are available in every country, with multiple routes of administration, giving to doctors and patients a wide choice. Despite the similarities of the available triptans, pharmacological heterogeneity offers slightly different efficacy profiles. Triptans are not pain medications, they are abortive migraine medications which cannot prevent migraines. In addition to migraine attacks, triptans are also helpful for cluster headaches. If they are useful in other primary headaches rather than migraine and cluster headache it is yet to be addressed. In the literature there are only limited controlled clinical data to support a migraine-selective activity for triptans. Reports are available about efficacy of triptans to stop attacks of other types of primary headache, such as tension type headache, hypnic headache and other rare forms of primary headaches. On the other hand, sumatriptan failed to treat the indomethacin-responsive primary headache disorders like chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua, nor was it effective in the myofascial temporal muscle pain or in atypical facial pain. Why triptans are effective in so different types of primary headaches remain unclear. Up to date, it is not clear whether the antimigrainous activity of the triptans involves an action only in the periphery or in the CNS as well. Probably we should consider triptans as ""pain killers"" and not only as ""migraine killers"". We clearly need additional studies on triptans as putative analgesics in well-accepted animal and clinical models of acute and chronic somatic pain.",2012,33 Suppl 1,,S193-8,10.1007/s10072-012-1066-1,#3920,Cologno 2012,
1236,10714534.0,A combined approach for the treatment of cervical vertigo.,J Manipulative Physiol Ther,"BACKGROUND: Cervical vertigo is a diagnosis commonly made at both otorhinolaryngologist and chiropractic offices. Hypothesized non-vascular mechanisms are reviewed. Therapeutic approaches have been suggested in the literature, ranging from cervical immobilization to vertebral manipulation. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the patient population with cervical vertigo and observe therapeutic results of a treatment protocol by using distinct conservative modalities. METHODS: Fifteen subjects with cervical vertigo were selected from patients presenting with dizziness at an otorhinolaryngology medical office. Diagnosis was based on specific criteria and results of an otoneurologic examination. All patients were submitted to a treatment protocol, including spinal manipulation, manual therapy on affected muscle groups, analgesic electrotherapy, labyrinth sedation, surface electromyography biofeedback, and an exercise program. Evolution of dizziness complaints and related musculoskeletal dysfunction was observed. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal complaints were present in 93% of the patients, mainly cervical pain, shoulder-girdle pain, and tension-type headache. Median duration of musculoskeletal symptoms was 7.5 years, whereas the median duration of dizziness before the beginning of treatment was 52 days. Treatment duration averaged 5 sessions and 41 days. At the end of treatment, 60% of patients reported remission, 20% reported consistent improvement of vertigo. Remission of musculoskeletal symptoms was observed in 26.7% of patients, and improvement was observed in 60% of patients. CONCLUSION: Chronic, nontraumatic, cervical and shoulder-girdle dysfunction was an important causal and perpetuating factor of cervical vertigo in the population studied, and a consistent improvement was observed with the use of a conservative treatment protocol involving multiple modalities for patients with cervical vertigo. Further controlled studies are needed to access its validity.",2000,23,2,96-100,,#3921,Bracher 2000,

Teachers with voice problems were exposed to the terms 'abuse/misuse' or 'phonotrauma/muscle tension' as describing the origin of common voice problems. Pre- and post-exposures, subjects completed a Voice Self-Efficacy Questionnaire that was specially designed for the study.

1238,33733088.0,Activation of TRPV4 channels leads to a consistent tocolytic effect on human myometrial tissues.,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol X,"BACKGROUND: Human myometrium is a therapeutic target for labor induction and preterm labor. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the physiological role of alternative calcium conductance on contractions triggered by uterotonic drugs in human myometrium. Membrane conductances, supported by TRPV channels, may provide alternative pathways to control either free intracellular and/or submembrane Ca(2+)-concentration, which in turn will modulate membrane polarization and contractile responses. STUDY DESIGN: Uterine biopsies were obtained from consenting women undergoing elective caesarean delivery at term without labor (N = 22). Isometric tension measurements were performed on uterine smooth muscle strips (n = 132). Amplitude, frequency, and area under the curve (AUC) of phasic contractions, as well as resting tone, were measured under various experimental conditions. Immuno histo- and cyto-chemistry, as well as Western blot analyses, have been performed with specific antibodies against TRPV1, TRPV3, and TRPV4 proteins. TRPV4 agonists; GSK1016790A, 4αPDD, and 5,6-EET were used to assess the role of TRPV4 channels on rhythmic activity triggered by 30-300 nM oxytocin. 5 μM of ruthenium red was used as an efficient blocker of ionic current through TRPV4 channels. Nanomolar concentrations of iberiotoxin (IbTX) were also used to confirm the downstream involvement of BKCa channels in controlling uterine reactivity and contractility. RESULTS: The expression of TRPV3 and TRPV4 isoforms has now been demonstrated in human myometrial tissue and cell culture. Nanomolar concentrations of the TRPV4 agonists, (either GSK1016790A or 4αPDD) abolished the rhythmic contractions, resulting in a rapid and consistent tocolytic effect. While 5 μM of ruthenium reversed this tocolytic effect. The addition of IbTX (a BKCa channel blocker) reversed the effects of GSK1016790A. Carvacrol, a TRPV3 agonist, had similar tocolytic effects on rhythmic contractions albeit at higher concentrations. This inhibitory effect was also reversed by ruthenium red. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data suggest that activation of TRPV4 leads to a Ca(2+) entry and subsequent BKCa channel activation (increase in open state probability), which in turn hyperpolarizes the myometrial cell membrane, inactivating L-type Ca(2+) channels and efficiently abrogates contractile activity. Consequently, alternative Ca(2+) conductance supported by TRPV4 plays a physiological role in the modulation of myometrial reactivity.",2021,10,,100124,10.1016/j.eurox.2021.100124,#3923,Villegas 2021,"BKCa, Ca2+-activated large conducting potassium channels"
1239,11714491.0,Impact of activity and arousal upon spectral EEG parameters.,Physiol Behav,"OBJECTIVE: Increased high-frequency EEG activity in patients with insomnia has been posited to reflect increased physiological activity, increased mental content, or increased muscle artifact. In the current study, the impact of physiological arousal and increased EMG upon spectral EEG measures was examined. METHODS: Thirteen normal young adults performed eyes-open and eyes-closed maneuvers in the following conditions: (1) Initial (performed immediately after calibrations); (2) following sitting up and lying down (SIT); (3) following standing up and lying down (STAND); (4) Following a 5-min walk around the building (WALK); (5) during a 5-min mental subtraction task (MATH); (6) During 1 min of gritting teeth (GRIT); and (7) During 1 min of clenching fists (CLENCH). Observations were performed during or immediately after manipulations (AROUSED) and repeated about 10 min later (RELAXED). RESULTS: Significant increases in high-frequency spectral power were found in AROUSED vs. RELAXED conditions (significant at 26, 33, 36,40-42, 44, 46, and 48-49 Hz). Larger significant increases in spectral power were seen in the GRIT condition in the range from 24 to 50 Hz and to a lesser extent in the CLENCH condition. Spectral activity during the MATH condition was similar to that in the AROUSED condition. Heart rate was significantly increased during the GRIT and CLENCH conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, gritting teeth produced large changes in spectral high-frequency power in the same range as produced by the other manipulations. The most parsimonious explanation for such data is that the increased high-frequency activity associated with various forms of arousal is not a specific cortical activity. However, because heart rate was also elevated during the GRIT condition, it implies that high-frequency spectral EEG power may still be a sign of increased central nervous system arousal, although the mechanism may be through increased muscle tension.",2001,74,3,291-8,10.1016/s0031-9384(01)00581-9,#3924,Bonnet 2001,
1240,20008283.0,"17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid targets PPARγ and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase to mediate its anti-inflammatory effects in the lung: role of soluble epoxide hydrolase.",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,"This study sought to assess putative pathways involved in the anti-inflammatory effects of 17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (17,18-EpETE), as measured by a decrease in the contractile reactivity and Ca(2+) sensitivity of TNF-α-pretreated human bronchi. Tension measurements performed in the presence of 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA), a soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH)-specific inhibitor, demonstrated that 17,18-EpETE reduced the reactivity of TNF-α-pretreated tissues. The overexpression of sEH detected in patients with asthma and TNF-α-treated bronchi contributed to the maintenance of hyperresponsiveness in our models, which involved intracellular proinflammatory cascades. The inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ by GW9662 abolished 17,18-EpETE + AUDA-mediated anti-inflammatory effects by inducing IκBα degradation and cytokine synthesis, indicating that PPARγ is a molecular target of epoxy-eicosanoids. Western blot analysis revealed that 17,18-EpETE pretreatment reversed the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) induced by TNF-α in human bronchi. The Ca(2+) sensitivity of human bronchial explants was also quantified on β-escin permeabilized preparations. The presence of SB203580, a p38-MAPK inhibitor, reversed the effect induced by epoxy-eicosanoid in the presence of AUDA on TNF-α-triggered Ca(2+) hypersensitivity by increasing the phosphorylation level of PKC Potentiated Inhibitor Protein-17 (CPI-17) regulatory protein. Moreover, PPARγ ligands, such as rosiglitazone and 17,18-EpETE, decreased the expression of CPI-17, both at the mRNA and protein levels, whereas this effect was countered by GW9662 treatment in TNF-α-treated bronchi. These results demonstrate that 17,18-EpETE is a potent regulator of human lung inflammation and concomitant hyperresponsiveness, and may represent a valuable asset against critical inflammatory bronchial disorder.",2010,43,5,564-75,10.1165/rcmb.2009-0155OC,#3925,Morin 2010,
1241,7020777.0,Rheumatoid arthritis: a study of relaxation and temperature biofeedback training as an adjunctive therapy.,Biofeedback Self Regul,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful systemic disease and is believed to be exacerbated by stress. Relaxation and biofeedback strategies have demonstrated utility in alleviating both pain and stress-related symptomatology, and therefore were tested for efficacy with this disease in a two-phase study. First, 24 patients were taught a relaxation technique and then trained in either temperature elevation or reduction. Second, a group of 15 patients thus trained was compared with 8 others who received traditional physiotherapy modalities. Psychological tests, functional/physical evaluations, as well as measurements related to pain, sleep, and other activities were carried out. Results of the first study revealed significant and positive changes following treatment that were primarily related to pain, tension, and sleep patterns for both groups, but no differential effects were noted between temperature elevation or reduction conditions. This was attributed to both groups having maintained temperature above baseline during biofeedback training. The results of the second study consistently favored the relaxation and biofeedback over the physiotherapy group on the physical/functional indices. The psychological measures tended to remain constant throughout both studies, leading to the conclusion that the effectiveness of treatment was specific to physical functioning rather than to a psychological enhancement of well-being.",1981,6,2,207-23,10.1007/BF00998870,#3926,Achterberg 1981,

METHODS: This prospective-controlled study included 100 adults with Vocal nodules (VN) and Muscle Tension Dysphonia (MTD1), aged between 18 and 65 years, as Experimental Group (EG) and 100 age-matched subjects without any voice disorders as a Control Group (CG). All patients in the EG underwent a phoniatric evaluation, including the administration of the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and laryngeal examination. Both patients of EG and CG underwent a Psychological evaluation by means of standardized tests; Beck's Depression Inventory, State Anxiety Inventory (STAI 1-State Anxiety), Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 2- Trait Anxiety), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were completed by patients. Fisher's exact test and chi-squared test were used to compare all categorical variables, whereas numerical variables were compared either with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon or with Kruskal Wallis test. General linear models were used to study continuous variables between patients and controls and between different groups within the sample. RESULTS: In the study group, the Physical domain (P score) of the VHI was more affected than the Emotional (E score) and Functional ones (F score) both in patients with MTD1 and VN; patients with VN presented a significant difference in P score, E score and VHI total score than patients with isolated MTD 1 (P < 0.005). Psychological assessment showed a significant difference (P < 0.005) between VN and MTD 1 regarding PSS-10 and STAI-1 scores. Low Beck's Depression Inventory scores were present in our sample without significant differences between patients with VN and those with MTD 1. Scores related to psychological distress in the EG were far superior to those obtained by the healthy CG, with markedly significant values especially for PSS-10 (P < 0.0001) and STAI 2 (P < 0.01). Finally, younger patients (18-35 years) with VN showed a highest risk of psychosocial distress. CONCLUSION: the present study identified a high prevalence of psychological distress among patients with vocal disorders without any prior specific psychiatric diagnosis, especially in terms of anxiety and perceived stress. For this reason both these symptoms should be taken into consideration in the diagnostic, therapeutic, and follow-up process of patients with MTD1 and VN.",2020,,,,10.1016/j.jvoice.2020.12.011,#3927,Falanga 2020,AnxietyâDysphoniaâMuscle tension dysphoniaâPsychosocial distressâStressâVocal nodules
1243,19378255.0,A critical role for myoglobin in zebrafish development.,Int J Dev Biol,"The globin family, including hemoglobin, myoglobin, neuroglobin and cytoglobin, plays an important role in oxygen storage and delivery. Myoglobin has been shown to be necessary for cardiac function during development, but no information is currently available on the developmental regulation of myoglobin gene expression during embryogenesis. In this study, we used whole mount in situ hybridization to visualize myoglobin mRNA expression during zebrafish development. Our results show for the first time the spatial and temporal gene expression pattern of myoglobin during embryogenesis. Myoglobin was expressed as a maternal RNA and ubiquitous expression was observed until the end of gastrulation. At later stages of development, we discovered novel expression domains for myoglobin, including several non-muscular ones. Environmental stresses, like low oxygen tension (hypoxia) can lead to a developmental delay in zebrafish embryos. We show here that hypoxic stress induces myoglobin expression in skeletal muscle cells of anterior somites and in the dorsal aorta of zebrafish larvae. Finally, we analyzed the role of myoglobins in development by targeted gene knock-down. Silencing myoglobin in zebrafish embryos with gene-specific morpholinos led to a dose dependent curvature, vascular defects, enlarged pericardia and reduction of the gut. In conclusion, our results indicate that myoglobin plays a crucial role in zebrafish development and is important for angiogenesis and gut development.",2009,53,4,517-24,10.1387/ijdb.082651dv,#3928,Vlecken 2009,
1244,21085966.0,Thyroid autoimmunity may represent a predisposition for the development of fibromyalgia?,Rheumatol Int,"In our previous study, we observed that the presence of autoimmune thyroid disease worsens fibromyalgia (FM) symptoms. The aims of this study are to evaluate whether there is a predisposition for the development of FM in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) with or without subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and in patients with SCH alone and what is the weight of antithyroid antibody positivity and SCH on FM comorbidity. Fifty-two patients, 39 affected by HT with or without SCH and 13 by SCH, were matched with 37 patients affected by FM and 25 healthy subjects. Blood samples were collected from all study subjects for the determination of serum TSH, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, antithyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), antithyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Clinical assessment of patients and controls included the ""Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire"" (FIQ), while pain severity was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Patients and controls were also characterized by the presence of diffuse pain, fatigue, paresthesiae, muscle spasms, non-restful sleep, tension headache and presence of mood disorders. FM comorbidity resulted in twelve HT subjects (31%) and none in SCH patient. In particular, FM comorbidity in HT patients without SCH was 33.3% and in HT patients with SCH was 28.5%. Based on our data, we speculate that maybe there is more than a hypothesis regarding the cause-effect relation between thyroid autoimmunity and the presence of FM, thus suggesting a hypothetical role of thyroid autoimmunity in FM pathogenesis.",2012,32,2,335-41,10.1007/s00296-010-1620-1,#3929,Bazzichi 2012,

METHODS: Three databases, OVID, PubMed, and EMBASE, were used to collect articles. The search terms used were ""cerebrovascular accident (CVA),"" ""stroke"", and ""virtual reality"". Consequently, twenty-one studies were selected in the second screening of meta-analyses. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. RESULTS: The total effect size for VR rehabilitation programs was 0.440. The effect size for upper limb function was 0.431, for lower limb function it was 0.424, and for overall function it was 0.545. The effects of VR programs on specific outcomes were most effective for improving muscle tension, followed by muscle strength, activities of daily living (ADL), joint range of motion, gait, balance, and kinematics. CONCLUSION: The VR training was effective in improving the function in chronic stroke patients, corresponding to a moderate effect size.

1246,8944415.0,Regulation of thrombin-mediated endothelial cell contraction and permeability.,Semin Thromb Hemost,"A variety of physical forces exist in a dynamic equilibrium in the vascular endothelium (EC) monolayer and serve to maintain EC responsiveness while preserving the integrity of the EC monolayer and barrier properties. Thrombin has potent effects on EC permeabilities disrupting the equilibrium between tethering forces (cadherins, focal adhesion plaque) and forces that increase centripetal tension primarily via myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Like other EC effects, thrombin-induced MLC kinase (MLCK) activation is dependent upon receptor proteolysis, Ca2+ mobilization, and activation of protein kinase C (PKC). While EC gap formation is central to barrier dysfunction and dependent upon activation of MLCK, (which phosphorylates MLC) an obligatory event in smooth muscle cell contraction, little is known regarding the events that reverse inflammatory responses, halt the contractile response, and initiate relaxation. However, as these events likely include MLC dephosphorylation, further examination of the processes that regulate MLC protein phosphatase activity, focal intercellular junctions, and extracellular matrix adhesions is needed. These investigations should yield new information as to how receptor occupancy is transduced into specific cellular responses, such as increased permeability, which promotes pathological vascular processes such as tissue edema formation and organ dysfunction.",1996,22,4,309-15,10.1055/s-2007-999025,#3931,Garcia 1996,
1247,19118244.0,Involvement of PTEN promoter methylation in cerebral cavernous malformations.,Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are prevalent cerebral vascular lesions involving aberrant angiogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, is frequently deficient in various pathologies due to mutation or epigenetic alterations. PTEN promoter hypermethylation is a major epigenetic silencing mechanism leading to activation of angiogenesis in tumors. The present study aimed to investigate whether PTEN promoter methylation was involved in CCMs. METHODS: PTEN promoter methylation was detected in surgical specimens of CCMs (n=69) by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The methylation status was correlated to the clinical manifestations and to PTEN expression, which was analyzed by both Western blot and immunohistochemistry. To investigate the endothelial proliferation and the potential signaling pathways affected by PTEN methylation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as phosphor-Akt and phosphor-Erk1,2 were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively, in CCM specimens. RESULTS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed PTEN promoter methylation in 15.9% CCMs. Strikingly, 5 of 6 familial CCMs showed PTEN promoter methylation (83.3%), which was significantly higher than in sporadic cases (9.4%; P<0.001). In addition, PTEN promoter methylation appeared more frequently in multiple CCMs, including familial cases (46.7%), than that in single-lesioned CCMs (11.8%; P<0.05). Immunostaining and Western blot revealed a more significant PTEN downregulation in PTEN-methylated CCMs in comparison to PTEN-unmethylated CCMs. Reduced PTEN expression was inversely correlated to the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and to the activation of Erk1,2, but not of Akt. CONCLUSIONS: We reported here for the first time the involvement of PTEN promoter methylation in CCMs, particularly in familial CCMs, suggesting this epigenetic alteration as a potential pathomechanism of CCMs. The identification of Erk1,2 as triggered signaling in the lesions may be valuable for the development of effective therapy for this disease.",2009,40,3,820-6,10.1161/STROKEAHA.108.526376,#3932,Zhu 2009,
1248,22934004.0,Toward a multiscale description of microvascular flow regulation: o(2)-dependent release of ATP from human erythrocytes and the distribution of ATP in capillary networks.,Front Physiol,"Integration of the numerous mechanisms that have been suggested to contribute to optimization of O(2) supply to meet O(2) need in skeletal muscle requires a systems biology approach which permits quantification of these physiological processes over a wide range of length scales. Here we describe two individual computational models based on in vivo and in vitro studies which, when incorporated into a single robust multiscale model, will provide information on the role of erythrocyte-released ATP in perfusion distribution in skeletal muscle under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Healthy human erythrocytes exposed to low O(2) tension release ATP via a well characterized signaling pathway requiring activation of the G-protein, Gi, and adenylyl cyclase leading to increases in cAMP. This cAMP then activates PKA and subsequently CFTR culminating in ATP release via pannexin 1. A critical control point in this pathway is the level of cAMP which is regulated by pathway-specific phosphodiesterases. Using time constants (~100 ms) that are consistent with measured erythrocyte ATP release, we have constructed a dynamic model of this pathway. The model predicts levels of ATP release consistent with measurements obtained over a wide range of hemoglobin O(2) saturations (sO(2)). The model further predicts how insulin, at concentrations found in pre-diabetes, enhances the activity of PDE3 and reduces intracellular cAMP levels leading to decreased low O(2)-induced ATP release from erythrocytes. The second model, which couples O(2) and ATP transport in capillary networks, shows how intravascular ATP and the resulting conducted vasodilation are affected by local sO(2), convection and ATP degradation. This model also predicts network-level effects of decreased ATP release resulting from elevated insulin levels. Taken together, these models lay the groundwork for investigating the systems biology of the regulation of microvascular perfusion distribution by erythrocyte-derived ATP.",2012,3,,246,10.3389/fphys.2012.00246,#3933,Goldman 2012,ATP transport model
1249,27041786.0,Dynamic finite-strain modelling of the human left ventricle in health and disease using an immersed boundary-finite element method.,IMA J Appl Math,"Detailed models of the biomechanics of the heart are important both for developing improved interventions for patients with heart disease and also for patient risk stratification and treatment planning. For instance, stress distributions in the heart affect cardiac remodelling, but such distributions are not presently accessible in patients. Biomechanical models of the heart offer detailed three-dimensional deformation, stress and strain fields that can supplement conventional clinical data. In this work, we introduce dynamic computational models of the human left ventricle (LV) that are derived from clinical imaging data obtained from a healthy subject and from a patient with a myocardial infarction (MI). Both models incorporate a detailed invariant-based orthotropic description of the passive elasticity of the ventricular myocardium along with a detailed biophysical model of active tension generation in the ventricular muscle. These constitutive models are employed within a dynamic simulation framework that accounts for the inertia of the ventricular muscle and the blood that is based on an immersed boundary (IB) method with a finite element description of the structural mechanics. The geometry of the models is based on data obtained non-invasively by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). CMR imaging data are also used to estimate the parameters of the passive and active constitutive models, which are determined so that the simulated end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes agree with the corresponding volumes determined from the CMR imaging studies. Using these models, we simulate LV dynamics from enddiastole to end-systole. The results of our simulations are shown to be in good agreement with subject-specific CMR-derived strain measurements and also with earlier clinical studies on human LV strain distributions.",2014,79,5,978-1010,10.1093/imamat/hxu029,#3934,Gao 2014,excitationâcontraction coupling

We hypothesized that many, if not all, of these patients would present with discrete laryngeal pathology, divergent from LPR. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, nonintervention. METHODS: Patients presenting to a tertiary laryngology practice with an established diagnosis of LPR as the sole etiology of their hoarseness were included. All subjects completed the Voice Handicap Index and Reflux Symptom Index, in addition to a questionnaire regarding their reflux diagnosis and prior treatment. Laryngoscopic examinations were reviewed by the laryngologist caring for the patients. Reliability of findings was assessed by interpretation of videoendoscopic findings by three outside laryngologists not involved in the care of the patients. RESULTS: Laryngeal pathology distinct from LPR was identified in all 21 patients felt to be causative of the chief complaint of dysphonia. Specifically, the most common findings were benign mucosal lesions and vocal fold paresis (29% each), followed by muscle tension dysphonia (14%). Two patients were found to have vocal fold leukoplakia, of which one was confirmed to be a microinvasive carcinoma upon removal. CONCLUSION: LPR may be overdiagnosed; other etiologies must be considered for patients with hoarseness who fail empiric LPR treatment.

SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive Care Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; EMBASE; LILACS, and the reference lists of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double‐blind randomised controlled trials of dipyrone for the symptomatic relief of acute primary headaches in adults and children. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently screened articles, extracted data, assessed trial quality and analysed results. Relative risks (RRs), risk differences (RDs), weighted mean differences (WMDs), and numbers‐needed‐to‐treat (NNTs) were calculated as appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials involving a total of 636 adult subjects were included. Methodological quality was generally high. One study each evaluated oral and intravenous dipyrone for episodic tension‐type headache (ETTH); two trials evaluated intravenous dipyrone for migraine, but only one of these described pain outcomes. No pediatric trials were identified. The largest trial (n = 356) evaluated two doses (0.5 g, 1 g) of oral dipyrone for ETTH, which were significantly better than placebo for pain relief. The 1 g dose was also significantly better than acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 1 g . A smaller trial (n = 60) evaluated intravenous dipyrone 1 g versus placebo for ETTH. RRs were statistically significant favouring dipyrone for pain‐free and headache improvement outcomes. Finally, one trial (n = 134) evaluated intravenous dipyrone 1 g versus placebo for pain outcomes in patients with migraine. RRs were again statistically significant favouring dipyrone for pain‐free and headache improvement outcomes. Two of the four trials assessed adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported, and no significant differences in adverse events were detected between dipyrone and comparators (placebo and ASA). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from a small number of trials suggests that dipyrone is effective for ETTH and migraine. No serious adverse events were observed in the included trials, but agranulocytosis is rare and would probably not be observed in such a relatively small sample. A study now ongoing in Latin America may clarify the true risk of agranulocytosis associated with dipyrone use.",2014,2014,7,CD004842,10.1002/14651858.CD004842.pub3,#3936,Ramacciotti 2014,
1252,775369.0,Psychological implications in temporomandibular pain and dysfunction.,Oral Sci Rev,"1. Although psychological factors are an important etiological component in producing and perpetuating TMJ disorders a comprehensive view of the problem can be best understood through the concept of multifactorial etiology. 2. Psychological factors operative in TMJ disorders cannot be understood within any single frame of reference. It is appropriate to examine emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal relationships in parallel, not as dichotomous concepts. 3. The symptom complex defined in this review as ""TMJ disorders"" is the musculoskeletal component of a larger group of microtraumatic signs and symptoms, all of which are manifestations of a generalized injury-producing activity termed dysfunction. 4. More explicit diagnoses need to be identified if definitional problems involving TMJ disorders are to be overcome. 5. Classical psychoanalytic conceptualization of the etiology of TMJ disorders has not been systematically examined, but has been widely accepted and found clinically useful by some therapists. 6. Clinical impressions notwithstanding, there is little evidence to indicate that TMJ disorders are correlated with one specific personality trait. Perhaps more definitive assessments will reveal uniform personality characteristics in subclasses of TMJ patients. 7. Emotional factors (e.g., anxiety, fear, frustration, and anger) play a significant role in the etiology of TMJ disorders, in that they elicit muscular tension and oral habits. Although it would appear unlikely that emotionally induced muscle activity is a ""necessary"" factor, it is probable that it will be found a ""sufficient"" cause for TMJ disorders. 8. Learning principles, should not be considered as an alternative etiological position but should be viewed as a framework upon which any psychological theory of etiology must be based. 9. The presence of chronic pain in TMJ patients may be of as much clinical significance in the prognosis as the physical findings associated with the disorder itself. 10. The potential placebo effect resulting from any treatment, coupled with other nonspecific effects of the doctor's attitudes, remains a powerful tool that can be utilized in treating TMJ disorders. A vital ingredient in the placebo effect is the quality of the doctor-patient relationship. 11. Patient evaluation should not only include a) a search for the immediate organic stimulus or biomechanical disturbance, but also b) an assessment of situational or chronic anxiety and other emotional factors and c) an observation of interpersonal styles of behavior commonly associated with the chronically sick patient. 12. Unilateral etiological views of TMJ disorders and rigid treatment approaches need modification. Treatment involving simultaneous dental and psychological approaches appears to have more promise.",1976,7,,30-Mar,,#3937,Rugh 1976,
1253,32685183.0,Efficacy of different load intensity and time-under-tension calf loading protocols for Achilles tendinopathy (the LOADIT trial): protocol for a randomised pilot study.,Pilot Feasibility Stud,"BACKGROUND: Modifying variables in exercise prescription can produce specific effects on Achilles tendinopathy outcomes. This study aims to determine the feasibility of conducting an adequately powered randomised trial in the future to assess the efficacy of different load intensity and time-under-tension exercise parameters for improving pain and function in individuals with persistent midportion Achilles tendinopathy. METHODS: The trial is designed as prospective, four-armed feasibility and randomised pilot trial with 3 months follow-up. Interventions will be provided in a gym setting. The investigator, who will be blind to the allocation of participants, will conduct all pre- and post-intervention assessments. Forty-eight male participants with Achilles tendinopathy will be recruited from the community. We will use a 2 × 2 factorial design with factors of load intensity (six or eighteen repetitions maximum) and time-under-tension (two or six second repetitions). Participants will be randomised into one of the testing groups: six RM with two second repetitions, six RM with six second repetitions, eighteen RM with two second repetitions or eighteen RM with six second repetitions. Trial feasibility will be indicated by the rate of conversion, recruitment and retention, adherence to the interventions by participants, the utility of videoconferencing mode for weekly exercise supervision, incidence of adverse events, and feasibility of future economic evaluation. The secondary clinical outcomes will assess pain and disability, participant impression of change, satisfaction, health-related quality of life, physical activity, work absenteeism, psychological measures at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks, and plantarflexor contractile dysfunction (torque, rate of force development and muscle force steadiness) at baseline and 12 weeks. These clinical outcomes are primarily measured to provide information regarding potential treatment effects and trends. DISCUSSION: The proposed study and follow-up powered randomised trial will be a first step towards determining exercise dose parameters that may optimise outcomes for Achilles tendinopathy. We have chosen to focus on load intensity and time-under-tension, as these parameters are important for tendon adaptation. This work has the potential to lead to more effective exercise loading interventions for Achilles tendinopathy.

1254,19603411.0,Cervids with different vocal behavior demonstrate different viscoelastic properties of their vocal folds.,J Morphol,"The authors test the hypothesis that vocal fold morphology and biomechanical properties covary with species-specific vocal function. They investigate mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) vocal folds, building on, and extending data on a related cervid, the Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). The mule deer, in contrast to the elk, is a species with relatively little vocal activity in adult animals. Mule deer and elk vocal folds show the typical three components of the mammalian vocal fold (epithelium, lamina propria and thyroarytenoid muscle). The vocal fold epithelium and the lamina propria were investigated in two sets of tensile tests. First, creep rupture tests demonstrated that ultimate stress in mule deer lamina propria is of the same magnitude as in elk. Second, cyclic loading tests revealed similar elastic moduli for the vocal fold epithelium in mule deer and elk. The elastic modulus of the lamina propria is also similar between the two species in the low-strain region, but differs at strains larger than 0.3. Sex differences in the stress-strain response, which have been reported for elk and human vocal folds, were not found for mule deer vocal folds. The laminae propriae in mule deer and elk vocal folds are comparatively large. In general, a thick and uniformly stiff lamina propria does not self-oscillate well, even when high subglottic pressure is applied. If the less stiff vocal fold seen in elk is associated with a differentiated lamina propria it would allow the vocal fold to vibrate at high tension and high subglottic pressure. The results of this study support the hypothesis that viscoelastic properties of vocal folds varies with function and vocal behavior.",2010,271,1,11-Jan,10.1002/jmor.10774,#3939,Riede 2010,
1255,22319494.0,"Changes in Physiology before, during, and after Yawning.",Front Evol Neurosci,"The ultimate function of yawning continues to be debated. Here, we examine physiological measurements taken before, during, and after yawns in humans, in an attempt to identify key proximate mechanisms associated with this behavior. In two separate studies we measured changes in heart rate, lung volume, eye closure, skin conductance, ear pulse, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and respiratory rate. Data were depicted from 75 s before and after yawns, and analyzed at baseline, during, and immediately following yawns. Increases in heart rate, lung volume, and eye muscle tension were observed during or immediately following yawning. Patterns of physiological changes during yawning were then compared to data from non-yawning deep inhalations. In one study, respiration period increased following the execution of a yawn. Much of the variance in physiology surrounding yawning was specific to the yawning event. This was not the case for deep inhalation. We consider our findings in light of various hypotheses about the function of yawning and conclude that they are most consistent with the brain cooling hypothesis.",2011,3,,7,10.3389/fnevo.2011.00007,#3940,Corey 2011,brain cooling
1256,22094193.0,Chronic widespread pain in the spectrum of rheumatological diseases.,Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a rheumatic disease characterised by musculoskeletal pain, chronic diffuse tension and/or stiffness in joints and muscles, fatigue, sleep and emotional disturbances and pressure pain sensitivity in at least 11 of 18 tender points. There are currently no instrumental tests or specific diagnostic markers, and the characteristic symptoms of the disease overlap those of many other conditions classified in a different manner. FM is often associated with other diseases that act as confounding and aggravating factors, including primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It has been reported to coexist in 25% of patients with RA, 30% of patients with SLE and 50% of patients with pSS. Its clinical diagnosis is not easy because FM-like symptoms are frequent, and its differential diagnosis with other causes of chronic diffuse pain is difficult. This is even more true in the case of patients who are positive for antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) because, although sensitive, ANA positivity is not specific for SLE or connective tissue diseases, and can also be found in 10-15% of FM patients. Furthermore, composite indices such as the disease activity score (DAS)-28, which are widely used in everyday clinical practice and clinical trials, may be insufficient to evaluate real inflammatory activity in patients with RA associated with chronic pain syndromes such as FM, and can lead to an overestimate of disease activity in RA. The presence of diffuse pain in autoimmune rheumatic diseases compromises the quality of life of the patients, although overall mortality is not increased. A misdiagnosis harms the patients and the community. Rheumatologists should be able to recognise and distinguish primary and secondary FM, and need new guidelines and instruments to avoid making mistakes.",2011,25,2,165-71,10.1016/j.berh.2010.01.011,#3941,Atzeni 2011,
1257,35212241.0,"Acupuncture in Patients Undergoing Cancer Therapy: Their Interest and Belief in Acupuncture is High, But Few are Using It.",Integr Cancer Ther,"OBJECTIVES: Since pre-existing expectations, that is, beliefs, in a treatment may modify outcomes, and acupuncture studies often fail to measure expectations, we wanted to investigate the use of acupuncture, interest, and belief in acupuncture effects among patients undergoing cancer therapy. METHOD: A cross-sectional design, where the participants answered a study-specific questionnaire with questions regarding their use of, interest and belief in acupuncture treatment. RESULTS: A total of 457 patients with cancer (48% men, mean age 65 years) answered the questionnaire. Acupuncture was used by 4 (1%) patients during their cancer therapy, and 368 (83%) expressed an interest in receiving acupuncture. Of the 457 patients, 289 (63%) believed acupuncture to be effective for at least 1 of 17 requested symptoms, most commonly pain (56% of the patients) and muscle tension (40%). They believed acupuncture to be effective for a mean value 3 of the 17 requested symptoms. Women (P < .001), and patients 41 to 65 years (P < .001), expressed a stronger belief in acupuncture effects than others. CONCLUSIONS: Men and older patients expressed weaker beliefs in acupuncture effects than other patients, indicating the importance of collecting expectancy data in future randomized sham-controlled acupuncture studies to be able to treat expectancy as an effect-modifier. The high interest and beliefs in acupuncture effects found also indicate that acupuncture should be available for patients with cancer, for side effects where acupuncture has shown to be effective. In a clinical setting, older men might need more encouragement regarding positive expected outcomes of the acupuncture treatment than younger women.",2022,21,,1.53E+16,10.1177/15347354221077277,#3942,Widgren 2022,acupuncture therapy
1258,34363296.0,"""Epstein-Barr virus associated smooth muscle tumour as an unusual cause of ureteric graft obstruction in a child"".",Pediatr Transplant,"BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a DNA virus with oncogenic potential, especially in immunocompromised patients. EBV can promote smooth muscle proliferation, resulting in EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors (EBV-SMT). METHODS: We report a case of a 10-year-old child with end-stage renal disease secondary to hypoplastic crossed and fused kidneys who underwent kidney transplantation. EBV serology was unknown for the donor and negative for the recipient; three months after he had a primary EBV infection. Two years after the transplantation, percutaneous nephrostomy was performed because of a drop in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and severe dilatation of the graft. Nephrography showed contrast enhancement of the pelvis of the graft kidney and proximal ureter, with a clear blockage at the level of the mid ureter and no passage towards the bladder. A 1.5-cm tumor was found causing intraluminal compression of the mid ureter. RESULTS: Complete resection of the tumor and distal ureter was performed leaving a short proximal ureter. A tension-free uretero-ureteroanastomoses was achieved using the native ureter. There were no surgical complications. Histologic evaluation showed spindle-shaped muscle cells, moderate pleomorphism, and inflammatory infiltration. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for muscle-specific actin. Epstein-Barr encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization was positive, confirming the diagnosis of EBV-associated SMT. CONCLUSIONS: EBV-SMT is an exceedingly rare oncological entity that may develop in either the graft or any other organ. The clinical findings are location related. EBV seroconversion following transplantation might be a risk factor for the development of SMT in solid organ recipients.",2021,25,8,e14109,10.1111/petr.14109,#3943,Szklarz 2021,Epstein-Barr virus
1259,30262190.0,Development of Excised Larynx.,J Voice,"The larynx is a complex organ which has a role in a variety of functions such as phonation, breathing, and swallowing. To research these functions, it is widely accepted that in vivo studies provide more anatomically and physiologically relevant findings. However, invasive procedures are generally needed to measure variables such a subglottal pressure, vocal fold tension and stiffness, and cricothyroid muscle stretch. Performing studies using excised larynges is a useful technique which makes it possible to not only measure phonation parameters but control them as well. Early studies using excised larynges mainly focused on controlling specific parameters and mathematical modeling simulations. The use of these studies has helped further research in laryngeal anatomy, imaging techniques, as well as aerodynamic, acoustic, and biomechanical properties. Here, we describe the progress of this research over the past 5 years. The number of accepted animal models has increased and ideas from excised larynx studies are starting to be applied to treatment methods for laryngeal disorders. These experiments are only valid for an excised situation and must continue to be combined with animal experimentation and clinical observations.",2020,34,1,38-43,10.1016/j.jvoice.2018.07.023,#3944,Luo 2020,Biomechanical Properties
1260,17406058.0,Functions of serotonin in hypoxic pulmonary vascular remodeling.,Cell Biochem Biophys,"In lung vasculature, reversible constriction of smooth muscle cells exists in response to acute decrease in oxygen levels (hypoxia). Progressive and irreversible structural remodeling that reduces blood vessel lumen takes place in response to chronic hypoxia and results in pulmonary hypertension. Several studies have shown a role of serotonin in regulating acute and chronic hypoxic responses. In this review the contribution of serotonin, its receptors and transporter in lung hypoxic responses is discussed. Hypoxic conditions modify plasma levels of serotonin, serotonin transporter activity, and expression of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors. These appear to be required for pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, which depends on the ratio between reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. A heterozygous mutation was identified in the 5-HT2B receptor gene of a patient who developed pulmonary hypertension after fenfluramines anorexigen treatment. This C-terminus truncated 5-HT2B mutant receptor presents lower nitric oxide coupling, and higher cell proliferation capacity than the wild-type receptor. Under low oxygen tension, cells increase the transcription of specific genes via stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1. Factors such as angiotensin II or thrombin that can also control HIF-1 pathway contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling. The 5-HT2B receptor via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt activates nuclear factor-kappaB, which is involved in the regulation of HIF-1 expression. Acontrol of HIF- 1 by 5-HT2B receptors explains why expression of pulmonary vascular remodeling factors, such as endothelin-1 or transforming growth factor-beta, which is HIF-1-alpha regulated, is not modified in hypoxic 5-HT2B receptor mutant mice. Understanding the detailed mechanisms involved in lung hypoxic responses may provide general insight into pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis.",2007,47,1,33-44,10.1385/cbb:47:1:33,#3945,Esteve 2007,
1261,28233064.0,Standard of Open Surgical Repair of Suprapubic Incisional Hernias.,World J Surg,"BACKGROUND: Suprapubic incisional hernias (SIH) are a rare wall defect, whose surgical management is challenging because of limited literature. The proximity of the hernia to bone, vascular, nerve, and urinary structures, and the absence of posterior rectus sheath in this location imply adequate technique of surgical repair. We aimed to describe a cohort of female patients operated on for SIH after gynecological surgery using a homogeneous surgical technique and to report surgical outcomes. METHODS: The records of all consecutive patients operated on for SIH in a specialized surgical center between January 2009 and January 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. The same open technique was performed, i.e., using a mesh placed inferiorly in the preperitoneal space of Retzius, with large overlap, and fixed on the Cooper's ligaments, through the muscles superiorly and laterally with strong tension, in a sublay or underlay position. RESULTS: The cohort included 71 female patients. SIH were recurrent in 31% of patients and was related to cesarean in 32 patients (45.1%) and to gynecologic surgery in 39 patients (54.9%). The mesh was totally extraperitoneal in 76.1% of patients. The postoperative mortality rate was null. The rate of specific surgical complications was 29.6%. After a median follow-up of 30.3 months, the recurrence rate was 7%. CONCLUSION: The open approach for SIH repair was safe and efficient. Due to the paucity of adequate scientific studies, this reproducible open method could help moving toward a standardization of SIH surgical management.",2017,41,6,1466-1474,10.1007/s00268-017-3892-z,#3946,Renard 2017,
1262,32089967.0,"ISOKINETIC TRUNK STRENGTH, VALIDITY, RELIABILITY, NORMATIVE DATA AND RELATION TO PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND LOW BACK PAIN: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE.",Int J Sports Phys Ther,"BACKGROUND: Isokinetic testing of the trunk is ubiquitous in the literature and with training, however, there is a lack of normative data for adolescents and adult athletes. PURPOSE: The purpose of the current review is to present and summarize data about isokinetic trunk strength assessment relative to young, adolescent and adult athletes. Testing position variations, reliability values by age groups, utilization of strength measures and normative data by age groups have been discussed. The information presented within this review are of practical importance for assessment of isokinetic trunk strength to appraise the athlete's current strength level and provide suitable conditioning training program. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: NCBI-PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus were searched to identify relevant correlation and intervention studies/trials related to isokinetic testing of the trunk. Forty-two studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this literature review. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The validity of isokinetic trunk measures (i.e. peak torque; flexion/extension ratios) can be affected by a number of factors including whether the individual is tested in seated or standing position, which can alter the muscle length-tension relationship. Reliability is excellent for some strength measures and moderate to high for muscle endurance. Extension and concentric measures tend to have better reliability than flexion and eccentric measures respectively, while females show typically higher reliability scores than men due to the difficulty in controlling men's body position when testing. Normative data for various populations are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle assessment methods using an isokinetic dynamometer are considered reliable with high correlations to peak strength values and flexor/extensor ratios over age groups. However, caution should be exercised when interpreting position-specific isokinetic test results that measure trunk flexion (standing vs seated position). Still, there are indications that low-velocity movements are more reliable for measuring trunk strength. In adolescence, boys appear stronger than girls, with higher values for trunk extensors. Trunk flexors and extensors ratios decrease with growth. Data of isokinetic trunk muscle performance seems to be correlated not only to anthropometric parameters but also to sports discipline and training volume. The effects of sport on the muscular strength of the trunk may have both a preventive factor and a possible risk factor for low back pain. There is evidence for an association between high physical workloads and back injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.",2020,15,1,160-174,,#3947,AZBM 2020,core

Models were constrained through physiologic joint contact, passive soft-tissue tension, active muscle force, full body weight, and without idealized joints. Models were validated against patient-matched controls using clinically utilized radiographic angle and distance measures and plantar force distributions in the medial forefoot, lateral forefoot, and hindfoot. Each model further predicted changes in strain for the spring ligament, deltoid ligament, and plantar fascia, as well as joint contact loads for three midfoot joints, the talonavicular, navicular-1st cuneiform, and calcaneocuboid. Radiographic agreement ranged across measures, with average absolute deviations of <5° and <4 mm indicating generally good agreement. Postoperative plantar force loading in patients and models was reduced for the medial forefoot and hindfoot concomitant with increases in the lateral forefoot. Model predicted reductions in medial soft-tissue strain and increases in lateral joint contact load were consistent with in vitro observations and elucidate the biomechanical mechanisms of repair. Thus, validated rigid-body models offer promise for the investigation of foot/ankle kinematics and biomechanical behaviors that are difficult to measure in vivo.",2014,42,9,1913-22,10.1007/s10439-014-1048-y,#3948,Spratley 2014,
1264,32250743.0,Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with sex-specific alterations in the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP relaxing pathway in the human umbilical vein.,Placenta,"INTRODUCTION: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity, and is linked to an increased risk to develop chronic diseases in adulthood. We previously demonstrated that IUGR is associated, in female neonates, with a decreased nitric oxide (NO)-induced relaxation of the umbilical vein (UV). The present study aimed to investigate the contribution of the smooth muscle components of the NO/cyclic GMP (cGMP) pathway to this alteration. METHODS: UVs were collected in growth-restricted or appropriate for gestational age (AGA) human term newborns. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) were studied by Western blot, cGMP production by ELISA and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) activity using a colorimetric assay. Contribution of PDEs was evaluated using the non-specific PDEs inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) in isolated vessel tension studies. RESULTS: NO-induced relaxation was reduced in IUGR females despite increased sGC protein and activity, and some increase in PKG protein compared to AGA. In males, no significant difference was observed between both groups. In the presence of IBMX, NO-stimulated cGMP production was significantly higher in IUGR than AGA females. Pre-incubation with IBMX significantly improved NO-induced relaxation in all groups and abolished the difference between IUGR and AGA females. CONCLUSION: IUGR is associated with sex-specific alterations in the UV's smooth muscle. The impaired NO-induced relaxation observed in growth-restricted females is linked to an imbalance in the NO/cGMP pathway. The beneficial effects of IBMX suggest that PDEs are implicated in such alteration and they could represent promising targets for therapeutic intervention.",2020,93,,83-93,10.1016/j.placenta.2020.02.014,#3949,Beaumann 2020,Cyclic guanosine monophosphate
1265,14636763.0,A new method: perforator-based tissue expansion for a preexpanded free cutaneous perforator flap.,Burns,"Recent advances in concepts of preexpanded free flaps have made it possible to replace larger postburn contracture area. Free anterolateral thigh (ALT) cutaneous perforator flaps are popular due to constant, reliable anatomy and various clinical applications in our department. Combination of preexpansion, perforator-based prefabrication of tissue expansion and a free anterolateral thigh flap is first introduced and developed to resurface the large territory of postburn cervical contracture in a 33-year-old female patient with second to third degree flame burn with a 45% total body surface area (TBSA) involvement. The limited lateral flexion and rotation was noted despite aggressive rehabilitation for 6 months. The 650cm(3) kidney-shaped tissue expander was inserted around the myocutaneous perforator under the fascia via the midlateral thigh incision in first stage. Two months later right lateral neck scar (size=25cm x 13cm) was excised after serial clinic saline injection. The preexpanded free flap (size=29cm x 15cm) combined with z plasty and capsulectomy was harvested and covered in the contracture defect. A flap totally survived. One-staged resurfacing was achieved with immediate postoperative improvement. The hospital stay was 6 days. The donor site was closed primarily. After 6 months follow-up, the functional improvement was assessed as follows: an increase in rotation of 14 degrees (preoperative 74 degrees to postoperative 88 degrees ); and an increase in lateral flexion of 10 degrees (preoperative 30 degrees to postoperative 40 degrees ). The prefabrication of the free cutaneous perforator flap by perforator-based tissue expansion above the muscle has several advantages: (1) it provides accurate and safe expansion without damage of any perforator compared with the blunt dissection; (2) larger territory of free flaps can be used for burn reconstruction; (3) donor site is primarily closed with low tension; (4) it is not a random expanded flap due to direct expansion of specific skin territory around the perforator. The disadvantages are two-staged procedures, complications of tissue expansion (e.g. infection, extrusion), the possibility of compression of pedicles.",2003,29,8,845-8,10.1016/s0305-4179(03)00197-9,#3950,Tsai 2003,

1267,23352061.0,Quantifying component parts of indirect and direct voice therapy related to different voice disorders.,J Voice,"Voice therapy changes how people use and care for their voices. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) have a multitude of choices from which to modify patient's vocal behaviors. Six SLPs performed 1461 voice therapy sessions and quantified the percentage of time spent in eight component parts of indirect and four component parts of direct voice therapy across five common voice disorders. Voice therapy data collection forms were prospectively completed immediately following each therapy visit. The SLPs were free to choose the component parts of voice therapy best suited for their respective patients. Results showed that direct voice therapy represented more than 75% of the treatment time across all voice therapy sessions. In the components of direct voice therapy, there was no statistical difference between percentages of time spent in resonant voice and flow phonation across all voice disorders. However, a significant difference was found for the time spent addressing transfer to conversational speech for muscle tension dysphonia, lesions, and scar than for vocal immobility and atrophy. Interestingly, while SLPs used a more common approach to direct voice therapy across voice disorders, they tended to vary the use of indirect components of therapy across voice disorders with certain components being addressed in greater length for specific voice disorders. Collectively, these results indicate that although SLPs may individualize their approach to indirect voice therapy, when it comes to direct voice therapy, SLPs have a common approach to voice therapy regardless of voice disorder.",2013,27,2,210-6,10.1016/j.jvoice.2012.11.007,#3952,Gartner-Schmidt 2013,
1268,22104632.0,Pain indicators in brain-injured critical care adults: an integrative review.,Aust Crit Care,"INTRODUCTION: Health professionals are confronted with the difficulty of adequately evaluating pain in critically ill, brain-injured patients, as these patients are often unable to self-report. In addition, their confused and stereotyped behaviours may change their responses to pain; the indicators and descriptors generally used to evaluate pain in the critically ill may therefore not be appropriate for brain-injured patients. AIM: The aim of this integrative review was to identify clinically measurable and observable pain indicators and descriptors for brain-injured, critically ill adults. METHOD: A search of electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Embase) combined with cross-referencing was performed. Articles were included if they described pain indicators in critically ill adults and included brain-injured patients in their population. RESULTS: Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. They were critically appraised for their quality and their relevance for the population of brain-injured patients. Behavioural pain indicators such as facial expressions, body movements and muscle tension were found in all of the articles. However, the descriptions of the indicators differ from one article to another. The intensity and nature of behavioural pain responses vary according to the level of consciousness. Changes in physiological parameters have also been reported, but these results are inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Additional research is needed to identify and better describe pain indicators that are specific to brain-injured patients in the ICU. Studies with large samples, different brain injury diagnoses and various levels of consciousness are warranted.",2012,25,2,110-8,10.1016/j.aucc.2011.10.002,#3953,Roulin 2012,
1269,24189039.0,Myofibroblasts: trust your heart and let fate decide.,J Mol Cell Cardiol,"Cardiac fibrosis is a substantial problem in managing multiple forms of heart disease. Fibrosis results from an unrestrained tissue repair process orchestrated predominantly by the myofibroblast. These are highly specialized cells characterized by their ability to secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) components and remodel tissue due to their contractile properties. This contractile activity of the myofibroblast is ascribed, in part, to the expression of smooth muscle α-actin (αSMA) and other tension-associated structural genes. Myofibroblasts are a newly generated cell type derived largely from residing mesenchymal cells in response to both mechanical and neurohumoral stimuli. Several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors are induced in the injured heart, and in conjunction with elevated wall tension, specific signaling pathways and downstream effectors are mobilized to initiate myofibroblast differentiation. Here we will review the cell fates that contribute to the myofibroblast as well as nodal molecular signaling effectors that promote their differentiation and activity. We will discuss canonical versus non-canonical transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), angiotensin II (AngII), endothelin-1 (ET-1), serum response factor (SRF), transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and mechanical signaling pathways that are required for myofibroblast transformation and fibrotic disease.

1270,2202557.0,Central neural control of esophageal motility: a review.,Dysphagia,"We review recent studies on the central neural control of esophageal motility, emphasizing the anatomy and chemical coding of esophageal pathways in the spinal cord and medulla. Sympathetic innervation of the proximal esophagus is derived primarily from cervical and upper thoracic paravertebral ganglia, whereas that of the lower esophageal sphincter and proximal stomach is derived from the celiac ganglion. In addition to noradrenaline, many sympathetic fibers in the esophagus contain neuropeptide Y (NPY), and both noradrenaline and NPY appear to decrease blood flow and motility. Preganglionic neurons innervating the cervical and upper thoracic ganglia are located at lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal levels. The preganglionic innervation of the celiac ganglion arises from lower thoracic spinal levels. Both acetylcholine (ACh) and enkephalin (ENK) have been localized in sympathetic preganglionic neurons, and it has been suggested that ENK acts to pre-synaptically inhibit ganglionic transmission. Spinal afferents from the esophagus are few, but have been described in lower cervical and thoracic dorsal root ganglia. A significant percentage contain calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). The central distribution of spinal afferents, as well as their subsequent processing within the spinal cord, have not been addressed. Medullary afferents arise from the nodose ganglion and terminate peripherally both in myenteric ganglia, where they have been postulated to act as tension receptors, and, to a lesser extent, in more superficial layers. Centrally, these afferents appear to end in a discrete part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) termed the central subnucleus. The transmitter specificity of the majority of these afferents remains unknown. The central subnucleus, in turn, sends a dense and topographically discrete projection to esophageal motor neurons in the rostral portion of the nucleus ambiguous (NA). Both somatostatin-(SS) and ENK-related peptides have been localized in this pathway. Finally, motor neurons from the rostral NA innervate striated portions of the esophagus. In addition to ACh, these esophageal motor neurons contain CGRP, galanin (GAL), N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The physiological effect of these peptides on esophageal motility remains unclear. Medullary control of smooth muscle portions of the esophagus have not been thoroughly investigated.",1990,5,1,35-51,10.1007/BF02407391,#3955,CunninghamETJr 1990,
1271,28654586.0,Botulinum Toxin for Neck Rejuvenation: Assessing Efficacy and Redefining Patient Selection.,Plast Reconstr Surg,"BACKGROUND: The ""Nefertiti lift"" consists of injecting the platysmal bands and the inferior border of the mandible with botulinum toxin. No clinical trial has evaluated its effect on the different lower face and neck aging components, and little is known about the clinical characteristics that predict treatment success. METHODS: Patients were injected with abobotulinumtoxinA along the inferior border of the mandible and into the platysmal bands. Using standardized preinjection and postinjection photographs, the jowls, marionette lines, oral commissures, neck volume, and platysmal bands at maximal contraction and at rest were assessed with validated photonumeric scales. In addition, the overall appearance of the lower face and neck was evaluated by the Investigators and Subjects Global Aesthetic Improvement Score. Pain and patient satisfaction rates were also evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty patients were injected with a mean dose of 124.9 U of abobotulinumtoxinA per patient. Platysmal bands at rest and with maximal tension reached a statistically significant improvement. The other components showed a tendency for improvement but did not reach statistical significance; 93.3 percent of investigators and patients rated the overall results as improved, and 96.6 percent of patients were satisfied with their results. When comparing the patients who improved the most to all the other patients, they had lower preinjection region-specific scores. CONCLUSIONS: The Nefertiti lift can be used on its own or in conjunction with other rejuvenating procedures. It is particularly helpful in younger patients with platysma muscle hyperactivity and retained skin elasticity.

1272,21051195.0,Differences between flexible and rigid endoscopy in assessing the posterior glottic chink.,J Voice,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether different modalities of laryngeal examination produce differences in the assessment of the posterior glottic chink (PGC), and whether the prevalence of PGC differs by gender. INTRODUCTION: The PGC has been described as a triangular laryngeal space between the posterior laryngeal wall and the vocal processes during glottic closure found commonly in human females, but less often in males. The purpose of this study was not only to identify whether there are gender differences in prevalence of posterior glottic but also to determine whether there is a difference in detection of this configuration dependent on the modality of laryngeal imaging, specifically flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy (FNPL) versus rigid laryngoscopy (RL). METHODS: A review of 104 consecutive initial laryngeal examinations was performed. All patients underwent both flexible laryngoscopy (FL) and RL performed under stroboscopic light. Patients with immobile vocal folds, masses causing glottic gaps, atrophy, or severe muscle tension dysphonia causing an inability to fully visualize the entire length of the vocal fold were excluded. In the remaining patients, the posterior glottic configuration showing a posterior chink in relation to the vocal process was graded on a 0-4 scale (called the Posterior Glottic Closure Score [PGCS]); 0 was used to indicate a closed glottis and 4 the most open configuration without creating a complete glottic gap. PGCSs for males were compared with those of females, and the PGCSs obtained by flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy was compared with RL. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included in the study. Twenty-four of the patients were male, and 28 were female. The average age of the patients was 48.4 years (SD±17.35), and the range was 15-81 years. On RL, eight males had a PGCS 1-4, that is, evidence of PGC, and 23 females had a PGCS 1-4. On flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy, only four males had a PGCS 1-4 and 24 females had PGCS 1-4. Twenty-two females had a PGC detected by both modalities, and the PGCS was significantly higher using RL (2.73±0.70 vs. 2.14±0.834) than FL. For the four males in which PGC was detected by both modalities, there was no statistical significance when comparing the PGCS between RL and FL (1.75±0.96 vs. 1.75±0.5, P<0.05). When comparing only males and females who had a PGC (PGCS 1-4), females had a higher PGCS (2.65±0.78) than males (1.75±0.71, P<0.05) on RL, indicating a more open posterior glottis in females. On flexible examination, there was no difference detected in the average PGCS, 2.08±0.83 for females and males 1.75±0.50. PGCs were more common in younger (age 43 years) than older (age 54-56 years) subjects for both laryngoscopic modalities. CONCLUSION: From this pilot study, we determined that there is a difference in male and female PGC prevalence and size. PGC is more common in females than males. Prevalence (or the detection rate) is about the same with RL and FL in females, but higher with RL than FL in males. The average score of the glottic opening, when present, was statistically significantly different between RL and FL in females but not in males. Furthermore, females had a larger PGCS on both modalities when compared with males, although this difference was only found to be statistically significant on RL; and complete glottic closure was more common in older than in younger subjects.",2011,25,5,591-5,10.1016/j.jvoice.2010.06.006,#3957,Chandran 2011,
1273,32630679.0,Pelvic Symmetry Is Influenced by Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex during Young Children's Gait.,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Gait is one of the examined functions in child development. It should be economical and symmetrical. One test increasingly used by physiotherapists and pediatricians is asymmetrical tonic neck reflex (ATNR). Physiologically, it is observed from in utero up to six postnatal months. This reaction is inhibited with the growing maturation of the central nervous system (CNS). In some children, when the natural process of development is incorrect, ATNR manifests later in life, when it is observed as an automatic response of muscle tension to head rotation. Analysis of pelvis symmetry in the gait of children with active ATNR is important for better understanding their specific movements. In the gait of children with persistent ATNR, some variations are observed. The aim of the study was to investigate the gait symmetry of preschool children and the influence of persistent ATNR. Fifty preschool children with a trace form of ATNR were examined. The distribution of the gait parameters was determined using a BTS G-SENSOR measurement instrument. ATNR negatively influences pelvic obliquity and pelvic rotation (p < 0.01). Younger children have a statistically higher symmetry index of pelvis obliquity in the examined group (p = 0.015). Boys obtain a higher result of symmetry in pelvic tilt than girls in the group (p = 0.027). ATNR affects walking symmetry in preschool children, thus evaluation of the reflex activity and then proper therapy is required to support proper development.",2020,17,13,,10.3390/ijerph17134759,#3958,Gieysztor 2020,asymmetrical tonic neck reflex
1274,35378081.0,"Caveolin-3 prevents swelling-induced membrane damage via regulation of I(Cl,swell) activity.",Biophys J,"Caveola membrane structures harbor mechanosensitive chloride channels (MCCs; including chloride channel 2, chloride channel 3, and SWELL1, also known as LRRC8A) that form a swelling-activated chloride current (I(Cl,swell)) and play an important role in cell volume regulation and mechanoelectrical signal transduction. However, the role of the muscle-specific caveolar scaffolding protein caveolin-3 (Cav3) in regulation of MCC expression, activity, and contribution to membrane integrity in response to mechanical stress remains unclear. Here we showed that Cav3-transfected (Cav3-positive) HEK293 cells were significantly resistant to extreme (<20 milliosmole) hypotonic swelling compared with native (Cav3-negative) HEK293 cells; the percentage of cells with membrane damage decreased from 45% in Cav3-negative cells to 17% in Cav3-positive cells (p < 0.05). This mechanoprotection was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) when cells were exposed to the I(Cl,swell)-selective inhibitor 4-[(2-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]butanoic acid (10 μM). These results were recapitulated in isolated mouse ventricular myocytes, where the percentage of cardiomyocytes with membrane damage increased from 47% in control cells to 78% in 4-[(2-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5-yl)oxy]butanoic acid-treated cells (p < 0.05). A higher resistance to hypotonic swelling in Cav3-positive HEK293 cells was accompanied by a significant twofold increase of I(Cl,swell) current density and SWELL1 protein expression, whereas ClC-2/3 protein levels remained unchanged. Förster resonance energy transfer analysis showed a less than 10-nm membrane and intracellular association between Cav3 and SWELL1. Cav3/SWELL1 membrane Förster resonance energy transfer efficiency was halved in mild (220 milliosmole) hypotonic solution as well as after disruption of caveola structures via cholesterol depletion by 1-h treatment with 10 mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin. A close association between Cav3 and SWELL1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. Our findings indicate that, in the MCCs tested, SWELL1 abundance and activity are regulated by Cav3 and that their association relies on membrane tension and caveola integrity. This study highlights the mechanoprotective role of Cav3, which is facilitated by complimentary SWELL1 expression and activity.",2022,121,9,1643-1659,10.1016/j.bpj.2022.04.001,#3959,TurnerDGP 2022,

It is unclear whether the dysfunction caused by hyperglycaemia is blood vessel specific and whether the dysfunction is exacerbated following an atherogenic diet. Abdominal aorta, iliac, and mesenteric arteries were dissected from New Zealand White rabbits following either a 4-week normal or atherogenic diet (n = 6-12 per group). The arteries were incubated ex vivo in control or high glucose solution (20 mM or 40 mM) for 2 h. Isometric tension myography was used to determine endothelial-dependent vasodilation. The atherogenic diet reduced relaxation as measured by area under the curve (AUC) by 25% (p < 0.05), 17% (p = 0.06) and 40% (p = 0.07) in the aorta, iliac, and mesenteric arteries, respectively. In the aorta from the atherogenic diet fed rabbits, the 20 mM glucose altered EC(50) (p < 0.05). Incubation of the iliac artery from atherogenic diet fed rabbits in 40 mM glucose altered EC(50) (p < 0.05). No dysfunction occurred in the mesentery with high glucose incubation following either the normal or atherogenic diet. High glucose induced endothelial dysfunction appears to be blood vessel specific and the aorta may be the optimal artery to study potential therapeutic treatments of hyperglycaemia induced endothelial dysfunction.",2020,12,7,,10.3390/nu12072108,#3960,Tacey 2020,atherosclerosis
1276,9428178.0,Complications of prosthetic surgery in the dysplastic hip.,Chir Organi Mov,"The complications of prosthetic surgery in the dysplastic hip have specific features that are related to the conditions that make the realization of an implant technically complex; the altered primary acetabular and femoral morphology, the sequelae of previous non-substitutive surgery, and the consequent possible upsetting of joint biomechanics. It is possible to distinguish between complications relative to the skeleton, joint biomechanics, and soft tissues. Prosthetization of the acetabular skeletal aspect may encounter frequent errors in reconstruction (incongruous reaming-too much or too little-the improper use of bone grafts), errors in orientation of the acetabular component (excessive verticalization and anteversion) that are considered early complications. The same technical errors may cause late complications in the implant, or its migration. At the femoral level the particular shape of the medullary canal and of the femoral neck may lead to defects in orientation in anteversion and fracture of the diaphysis. Possible complications of a biomechanical nature are essentially to be related to changes in the center of rotation in both a craniocaudal and a mediolateral sense and or to the heterometry of the limbs. In the soft tissues, muscle tension may become too much or too little, in relation to recovery of joint biomechanics; in cases with significant lengthening neurologic deficit may occur. Accurate preoperative planning (traditional x-rays and CT scan), the choice of the most suitable surgical route of access, and the different prosthetic models that adapt best to the different morphological situations, the expertise of the surgeon, are all essential elements in monitoring complications.",1997,82,2,177-82,,#3961,Castelli 1997,
1277,31473814.0,The effect of sagittal hip angle on lumbar and hip coordination and pelvic posterior shift during forward bending.,Eur Spine J,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of dynamic sagittal hip angle on lumbar and hip coordination and pelvic posterior shift during forward bending. METHODS: A total of 44 asymptomatic younger female volunteers were recruited to this study. Following measurement of trunk forward bending, participants were divided into three groups based on hip flexion angle: group 1, < 30°; group 2, ≥ 30° and < 50°; and group 3, ≥ 50°. Lumbar spine and hip coordination and pelvic backward shift were recorded during trunk forward bending using a three-dimensional ultrasonic motion analysis system. RESULTS: Pelvic and total angles increased with hip angle (group 3 > group 2 > group 1; p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively), whereas lumbar/hip and pelvic/hip angle ratios decreased significantly (p < 0.001). The degree of pelvic posterior shift increased to a limited extent, whereas the pelvic posterior shift/hip angle ratio decreased significantly (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic subjects with limited hip flexion showed reduced total pelvic anterior rotation and greater relative proportion of pelvic motion than insufficient hip motion. These subjects tended to increase the pelvic posterior shift/hip angle ratio during trunk forward bending, possibly increasing passive tension by elongating the hamstring muscles to increase hip motion. The results of this study provide information that will improve the assessment of lumbar spine and hip coordination patterns and facilitate movement strategies by determining the specific requirements of individuals.

1278,21073084.0,"Patterns of lumbar myelographic findings in patients with LBP a 5 years retrospective study at Yehuleshet Higher Clinic, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",Ethiop Med J,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is usually defined as pain, muscle tension, or stiffness localized below the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds, with or without leg pain (sciatica). LBP is a common health problem and the imaging of which need carful clinical diagnostic triage. Most of us will experience at least one episode of LBP during our life. Despite its burden to the health facilities, more than 90% have no identifiable organic cause so their diagnosis is based on exclusion of other specific pathologies. OBJECTIVE: The study asses level of association of LBP and lumbar Myelographic findings in a higher clinic in Addis Ababa and provide baseline information of patterns of lumbar myelographic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective record review of patients with LBP for whom lumbar myelography was done at Yehuleshet Higher Clinic. Data were collected from the clinics record, both hard and soft copy records were used a total of 1688 patients who had lumbar myelography study done for a complaint of LBP in the years from 2002-2008 are included in the study. RESULTS: Among the study subjects 895 (53%) were males and 793 (47%) were females. Mean age was 42.41 +/- 13.22. 1073 (63.6%) had abnormal myelographic findings and the rest 615 (36.4%) had normal lumbar myelography. The commonest abnormality is disc prolapse 36.7% with L4-L5 and L5-S1 being the commonest sites. CONCLUSION: Even if lumbar myelography showed abnormal findings in 63.6% a significant number of the studies (36.4%) were normal indicating lack of optimal clinical triage. Overall in countries like ours, where the recommended primary imaging modality, i.e., MRI is inaccessible and expensive, the value of myelography is unquestionable. RECOMMENDATION: But because of the invasive nature of the examination which also uses radiation, a diagnostic clinical triage should be taken first before subjecting patients to Myelographic procedures. Further studies to assess the positive predictive value of myelography with surgical confirmation are recommended.",2010,48,3,229-36,,#3963,Kebede 2010,

This systematic review was aimed to assess the effects of AS 195 in patients with CVI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify trials that reported the impact of red vine leaf extract on CVI. The primary outcomes investigated were Leg (limb) volume, calf circumference, ankle circumference, tired and heavy legs, a sensation of tension, tingling sensation, and pain. RESULTS: From the 56 studies, 5 trials were selected according to our inclusion criteria. Red vine leaf extract significantly improved numbers of outcomes (lower leg volume, calf and ankle circumference, tired, heavy legs, tingling sensation, pain, the sensation of tension in the legs, cutaneous microcirculation, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure) in only some trials.

In 2-dimension (D) cultures, MSC exhibit a morphology similar to fibroblasts, are able to inhibit T lymphocyte and natural killer cell proliferation, and can be differentiated into adipocytes, chondrocytes, or osteoblasts if exposed to specific media. Here we show that medullar MSC cultured in 2D formed an adherent stroma of cells expressing well-organized microfilaments containing α-smooth muscle actin and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA. MSC could be grown in 3D in collagen membranes generating a structure which, upon exposition to 50 mM KCl or to an alternating electric current, developed a contractile strength that averaged 34 and 45 μN/mm(2), respectively. Such mechanical tension was similar in intensity and in duration to that of human placenta and was annihilated by isosorbide dinitrate or 2,3-butanedione monoxime. Membranes devoid of MSC did not exhibit a significant contractility. Moreover, MSC nested in collagen membranes were able to control T lymphocyte proliferation, and differentiated into adipocytes, chondrocytes, or osteoblasts.

1281,1536101.0,The management of breast cancer with immediate or delayed reconstruction.,Adv Surg,"In patients with stage I and stage II disease who are candidates for a mastectomy, either immediate or delayed reconstruction can be accomplished with remarkably good cosmetic results. Age is not a specific contraindication to reconstruction, but, in my experience, the majority of women over 55 years of age are not interested. Mastectomy or modified radical mastectomy should be performed in these patients using a technique that facilitates delayed reconstruction. The patient may or may not elect to have the reconstruction eventually. Immediate or delayed reconstruction is appealing to a significant number of women under 55 years of age. They should see a plastic surgeon in consultation and the advantages and disadvantages of a subpectoral silicone implant vs. a myocutaneous flap (usually a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap) should be discussed in detail. The patient's acceptance of the cosmetic result is better if she has an opportunity preoperatively to review photographs of reconstructed breasts and to discuss the results with women who have undergone a similar procedure. The timing of the reconstruction is a matter of clinical judgment; no prospective clinical trials have been performed. Immediate reconstruction is feasible if the skin flaps will accept the slight tension produced by either a subpectoral implant or a transposed muscle flap. A subpectoral silicone implant produces a satisfactory cosmetic result in the majority of patients, particularly if both breasts are supported by a properly fitting brassiere. In long-term follow-up, infection, contracture, and displacement requiring removal and reinsertion occur in approximately 15% of patients. Reconstruction by a myocutaneous flap is a technically more difficult operation. The operating time is prolonged significantly and blood loss is increased. In my opinion, a myocutaneous flap probably is not worth the risk of a heterologous transfusion. The long-term cosmetic results, however, are considerably better in comparison to a subpectoral silicone implant. The reconstructed breast is much more mobile, making it a more realistic replacement of the original breast. In most cases, it is better to perform this type of reconstruction with a myocutaneous flap as a delayed procedure. In experienced hands, however, immediate reconstruction, with the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap harvested while the modified radical mastectomy is being performed, is perfectly feasible. Nipple/areolar reconstruction is available. However, the cosmetic results are only fair to good, and the patient should be aware of this before undergoing the procedure. The problem of symmetry between the breasts requires a good deal of judgment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1992,25,,51-64,,#3966,Baker 1992,
1282,36044556.0,From motor control to team play in simulated humanoid football.,Sci Robot,"Learning to combine control at the level of joint torques with longer-term goal-directed behavior is a long-standing challenge for physically embodied artificial agents. Intelligent behavior in the physical world unfolds across multiple spatial and temporal scales: Although movements are ultimately executed at the level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected to serve goals that are defined on much longer time scales and that often involve complex interactions with the environment and other agents. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of learning-based approaches applied to the respective problems of complex movement, long-term planning, and multiagent coordination. However, their integration traditionally required the design and optimization of independent subsystems and remains challenging. In this work, we tackled the integration of motor control and long-horizon decision-making in the context of simulated humanoid football, which requires agile motor control and multiagent coordination. We optimized teams of agents to play simulated football via reinforcement learning, constraining the solution space to that of plausible movements learned using human motion capture data. They were trained to maximize several environment rewards and to imitate pretrained football-specific skills if doing so led to improved performance. The result is a team of coordinated humanoid football players that exhibit complex behavior at different scales, quantified by a range of analysis and statistics, including those used in real-world sport analytics.

1283,6690109.0,Selective hypercontraction caused by ergonovine in the canine coronary artery under conditions of induced atherosclerosis.,Circulation,"The relationship between the hypercontractile response of the regional coronary artery to ergonovine and induced vascular change after endothelial denudation and a high-cholesterol diet was examined in dogs by arteriographic (in situ) and mechanographic (in vitro) methods. In 15 mongrel dogs, selective endothelial denudation of either the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) or left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was repeated twice 1 month apart by means of coronary arterial catheterization. A high-cholesterol diet (20 g/day) was given thereafter for 3 (n = 15) and 6 (n = 8) months. Although there was no difference in the extent of coronary vasoconstriction between the LAD and LCX before or immediately after endothelial denudation, after intravenous administration of ergonovine a significant augmentation of coronary constriction along the denuded portion was noted arteriographically in the long-term phase (1 to 6 months). At the end of the study in vivo, isometric tension of the strips of the denuded and contralateral intact coronary arteries was measured during the cumulative addition of ergonovine, serotonin, or phenylephrine to the organ bath; agonist responses were standardized by the response to 35 mM KCl. Although the concentration-response relations for phenylephrine (10(-9) M to 10(-5) M) were not significantly different between intact and denuded arteries, responses of the denuded portion to cumulative addition of ergonovine (10(-10) M) or serotonin 10(-9) M to 10(-5) M) exhibited markedly depressed threshold concentrations along with a significantly lowered negative logarithm (pD2) of the dose producing 50% of the maximum effect. The tension developed in the denuded portion was also enhanced over that noted in the contralateral coronary artery during the cumulative addition of ergonovine but not during application of phenylephrine. Thus enhanced constriction documented arteriographically may be derived from the localized hypersensitivity to ergonovine. Microscopically, the endothelial denudation and a long-term high-cholesterol diet resulted in a regional intimal thickening with fibrous proliferation but little lipid deposition. Therefore smooth muscle in atherosclerotic arteries may be hypersensitive to specific agonists such as ergonovine and serotonin in a canine preparation. These results suggest that coronary spasm induced by ergonovine in humans is relevant to the presence of atherosclerotic changes in the vascular wall.",1984,69,2,441-50,10.1161/01.cir.69.2.441,#3968,Kawachi 1984,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 136 patients with MPS (66 men and 70 women). Pain was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Investigation of profiles of natural antibodies (nAbs) to specific opioid peptides (β-endorphin and orphanin), biogenic amines (dopamine and serotonin), surface electromyography (SEMG) of m. errector spinae at the L3-L4 level bilaterally were performed. Measurements were done at 1st, 10th and 21st days of treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in pain intensity (by 71% in men and by 63% in women) accompanied by a decrease in muscle tension by 10-25% in group values of SEMG amplitudes, and by 34-38% as assessed by individual dynamics of SEMG amplitudes. All nAbs levels were elevated or high in the 1st day. The dynamics of nAbs levels was multidirectional. At the 21st day, there was the increase in the incidence of patients with high nAbs levels to opioid peptides (39-41% women and 33-39% men) and patients with normal nAbs levels to serotonin (59% men and 52% women), while the levels of nAbs to dopamine decreased to normal levels in women (56%) and remained elevated (50%) or highly elevated (17%) in men. CONCLUSION: The dynamics of immune indicators correlates with pain intensity that possibly reflects the pathological changes in neural/humoral interactions in chronic pain. In this regard, monitoring of nAbs levels is prognostically relevant for assessment of risk of pain chronification.",2020,120,12,73-79,10.17116/jnevro202012012173,#3969,Levashova 2020,biogenic amines
1285,29370057.0,Analysis of isolated transverse process fractures sustained during blast-related events.,J Trauma Acute Care Surg,"BACKGROUND: Personnel have sustained a range of devastating blast injuries during recent conflicts. Previous studies have focused on severe injuries, including to the spine; however, no study has specifically focused on the most common spinal injury-transverse process (TP) fractures. Although their treatment usually requires limited intervention, analysis of TP fractures may help determine injury mechanisms. METHODS: Data were collected from victims with spinal fractures who were injured in improvised explosive device attacks, from the UK's Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. The level and side of each TP fracture were recorded, as well as associated injuries, whether they were mounted or dismounted, and outcome (survivor or fatality). RESULTS: Most (80%) of the TP fractures were lumbar. More bilateral (both left and right fractures at the same level), and L5 TP fractures, were seen in fatalities than survivors. In the mounted group, lumbar TP fractures were statistically significantly associated with fatality, head injury, noncompressible torso hemorrhage, pelvic injury, and other spinal injuries. In the dismounted group, thoracic TP fractures were associated with head, chest wall, and other spinal injuries; and lumbar TP fractures were associated with pelvic and other spinal injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Different injury mechanisms of the TP in the mounted and dismounted groups are likely. Inertial forces acting within the torso due to rapid loading being transferred through the seat, or high intra-abdominal pressures causing the tensile forces acting through the lumbar fascia to avulse the TPs are likely mechanisms in the mounted group. Blunt trauma, violent lateral flexion-extension forces, or rapid flail of the lower extremities causing tension of the psoas muscle, avulsing the TP, are likely causes in the dismounted group. Isolated lumbar TP fractures can be used as markers for more severe injuries, and fatality, in mounted blast casualties.

1286,24504097.0,Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 activation constricts the human bronchus via the release of cysteinyl leukotrienes.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"Prior studies have demonstrated that the ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is functionally expressed in airway smooth muscle cells and that TRPV4 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We sought to use isometric tension measurements in ex vivo airways to determine whether short-term pharmacological activation of TRPV4 with the potent agonist GSK1016790 [N-((1S)-1-{[4-((2S)-2-{[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)sulfonyl]amino}-3-hydroxypropanoyl)-1-piperazinyl]carbonyl}-3-methylbutyl)-1-benzothiophene-2-carboxamide] would constrict human bronchial tissue. As predicted, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 activation in the human airway produces contractions that are blocked by the nonselective transient receptor potential channel blocker ruthenium red. Moreover, the novel TRPV4-selective blocker GSK2334775 [(R)-6-(methylsulfonyl)-3-((4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)piperindin-1-yl)methyl)-N-(2,2,2,-trifluoro-1-phenylethyl)-2-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)quinoline-4-carboxamide] inhibited these contractions over a concentration range consistent with its in vitro potency against recombinant and native TRPV4-containing channels. Surprisingly, TRPV4-dependent contractions were also blocked by a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor and two structurally distinct cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor antagonists. In aggregate, our results fail to support the hypothesis that TRPV4 in airway smooth muscle cells regulates airway contractility short term. Rather, we provide pharmacological evidence that TRPV4 activation causes human airway constriction that is entirely dependent upon the production of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Together, these data identify a novel mechanism by which TRPV4 activation may contribute to pathologic remodeling and inflammation, in addition to airflow obstruction, in the diseased human respiratory tract.",2014,349,1,118-25,10.1124/jpet.113.210203,#3971,McAlexander 2014,

We established an ovine model of hemorrhagic shock to systematically assess tissue oxygen delivery and repayment of oxygen debt; appropriate outcomes to guide Patient Blood Management. METHODS: Female Dorset-cross sheep were anesthetized, intubated, and subjected to comprehensive macrohemodynamic, regional tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), sublingual capillary imaging, and arterial lactate monitoring confirmed by invasive organ-specific microvascular perfusion, oxygen pressure, and lactate/pyruvate levels in brain, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle. Shock was induced by stepwise withdrawal of venous blood until MAP was 30 mm Hg, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) < 60%, and arterial lactate >4 mM. Resuscitation with PlasmaLyte® was dosed to achieve MAP > 65 mm Hg. RESULTS: Hemorrhage impacted primary outcomes between baseline and development of shock: MAP 89 ± 5 to 31 ± 5 mm Hg (P < 0.01), SvO2 70 ± 7 to 23 ± 8% (P < 0.05), cerebral regional tissue StO2 77 ± 11 to 65 ± 9% (P < 0.01), peripheral muscle StO2 66 ± 8 to 16 ± 9% (P < 0.01), arterial lactate 1.5 ± 1.0 to 5.1 ± 0.8 mM (P < 0.01), and base excess 1.1 ± 2.2 to -3.6 ± 1.7 mM (P < 0.05). Invasive organ-specific monitoring confirmed reduced tissue oxygen delivery; oxygen tension decreased and lactate increased in all tissues, but moderately in brain. Blood volume replacement with PlasmaLyte® improved primary outcome measures toward baseline, confirmed by organ-specific measures, despite hemoglobin reduced from baseline 10.8 ± 1.2 to 5.9 ± 1.1 g/dL post-resuscitation (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Non-invasive measures of tissue oxygen delivery and oxygen debt repayment are suitable outcomes to inform Patient Blood Management of hemorrhagic shock, translatable for pre-clinical assessment of novel resuscitation strategies.",2021,56,6,1080-1091,10.1097/SHK.0000000000001805,#3972,Dyer 2021,

METHODS: The clinical data of 90 neonates with HIE were retrospectively analyzed. According to the treatment methods, the neonates were divided into a routine group, a mild hypothermia group, and a combination group, with 30 cases in each group. The differences in neural function recovery, biochemical indexes, clinical signs recovery, efficacy, and complications were observed in the three groups after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the score of neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA) and level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the combination group were higher than those of the other two groups (P < 0.05). The levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S-100β protein, and plasma neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the combination group were lower than those in the other two groups, and the recovery time of consciousness, muscle tension, and reflex was shorter (P < 0.05). The combination group showed higher total effective rate and lower incidence of complications as compared with the other two groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mild hypothermia therapy combined with GM1 for the treatment of neonatal asphyxia complicated by HIE can promote the recovery of neural function and reduce the incidence of complications in neonates.",2021,2021,,6186011,10.1155/2021/6186011,#3973,Ge 2021,
1289,33880611.0,Respiratory parameters on diagnostic sleep studies predict survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,J Neurol,"OBJECTIVE: In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), respiratory muscle involvement and sleep-disordered breathing relate to worse prognosis. The present study investigated whether respiratory outcomes on first-ever sleep studies predict survival in patients with ALS, specifically taking into account subsequent initiation of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). METHODS: From patients with ALS, baseline sleep study records, transcutaneous capnometry, early morning blood gas analysis, survival data and clinical disease characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were stratified according to whether enduring NIV was consecutively established (""NIV(+)"") or not (""NIV(-)""). RESULTS: Among the study cohort (n = 158, 72 female, 51 with bulbar onset ALS, 105 deceased) sleep-disordered breathing was present at baseline evaluation in 97 patients. Early morning base excess (EMBE) > 2 mmol/l predicted nocturnal hypercapnia. Ninety-five patients were NIV(+) and 63 were NIV(-). Survival from baseline sleep studies was significantly reduced in NIV(-) but not in NIV(+) patients with nocturnal CO(2) tension ≥ 50 mmHg, apnea hypopnea index ≥ 5/h, and EMBE > 2 mmol/l. Hazard ratio for EMBE > 2 mmol/l was increased in NIV(-) patients only, and EMBE independently predicted survival in both NIV(-) and NIV(+) patients. Furthermore, EMBE on baseline sleep studies was the only predictor for survival from symptom onset, and hazard ratio for shorter survival was markedly higher in the NIV(-) than the NIV(+) group (2.85, p = 0.005, vs. 1.71, p = 0.042). INTERPRETATION: In patients with ALS, EMBE > 2 mmol/l predicts nocturnal hypercapnia and shorter survival. Negative effects of sleep-disordered breathing on survival are statistically abolished by sustained NIV.",2021,268,11,4321-4331,10.1007/s00415-021-10563-0,#3974,Engel 2021,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
1290,17686141.0,"Health disparities by occupation, modified by education: a cross-sectional population study.",BMC Public Health,"BACKGROUND: Socio-economic disparities in health status are frequently reported in research. By comparison with education and income, occupational status has been less extensively studied in relation to health status or the occurrence of specific chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate health disparities in the working population based on occupational position and how they were modified by education. METHODS: Our data were derived from the National Survey of General Practice that comprised 104 practices in the Netherlands. 136,189 working people aged 25-64 participated in the study. Occupational position was assessed by the International Socio-Economic Index of occupational position (ISEI). Health outcomes were self-perceived health status and physician-diagnosed diseases. Odds ratios were estimated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The lowest occupational position was observed to be associated with poor health in men (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1,5 to 1.7) and women (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4). The risk of poor health gradually decreased in relation to higher occupational positions. People with the lowest occupational positions were more likely to suffer from depression, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, arthritis, muscle pain, neck and back pain and tension headache, in comparison to people with the highest occupational position (OR 1.2 to 1.6). A lower educational level induced an additional risk of poor health and disease. We found that gender modified the effects on poor health when both occupational position and education were combined in the analysis. CONCLUSION: A low occupational position was consistently associated working people with poor health and physician-diagnosed morbidity. However a low educational level was not. Occupational position and education had a combined effect on self-perceived health, which supports the recent call to improve the conceptual framework of health disparities.",2007,7,,196,10.1186/1471-2458-7-196,#3975,Volkers 2007,
1291,29077897.0,"In vivo oxygen, temperature and pH dynamics in the female reproductive tract and their importance in human conception: a systematic review.",Hum Reprod Update,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in ART, implantation and pregnancy rates per embryo transfer still remain low. IVF laboratories strive to ensure that the process of handling gametes in vitro closely mimics the in vivo environment. However, there remains a lack of knowledge regarding the in vivo regulation and dynamic variation in biophysical parameters such as oxygen concentration, pH and temperature within the reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: To undertake a systematic review of the current understanding of the physico-chemical parameters of oxygen tension (pO2), pH and temperature within the female reproductive tract, and their potential implications in clinical and pathological processes related to fertility and those pertaining to limited reproductive capacity. SEARCH METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Pubmed to identify original and review articles addressing the biophysical parameters (pO2, pH and temperature) in the female reproductive tract of any species. The search included all studies published between 1946 and November 2015. Search terms included 'oxygen', 'pH', 'hydrogen ion concentration', 'acid base' and others terms. We also used special features and truncations to identify synonyms and broaden the search. Studies were excluded if they only assessed embryo culture conditions, fetal acid-base status, oxidative stress, outcomes of pregnancy and measurements of these parameters in non-reproductive organs. OUTCOMES: Our search generated 18 685 records and 60 articles were included. pO2 within the female reproductive tract shows cyclical variation and minute-to-minute oscillations, which may be influenced by uterine contractility, hormones, the autonomic system, cardiac pulsatility, and myometrial and smooth muscle integrity. Fine balanced control of pO2 and avoidance of overwhelming oxidative stress is crucial for embryogenesis and implantation. The pH in the female reproductive tract is graduated, with lowest pH in the vagina (~pH 4.42) increasing toward the Fallopian tubes (FTs) (~pH 7.94), reflecting variation in the site-specific microbiome and acid-base buffering at the tissue/cellular level. The temperature variation in humans is cyclical by day and month. In humans, it is biphasic, increasing in the luteal phase; with the caudal region of the oviduct 1-2 degrees cooler than the cranial portion. Temperature variation is influenced by hormones, density of pelvic/uterine vascular beds and effectiveness of heat exchange locally, crucial for sperm motility and embryo development. We have identified significant deficiencies and inconsistencies in the methods used to assess these biophysical factors within the reproductive tract. We have suggested that the technological solutions including the development of methods and models for real time, in vivo recordings of biophysical parameters. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The notion of 'back to nature' in assisted conception suggested 20 years ago has yet to be translated into clinical practice. While the findings from this systematic review do not provide evidence to change current in vitro protocols, it highlights our current inability to assess the in vivo reproductive tract environment in real time. Data made available through future development of sensing technology in utero may help to provide new insights into how best to optimize the in vitro embryo environment and allow for more precise and personalized fertility treatment.",2018,24,1,15-34,10.1093/humupd/dmx028,#3976,NgKYB 2018,Oxygen
1292,26621359.0,Hypoxic culture conditions induce increased metabolic rate and collagen gene expression in ACL-derived cells.,J Orthop Res,"There has been substantial effort directed toward the application of bone marrow and adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in the regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue. Recently, resident tissue-specific stem cells have been described in a variety of mesenchymal structures including ligament, tendon, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In the current study, we systematically characterize three novel anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-derived cell populations with the potential for ligament regeneration: ligament-forming fibroblasts (LFF: CD146(neg) , CD34(neg) CD44(pos) , CD31(neg) , CD45(neg) ), ligament perivascular cells (LPC: CD146(pos) CD34(neg) CD44(pos) , CD31(neg) , CD45(neg) ) and ligament interstitial cells (LIC: CD34(pos) CD146(neg) , CD44(pos) , CD31(neg) , CD45(neg) )-and describe their proliferative and differentiation potential, collagen gene expression and metabolism in both normoxic and hypoxic environments, and their trophic potential in vitro. All three groups of cells (LIC, LPC, and LFF) isolated from adult human ACL exhibited progenitor cell characteristics with regard to proliferation and differentiation potential in vitro. Culture in low oxygen tension enhanced the collagen I and III gene expression in LICs (by 2.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively) and LFFs (by 3- and 3.5-fold, respectively) and increased oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate in LICs (by 4- and 3.5-fold, respectively), LFFs (by 5.5- and 3-fold, respectively), LPCs (by 10- and 4.5-fold, respectively) as compared to normal oxygen concentration. In summary, this study demonstrates for the first time the presence of three novel progenitor cell populations in the adult ACL that demonstrate robust proliferative and matrix synthetic capacity; these cells may play a role in local ligament regeneration, and consequently represent a potential cell source for ligament engineering applications. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

1293,21154345.0,Interventions for treating proximal humeral fractures in adults.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"BACKGROUND: Proximal humeral fractures are common injuries. The management, including surgical intervention, of these fractures varies widely. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence supporting the various treatment and rehabilitation interventions for proximal humeral fractures. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, and bibliographies of trial reports. The full search ended in March 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials pertinent to the management of proximal humeral fractures in adults were selected. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two people performed independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Trial heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen small randomised trials with 801 participants were included. Bias in these trials could not be ruled out.Eight trials evaluated conservative treatment. One trial found an arm sling was generally more comfortable than a less commonly used body bandage. There was some evidence that 'immediate' physiotherapy compared with that delayed until after three weeks of immobilisation resulted in less pain and potentially better recovery in people with undisplaced or other stable fractures. Similarly, there was evidence that mobilisation at one week instead of three weeks alleviated short term pain without compromising long term outcome. Two trials provided some evidence that unsupervised patients could generally achieve a satisfactory outcome when given sufficient instruction for an adequate physiotherapy programme.Surgery improved fracture alignment in two trials but was associated with more complications in one trial, and did not result in improved shoulder function. Preliminary data from another trial showed no significant difference in complications, quality of life or costs between plate fixation and conservative treatment. In one trial, hemiarthroplasty resulted in better short-term function with less pain and disability when compared with conservative treatment for severe injuries.Compared with hemiarthroplasty, tension-band fixation of severe injuries using wires was associated with a high re-operation rate in one trial. One trial found better functional results for one type of hemiarthroplasty.Very limited evidence suggested similar outcomes from early versus later mobilisation after either surgical fixation (one trial) or hemiarthroplasty (one trial). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to inform the management of these fractures. Early physiotherapy, without immobilisation, may be sufficient for some types of undisplaced fractures. It is unclear whether surgery, even for specific fracture types, will produce consistently better long term outcomes.",2010,,12,CD000434,10.1002/14651858.CD000434.pub2,#3978,Handoll 2010,

The aim of this prospective study was to assess the occurrence and change of prevalence in the number of pain sites. We also wanted to identify work-related and individual risk factors associated with the number of musculoskeletal pain sites. METHODS: We monitored musculoskeletal pain from 4 body regions, individual and work-related factors on 21 occasions over a 6.5 year period. The cohort consisted of 420 technical school students entering working life. Data were analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE). RESULTS: Pain from more than one body site was prevalent in this cohort of young adults (69 % at baseline), and the number of body sites in pain was found quite stable over the 6.5 year follow-up period. Women had higher number of pain sites compared with men and gender specific risk factors were identified. Increased mechanical workload and quantitative demands and low socioeconomic status were associated with increased number of musculoskeletal pain sites among women, while tobacco use was found as a risk factor among young men. Increased perceived muscle tension was the only factor significantly associated with increased number of pain sites in both genders. CONCLUSION: The current study supports earlier findings and show that pain from multiple body sites are frequent also among young workers. The identification of gender specific risk factors in our study is important and may facilitate practical prevention and future research.",2016,17,,82,10.1186/s12891-016-0938-6,#3979,Hanvold 2016,

It has a negative impact on health-related quality of life and work productivity and it is associated with increased psychological distress and mental comorbidity, like major depression disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. Due to biopsychosocial factors and the brain-gut axis playing a key role in the aetiology of the disease, the use of psychological treatments has great importance in the therapy of irritable bowel syndrome. These interventions focus on central mechanisms, like visceral sensitivity, pain amplification, hypervigilance and gastrointestinal symptom-specific anxiety. They significantly reduce damaging illness-related cognitions, the use of maladaptive coping strategies, catastrophic appraisals of bodily sensations and chronic muscle tension. The utilization of these treatments is associated with clinically significant symptom improvement and positive mental health outcomes. This review study focuses on the psychiatric comorbidity of irritable bowel syndrome and the use of evidence-based psychological therapies in the treatment of the disease. Using ScienceDirect and PubMed databases, almost 60 studies have been selected. A high number of studies investigate the efficacy of cognitive behaviour therapy and hypnotherapy with meta-analyses included.

1296,9368100.0,Molecular characterization of the murine Hif-1 alpha locus.,Gene Expr,"Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) transcription factor that mediates certain cellular responses to low oxygen tension, iron chelators, Co2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, and low intracellular glucose concentration. Upon exposure to the above conditions, HIF-1 alpha is upregulated and heterodimerizes with the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT, also known as HIF-1 beta), the heterodimeric complex binds TACGTG-containing genomic enhancer elements, and activates transcription of target genes. As a first step in developing genetic models to study the biology related to cellular hypoxia, we have cloned the murine HIF-1 alpha cDNA, determined the tissue-specific expression of its mRNA, functionally analyzed its protein product, and characterized its promoter and its genomic structure. A comparison between the murine and human HIF-1 alpha protein sequence reveals 95%, 99%, and 83% identity in the bHLH, PAS, and variable domains, respectively. RNAse protection assays demonstrate that in adult mice, the mHIF-1 alpha mRNA is expressed at high levels in kidney, heart, brain, thymus, and placenta, with moderate expression in liver, spleen, testis, and lung and much lower expression in skeletal muscle testis. Northern blot analysis indicates that the mRNA of the murine HIF-1 alpha is transcribed in two forms, a major 4-kb species and a minor 5-kb species; both are present in all tissues examined. The Hif-1 alpha promoter is GC rich, does not have a TATA element near its transcriptional start site, and does not respond to hypoxia or Co2+. The mHIF-1 alpha structural gene is composed of 15 exons. The splice junction sites within the bHLH and the PAS domains of HIF-1 alpha gene are highly conserved with respect to a number of previously characterized members of the bHLH-PAS superfamily. However, unlike other bHLH-PAS genes, where the variable domain is encoded by 2 exons, the variable region of the mHIF-1 alpha gene is encoded by 7 exons. Furthermore, most of these splice junction sites in the variable region are conserved with that of HIF-2 alpha, a recently cloned hypoxia-responsive bHLH-PAS protein (also known as MOP2, EPAS1, and HLF). These data suggest that HIF-1 alpha, along with HIF-2 alpha, represents a new subclass of the bHLH-PAS superfamily.",1997,6,5,287-99,,#3981,Luo 1997,
1297,21795434.0,Bromoenol lactone inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ and transient receptor potential canonical channels.,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,"Circulating hormones stimulate the phospholipase Cβ (PLC)/Ca(2+) influx pathway to regulate numerous cell functions, including vascular tone. It was proposed previously that Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2))-dependent store-operated Ca(2+) influx channels mediate hormone-induced contractions in isolated arteries, because bromoenol lactone (BEL), a potent irreversible inhibitor of iPLA(2), inhibited such contractions. However, the effects of BEL on other channels implicated in mediating hormone-induced vessel contractions, specifically voltage-gated Ca(2+) (Ca(V)1.2) and transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, have not been defined clearly. Using isometric tension measurements, we found that thapsigargin-induced contractions were ∼34% of those evoked by phenylephrine or KCl. BEL completely inhibited not only thapsigargin- but also phenylephrine- and KCl-induced ring contractions, suggesting that Ca(V)1.2 and receptor-operated TRPC channels also may be sensitive to BEL. Therefore, we investigated the effects of BEL on heterologously expressed Ca(V)1.2 and TRPC channels in human embryonic kidney cells, a model system that allows probing of individual protein function without interference from other signaling elements of native cells. We found that low micromolar concentrations of BEL inhibited Ca(V)1.2, TRPC5, TRPC6, and heteromeric TRPC1-TRPC5 channels in an iPLA(2)-independent manner. BEL also attenuated PLC activity, suggesting that the compound may inhibit TRPC channel activity in part by interfering with an initial PLC-dependent step required for TRPC channel activation. Conversely, BEL did not affect endogenous voltage-gated K(+) channels in human embryonic kidney cells.

Methods: A case-control design was employed to recruit 32 women (n = 17 SARS-CoV-2; n = 15 controls) matched on age (54 ± 12 years) and body mass index (27 ± 6 kg/m(2)) that did not differ by smoking status or history of cardiopulmonary disease. Participants completed a series of assessments including Profile of Mood States (POMS), Modified Pulmonary Functional Status and Dyspnea Questionnaire (PFSDQ-M), and Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time PA. Results: Significant between-group differences were detected for the POMS total mood disturbance with sub-scale analyses revealing elevated tension, confusion, and lower vigor among SARS-CoV-2 participants (all p-values < 0.05). The number of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms (e.g., loss of taste/smell, muscle aches etc.) were associated (r = 0.620, p = 0.008) with confusion. SARS-CoV-2 participants exhibited poorer functional status (p = 0.008) and reduced leisure-time PA (p = 0.004) compared to controls. Conclusion: The sequela of persistent SARS-CoV-2 symptoms elicit clear disturbances in functional status, mood state, and leisure-time PA among women with PASC.

Patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors.",Anesthesiology,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have noted a high incidence of adverse outcomes in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), but few have examined associated factors and patient outcomes. To determine the frequency of acute, unanticipated respiratory problems and to examine the associated patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors, we prospectively collected preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data on 24,157 consecutive PACU patients who received a general anesthetic during a 33-month period. METHODS: A PACU critical respiratory event (CRE), was defined as any unanticipated hypoxemia (hemoglobin oxygen saturation < 90%), hypoventilation (respiratory rate < 8 breaths/min or arterial carbon dioxide tension > 50 mmHg) or upper-airway obstruction (stridor or laryngospasm) requiring an active and specific intervention (ventilation, tracheal intubation, opioid or muscle relaxant antagonism, insertion of oral/nasal airway or airway manipulation). These problems were documented by PACU nurses whereas data on case-mix, surgical factors, and intraoperative management were retrieved from the anesthetic record. Significant patient, surgical, and anesthetic factors were identified by logistic regression analysis. Other morbidity experienced by patients with a CRE was also noted. RESULTS: For patients given general anesthesia the risk of a CRE was 1.3% (hypoxemia 0.9%, hypoventilation 0.2%, airway obstruction 0.2%). Preoperative factors that increase risk were age > 60 yr, male gender, diabetes, and obesity (P < 0.05). Patients who underwent operative procedures on an emergency basis and whose operation was longer than 4 h were also at increased risk, but those undergoing perineal procedures were at lower risk (P < 0.05). Anesthetic risk factors (P < 0.05) included opioid premedication (relative odds 1.8), sedatives preoperatively (2.0), fentanyl > 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 as the sole opioid (1.9), fentanyl used in combination with morphine (1.6) and atracurium > or = 0.25 mg.kg-1.h-1 (2.2). Patients in whom anesthesia was induced with thiopental (relative odds 2.5), compared with those who received propofol for induction, were also at increased risk of a CRE. Patients with a CRE stayed longer in PACU, had higher rates of unanticipated admissions to the intensive care unit and were more likely to have PACU cardiac problems (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A CRE is relatively rare. Multiple patient and surgical factors and specific aspects of anesthetic management are associated with the occurrence of a CRE in the PACU.",1994,81,2,410-8,10.1097/00000542-199408000-00020,#3984,Rose 1994,
1300,29045952.0,[Progress in diagnosis and management of syncope in children].,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,"Syncope is a common emergency of children and adolescents, which has serious influence on the quality of life. Neurally-mediated syncope, including postural tachycardia syndrome, vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic hypertension, is the main cause of syncope in children and adolescents. The main manifestations of neurally-mediated syncope are diverse, such as dizziness, headache, chest tightness, chest pain, pale complexion, fatigue, pre-syncope and syncope. Although the clinical manifestations are similar, each subtype of syncope has its hemodynamic feature and optimal treatment option. The diagnosis rate of syncope in children has been greatly improved on account of the development of the diagnostic procedures and methods. In recent years, with the promotion of head-up tilt test and drug-provocated head-up tilt test, the hemodynamic classification of neurally-mediated syncope gets continually refined. In recent years, with the effort of clinicians, an appropriate diagnostic protocol for children with syncope has been established. The initial evaluation consists of history taking, physical examination, standing test and standard electrocardiography. After the initial evaluation, some patients could be diagnosed definitely, such as postural tachycardia syndrome, orthostatic hypotension, and situational syncope. Those with a specific entity causing syncope need selective clinical and laboratory investigations. Patients for whom the cause of syncope remained undetermined should undergo head-up tilt test. The precise pathogenesis of neurally-mediated syncope is not entirely clear. In recent years, studies have shown that neurally-mediated syncope may be related to several factors, including hypovolemia, high catecholamine status, abnormal local vascular tension, decreased skeletal muscle pump activity and abnormal neurohumoral factors. Currently based on the possible pathogenesis, the individualized treatment of neurally-mediated syncope has also been studied in-depth. Generally, the management of neurally-mediated syncope includes non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Patient education is the fundamental part above all. In addition to exercise training, the first-line treatments mainly include oral rehydration salts, beta adrenoreceptor blockers, and alpha adrenoreceptor agonists. By analyzing the patient's physiological indexes and biomarkers before treatment, the efficacy of medication could be well predicted. The individualized treatment will become the main direction in the future researches.",2017,49,5,756-759,,#3985,Xu 2017,
1301,34183711.0,In vivo loading on the hip joint in patients with total hip replacement performing gymnastics and aerobics exercises.,Sci Rep,"A further increase in the number of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is predicted, in particular the number of young THA patients has raised and with it their demands. There is no standardized evidence-based rehabilitation program and no reliable guidelines for sports activities after THA. Stretching and strengthening gymnastics are routinely performed in rehabilitation and aerobics as a sport after THA. The aim of the investigation was to determine the in vivo force and moments acting on the hip prosthesis during gymnastics and aerobic exercises to provide a source for evidence-based recommendations. Hip joint loads were measured in six patients with instrumented hip implants. The resulting force F(Res), bending moment M(Bend) at the neck and torsional moment M(Tors) at the stem were examined during seven strengthening (with two different resistance bands) and four stretching gymnastic exercises and seven aerobic exercises with and without an aerobic step board compared to the loads during the reference activity walking. The stretching and strengthening gymnastics exercises and the aerobic exercises with and without a board demonstrated in their median peak force and moments mostly lower or similar values compared to walking. Significantly increased loads were recorded for the flexor stretching exercise in monopod stand (F(res) and M(Bend)), the strengthening abduction exercise on the chair (M(Tors)) and the strengthening flexion exercise with the stronger resistance band (M(Tors)). We also found a significant increase in median peak values in aerobic exercises with a board for the ""Basic Step"" (ipsilateral started F(res) and M(Tors); contralateral started M(Tors)), ""Kickstep ipsilateral started"" (F(res) and M(Tors)) and ""Over the Top contralateral started"" (F(res)). The in vivo loads in THA patients during frequently performed stretching, strengthening and aerobic exercises were demonstrated for the first time. It was proved that stretching gymnastic exercises are safe in terms of resulting force, bending and torque moments for THA patients, although an external assistance for stabilization may be considered. Strengthening gymnastics exercises are reliable in terms of F(res), M(Bend) and M(Tors), but, based on our data, we recommend to adhere to the communicated specific postoperative restrictions and select the resistance bands with lower tension. Aerobic exercises without an aerobic board can be considered as reliable activity in terms of force and moments for THA patients. Aerobic exercises with a board are not recommended for the early postoperative period and in our opinion need to be adapted to the individual muscular and coordinative resources.",2021,11,1,13395,10.1038/s41598-021-92788-7,#3986,Haffer 2021,
1302,32755502.0,Glottal Aerodynamics Estimated From Neck-Surface Vibration in Women With Phonotraumatic and Nonphonotraumatic Vocal Hyperfunction.,J Speech Lang Hear Res,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine whether estimates of glottal aerodynamic measures based on neck-surface vibration are comparable to those previously obtained using oral airflow and air pressure signals (Espinoza et al., 2017) in terms of discriminating patients with phonotraumatic and nonphonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction (PVH and NPVH) from vocally healthy controls. Method Consecutive /pae/ syllables at comfortable and loud level were produced by 16 women with PVH (organic vocal fold lesions), 16 women with NPVH (primary muscle tension dysphonia), and 32 vocally healthy women who were each matched to a patient according to age and occupation. Subglottal impedance-based inverse filtering of the anterior neck-surface accelerometer (ACC) signal yielded estimates of peak-to-peak glottal airflow, open quotient, and maximum flow declination rate. Average subglottal pressure and microphone-based sound pressure level (SPL) were also estimated from the ACC signal using subject-specific linear regression models. The ACC-based measures of glottal aerodynamics were normalized for SPL and statistically compared between each patient and matched-control group. Results Patients with PVH and NPVH exhibited lower SPL-normalized glottal aerodynamics values than their respective control subjects (p values ranging from < .01 to .07) with very large effect sizes (1.04-2.16), regardless of loudness condition or measurement method (i.e., ACC-based values maintained discriminatory power). Conclusions The results of this study demonstrate that ACC-based estimates of most glottal aerodynamic measures are comparable to those previously obtained from oral airflow and air pressure (Espinoza et al., 2017) in terms of differentiating between hyperfunctional (PVH and NPVH) and normal vocal function. ACC-based estimates of glottal aerodynamic measures may be used to assess vocal function during continuous speech and enables this assessment of daily voice use during ambulatory monitoring to provide better insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with vocal hyperfunction.",2020,63,9,2861-2869,10.1044/2020_JSLHR-20-00189,#3987,Espinoza 2020,
1303,9064969.0,[Cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormones].,Z Kardiol,"The heart is a major target organ for thyroid hormone action, and marked changes occur in cardiac function in patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Triiodothyronine (T3)-induced changes in cardiac function can result from direct or indirect T3 effects. Direct T3 effects result from T3 action in the heart itself and are mediated by nuclear or extranuclear mechanisms. Extranuclear T3 effects, which occur independently of nuclear T3 receptor binding and increases in protein synthesis, influence primarily the transport of amino acids, sugars, and calcium across the cell membrane. Nuclear T3 effects are mediated by the binding of T3 to specific nuclear receptor proteins, which results in increased transcription of T3-responsive cardiac genes. The T3 receptor is a member of the ligand-activated transcription factor family and is encoded by cellular erythroblastosis A (c-erb A) genes. T3 increases the heart transcription of the myosin heavy chain (MHC) alpha gene and decreases the transcription of the MHC beta gene, leading to an increase of myosin V1 and a decrease in myosin V3 isoenzymes. Myosin V1, which is composed of two MHC alpha, has a higher myosin ATPase activity than myosin V3, which contains two MHC beta. The globular head of myosin V1, with its higher ATPase activity, leads to a more rapid movement of the globular head of myosin along the thin filament, resulting in an increased velocity of contraction. T3 also leads to an increase in the speed of diastolic relaxation, which is caused by the more efficient pumping of the calcium ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This T3 effect results from T3-induced increases in the level of the mRNA coding for the SR calcium ATPase protein, leading to an increased number of calcium ATPase pump units in the SR. Overall, T3 leads to an increase in ATP consumption in the heart. In addition, less chemical energy of ATP is used for contractile purposes and more of it goes toward heat production, which causes a decreased efficiency of the contractile process in the hyperthyroid heart. The pathophysiologic basis for myxedema is the opposite of that discussed for the hyperthyroid heart. In addition to decreased direct effects of thyroid hormone in cardiac myocytes, indirect effects occur through decreases in peripheral oxygen consumption and changes in hemodynamic parameters. Myofibrillar swelling with loss of striation and interstitial fibrosis occurs on histologic examination of hypothyroid hearts. In addition, accumulation of mucopolysaccharide substances (Glycosaminoglycans) can be demonstrated. On electron microscopic examination, mitochondria show disruption and lipid inclusion. Cardiac papillary muscle obtained from animals with hypothyroidism shows a depression of the force velocity curve and reduced rate of tension development, indicating significant contractile abnormalities. In patients with hypothyroidism, a true enhanced incidence of hypertension (increased peripheral vascular resistance) has been found. In addition, hypercholesterolemia and impairment of fatty acid mobilization are associated with myxedema and present additional risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",1996,85 Suppl 6,,219-31,,#3988,Mohr-Kahaly 1996,

METHODS: One hundred and fifteen female patients randomized to OBT (N = 43), CBT (N = 42), or whole-body infrared heat (IH) (N = 30) were compared before and after group treatment as well as at 6- and 12-month follow-ups using intent-to-treat analysis (12 drop-outs). Thirty matched pain-free controls (CON) served as reference group for the initial psychophysiological analysis. Surface electromyogram (EMG), blood pressure, heart rate (HR) and skin conductance levels (SCL) were continuously recorded during adaptation, baseline, social conflict, mental arithmetic and relaxation tasks. RESULTS: At baseline, fibromyalgia patients showed higher SCL and HR, lower diastolic blood pressure and EMG in comparison to controls. OBT and CBT compared to IH significantly reduced pain intensity [OBT: effect size (ES) = 1.21 CI: 0.71-1.71, CBT: ES = 1.23, CI: 0.72-1.74]. OBT increased diastolic blood pressure [ES = 1.13, CI: 0.63-1.63 and CBT reduced SCL (ES) = -0.66, CI: -1.14-0.18] 12 months after treatment. Both CBT and OBT significantly increased EMG levels (OBT: ES = 0.97, CI: 0.48-1.46, CBT: ES = 1.17, CI: 0.67-1.68). In contrast, the IH group did not show any significant changes in the psychophysiological parameters. CONCLUSION: Increased diastolic blood pressure and decreased pain after OBT suggest a reactivation of baroreflex-mechanisms in fibromyalgia and a normalization of the blood pressure and pain functional relationship. Reduced SCL following CBT may indicate reduced general arousal levels. Increased muscle tension after CBT and OBT suggest a normalization of physical parameters. The reduction in pain seems to be mediated by different psychophysiological processes, providing support for mechanism-based treatments might be indicated for CBT and OBT. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: Differential physiological stress responses followed different psychological interventions. While OBT influenced blood pressure by restoring blood pressure-pain interaction, CBT reduced stress-related sudomotor activity. These results implicate specific mediating mechanisms in fibromyalgia suggesting a basis for matching based on specific patient psychophysiological features.",2016,20,9,1478-89,10.1002/ejp.872,#3989,Thieme 2016,
1305,29238948.0,Antioxidants for preventing and reducing muscle soreness after exercise.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"BACKGROUND: Muscle soreness typically occurs after intense exercise, unaccustomed exercise or actions that involve eccentric contractions where the muscle lengthens while under tension. It peaks between 24 and 72 hours after the initial bout of exercise. Many people take antioxidant supplements or antioxidant-enriched foods before and after exercise in the belief that these will prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidant supplements and antioxidant-enriched foods for preventing and reducing the severity and duration of delayed onset muscle soreness following exercise. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, SPORTDiscus, trial registers, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings up to February 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of all forms of antioxidant supplementation including specific antioxidant supplements (e.g. tablets, powders, concentrates) and antioxidant-enriched foods or diets on preventing or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). We excluded studies where antioxidant supplementation was combined with another supplement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included trials using a pre-piloted form. Where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials, generally using the random-effects model. The outcomes selected for presentation in the 'Summary of findings' table were muscle soreness, collected at times up to 6 hours, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-exercise, subjective recovery and adverse effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty randomised, placebo-controlled trials were included, 12 of which used a cross-over design. Of the 1089 participants, 961 (88.2%) were male and 128 (11.8%) were female. The age range for participants was between 16 and 55 years and training status varied from sedentary to moderately trained. The trials were heterogeneous, including the timing (pre-exercise or post-exercise), frequency, dose, duration and type of antioxidant supplementation, and the type of preceding exercise. All studies used an antioxidant dosage higher than the recommended daily amount. The majority of trials (47) had design features that carried a high risk of bias due to selective reporting and poorly described allocation concealment, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings.We tested only one comparison: antioxidant supplements versus control (placebo). No studies compared high-dose versus low-dose, where the low-dose supplementation was within normal or recommended levels for the antioxidant involved.Pooled results for muscle soreness indicated a small difference in favour of antioxidant supplementation after DOMS-inducing exercise at all main follow-ups: up to 6 hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.04; 525 participants, 21 studies; low-quality evidence); at 24 hours (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.00; 936 participants, 41 studies; moderate-quality evidence); at 48 hours (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.07; 1047 participants, 45 studies; low-quality evidence); at 72 hours (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.00; 657 participants, 28 studies; moderate-quality evidence), and little difference at 96 hours (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.19; 436 participants, 17 studies; low-quality evidence). When we rescaled to a 0 to 10 cm scale in order to quantify the actual difference between groups, we found that the 95% CIs for all five follow-up times were all well below the minimal important difference of 1.4 cm: up to 6 hours (MD -0.52, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.08); at 24 hours (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.07); at 48 hours (MD -0.41, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.12); at 72 hours (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.02); and at 96 hours (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.37). Thus, the effect sizes suggesting less muscle soreness with antioxidant supplementation were very unlikely to equate to meaningful or important differences in practice. Neither of our subgroup analyses to examine for differences in effect according to type of DOMS-inducing exercise (mechanical versus whole body aerobic) or according to funding source confirmed subgroup differences. Sensitivity analyses excluding cross-over trials showed that their inclusion had no important impact on results.None of the 50 included trials measured subjective recovery (return to previous activities without signs or symptoms).There is very little evidence regarding the potential adverse effects of taking antioxidant supplements as this outcome was reported in only nine trials (216 participants). From the studies that did report adverse effects, two of the nine trials found adverse effects. All six participants in the antioxidant group of one trial had diarrhoea and four of these also had mild indigestion; these are well-known side effects of the particular antioxidant used in this trial. One of 26 participants in a second trial had mild gastrointestinal distress. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate to low-quality evidence that high dose antioxidant supplementation does not result in a clinically relevant reduction of muscle soreness after exercise at up to 6 hours or at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exercise. There is no evidence available on subjective recovery and only limited evidence on the adverse effects of taking antioxidant supplements. The findings of, and messages from, this review provide an opportunity for researchers and other stakeholders to come together and consider what are the priorities, and underlying justifications, for future research in this area.",2017,12,12,CD009789,10.1002/14651858.CD009789.pub2,#3990,Ranchordas 2017,
1306,19251875.0,Anger management style moderates effects of attention strategy during acute pain induction on physiological responses to subsequent mental stress and recovery: a comparison of chronic pain patients and healthy nonpatients.,Psychosom Med,"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether high trait anger-out chronic low back (CLBP) patients would show exceptionally large symptom-specific lower paraspinal (LP) responses, compared with healthy nonpatients, during pain induction, a subsequent mental stressor, and recovery when they were urged to suppress awareness of pain and suffering. METHODS: CLBP patients (n = 93) and nonpatients (n = 105) were assigned randomly to one of four attention strategy conditions for use during pain induction: sensory-focus, distraction, suppression, or control. All participants underwent a cold pressor, and then performed mental arithmetic. They completed the anger-out (AOS) and anger-in (AIS) subscales of the Anger Expression Inventory. RESULTS: General Linear Model procedures were used to test Attention Strategy Condition x Patient/Nonpatient Status x AOS (or AIS) x Period interactions for physiological indices. Significant interactions were found such that: a) high trait anger-out patients in the Suppression condition seemed to show the greatest LP reactivity during the mental arithmetic followed by the slowest recovery compared with other conditions; b) high trait anger-out patients and nonpatients in the Suppression condition seemed to show the slowest systolic blood pressure recoveries compared with other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Results extend previous work by suggesting that an anger-out style moderates effects of how attention is allocated during pain on responses to and recovery from a subsequent mental stressor. Results provide further evidence that trait anger-out and trait anger-in among CLBP patients are associated with increased LP muscle tension during and after pain and mental stress.",2009,71,4,454-62,10.1097/PSY.0b013e318199d97f,#3991,Burns 2009,

The secondary aims were to evaluate the frequency of an incorrect diagnosis of ""cervical arthrosis"" in patients unaware of having migraine and to compare the clinical features, diagnostic investigation, and treatment strategies between the 2 subgroups of migraineurs, that is, those with and without the incorrect diagnosis of ""cervical arthrosis."" METHODS: Patients, between 18 and 65 years, were consecutively referred to 5 Headache Centers in 2 Italian regions for a first visit. They fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine (with/without aura, episodic/chronic) and were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Each patient underwent a specific cranial/cervical musculoskeletal clinical examination. RESULTS: A total of 117/250 subjects (46.8%) were unaware that they suffered from migraine. In these unaware subjects, the most frequently reported diagnosis was ""cervical arthrosis"" in 34/117 (29.1%), followed by tension-type headache in 23/117 (19%). The cervical region was the most common site of pain onset in the so-called ""cervical arthrosis"" group (52.9%, P < .0001), where also more pericranial (58.8%; P = .041) and neck (70.6%; P = .009) muscle tenderness, restricted range of cervical vertical (47.1%; P < .001), and lateral (29.4%; P = .040) movements were reported. More ""cervical arthrosis patients"" had been referred to an Emergency Department (88.2%; P = .011) and had undergone more cervical spine radiography (23.5%; P = .003) and magnetic resonance imaging (20.6%; P = .044). While they had used fewer triptans (11.8%; P = .007) and received less pharmacological prophylaxis (2.9%; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: In our sample, there were high misdiagnosis rates for migraine sufferers in Italy. The most common misdiagnosis, that is, ""cervical arthrosis,"" led to misuse of healthcare facilities and had a negative impact on the migraine treatment.",2020,60,1,81-89,10.1111/head.13679,#3992,Rota 2020,headache
1308,28223136.0,Wnt3α and transforming growth factor-β induce myofibroblast differentiation from periodontal ligament cells via different pathways.,Exp Cell Res,"Myofibroblasts are specialized cells that play a key role in connective tissue remodeling and reconstruction. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), vimentin and tenascin-C are myofibroblast phenotype, while α-SMA is the phenotypic marker. The observation that human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) differentiate into myofibroblasts under orthodontic force has provided a new perspective for understanding of the biological and biomechanical mechanisms involved in orthodontic tooth movement. However, the cell-specific molecular mechanisms leading to myofibroblast differentiation in the periodontal ligament (PDL) remain unclear. In this study, we found that expression of Wnt3α, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), α-SMA and tenascin-C increased in both tension and compression regions of the PDL under orthodontic load compared with unloaded control, suggesting that upregulated Wnt3α and TGF-β1 signaling might have roles in myofibroblast differentiation in response to orthodontic force. We reveal in vitro that both Wnt3α and TGF-β1 promote myofibroblast differentiation from hPDLCs. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) impairs Wnt3α-induced myofibroblast differentiation in a β-catenin-dependent manner. TGF-β1 stimulates myofibroblast differentiation via a JNK-dependent mechanism.

1309,10668665.0,Supraglottic activity: evidence of vocal hyperfunction or laryngeal articulation?,J Speech Lang Hear Res,"False vocal fold (FVF) adduction and compression of the arytenoid cartilages to the petiole of the epiglottis in an anterior to posterior (A-P) direction have been thought to characterize voice disorders with abnormally increased muscle tension or effort, often termed hyperfunctional voice disorders. To further evaluate the association between hyperfunctional voice disorders and supraglottic activity, we compared the incidence of static and dynamic supraglottic activity in individuals with normal laryngeal mucosa, normal voice quality, and no voice complaints to two populations: subjects with vocal fold nodules and subjects with complaints of dysphonia without visible vocal fold lesions, glottal incompetence, or impairment of arytenoid cartilage motion (""hyperfunctional"" group). Thirty-two subjects were assigned to one of these three groups (10 control, 12 nodule, and 10 hyperfunctional). Laryngeal movements were recorded using flexible videoendoscopy while a subject was performing speech tasks such as sustained phonation, syllable repetitions, sentence imitations, and conversation. Samples were randomized by subject and task and rated for presence or absence of A-P and FVF compression. Statistically significant group differences were found for FVF compression across speech tasks (chi-square, p<0.001). The control group had the smallest incidence (45%), nodule patients the next larger incidence (68%), and hyperfunctional patients the largest incidence (80%). Statistically significant group differences were found for A-P compression across speech tasks (chi-square, p<.05). The control group had the smallest incidence (74%), nodule patients the next larger incidence (78%), and hyperfunctional patients the largest incidence (92%). Statistically significant task differences were found for the presence of FVF compression in control subjects (chi-square, p<.005), hyperfunctional patients (chi-square, p<.025), and nodule patients (chi-square, p<.001), but not for A-P compression for any of the groups. A higher incidence of FVF compression was present for the speech tasks that included glottal stops. This context-specific variation in supraglottic activity suggested a dynamic component to FVF compression and also explained the high proportion of FVF compression in the control group. Each video sample was also rated for consistency of FVF or A-P compression to explore the static and dynamic nature of supraglottic activity. For samples on which raters agreed, A-P compression was typically present consistently, suggesting a static component, and FVF compression inconsistently, suggesting a dynamic component, for all three groups (chi-square, p<.001). These findings do not support previous suggestions that supraglottic activity may be a precursor to developing vocal fold nodules, as the nodule patients did not exhibit a higher incidence or consistency of A-P or FVF compression than patients with hyperfunctional voicing patterns in this study. Subjects in the hyperfunctional voice group were found to have static components of FVF and A-P compression. The presence of FVF compression in speech tasks that included glottal stops in the control group suggests an articulatory function at the laryngeal level.",2000,43,1,229-38,10.1044/jslhr.4301.229,#3994,Stager 2000,
1310,34767467.0,COMET - effectiveness and tolerability of methocarbamol versus oral opioid-analgesics as add-on measure in patients with non-specific low back pain refractory to recommended 1st line treatments. A retrospective analysis of depersonalized propensity score ,Curr Med Res Opin,"BACKGROUND: To compare the 4-week effectiveness and tolerability of an add-on treatment with oral high dose methocarbamol (MET) vs long-acting oral opioid analgesics (LAO) in patients with non-specific low back pain (nsLBP) poorly responsive to recommended 1st line treatments. METHODS: Analysis of anonymized, propensity score-matched real-world data from the German Pain e-Registry, using a sequential non-inferiority superiority approach, for adult outpatients with nsLBP who had initiated treatment with MET or LAO between 1st January 2018 and 31st December 2019 (EUPAS identifier: 38484). The primary effectiveness variable was the absolute change of the average 24-h. pain intensity index (PIX). Safety was assessed by incidence of physician-confirmed drug-related adverse events (DRAEs), and DRAEs leading to discontinuation. RESULTS: Propensity score-matched data were analyzed for 374 patients treated with MET and 374 patients treated with LAO. Mean ± SD (median) MET dose over the 4-week evaluation period was 2390.4 ± 1980 (3000) mg and 69.6 ± 25.9 (60) mg morphine equivalent for LAO. With 25.8 ± 11.4 (median 26, 95%CI: 24.5-27.1) vs. 11.4 ± 6.8 (median 11; 95%CI: 10.6-12.2) mm VAS, absolute 4-week improvement vs. baseline was superior for MET vs. LAO [p < .001; effect size 1.6; least square mean difference 14.4 (95%CI: 13.4-15.3)]. Percentages of patients with a PIX improvement ≥ MCID was 81.8 vs. 24.6% [p < .001; OR: 13.8 (9.7-19.6), RR: 4.0 (3.2-5.0), NNT: 1.7]. A significantly lower number of patients treated with MET vs. LAO reported DRAEs in response to study medication: 36 (9.6%) vs. 139 (37.2%; p < .001; NNT 4), and 9 patients treated with MET (2.4%) vs. 86 (23.0%) treated with LAO discontinued treatment in response to these DRAEs (p < .001; NNT: 5). CONCLUSION: 4-week add-on treatment with MET in patients with nsLBP who showed an inadequate response to recommended 1(st) line treatments is superior effective to LAO and significantly better tolerated.KEY MESSAGESLow back pain is the most common musculoskeletal problem worldwide.In the majority of patients, LBP does not have a specific cause and the most prevalently coded form is mechanical, non-specific (ns) LBP associated with muscular tension, restrictions in mobility, and static malposition.Current treatment recommendations for nsLBP are largely ""non-specific"" as well, limited to symptomatic pain-relieving measures.In our propensity score-matched two cohort analyses of depersonalized real-world data from the German Pain e-Registry, a 4-week treatment with the muscle relaxant methocarbamol proved superior effective and significantly better tolerated than treatment with oral long-acting opioid analgesics in patients who poorly responded to recommended 1st line treatments.",2022,38,2,237-253,10.1080/03007995.2021.2003105,#3995,Ueberall 2022,German Pain e-Registry
1311,17555329.0,Hemoglobin-based O2 carrier O2 affinity and capillary inlet pO2 are important factors that influence O2 transport in a capillary.,Biotechnol Prog,"Hemopure (Biopure; Cambridge, MA) and PolyHeme (Northfield Laboratories; Evanston, IL) are two acellular hemoglobin-based O2 carriers (HBOCs) currently in phase III clinical trials for use as red blood cell substitutes. The most common adverse side effect that these HBOCs exhibit is increased vasoconstriction. Autoregulatory theory has been presented as a possible explanation for this physiological effect, where it is hypothesized that low-affinity HBOCs over-deliver O2 to tissues surrounding arterioles, thereby eliciting vasoconstriction. In this paper, we wanted to investigate HBOC oxygenation of tissue surrounding a capillary, which is the smallest element of the circulatory system. An a priori model has been developed in which the performance of mixtures of acellular HBOCs (synthesized by our group and others) and human red blood cells (hRBCs) has been simulated using a Krogh tissue cylinder model (KTCM) comprising a capillary surrounded by a capillary membrane and skeletal muscle tissue in cylindrical coordinates with specified tissue O2 consumption rates and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In this study, the total hemoglobin (hRBCs and HBOCs) concentration was kept constant. The HBOCs studied possessed O2 affinities that were higher and lower compared to hRBCs (P50's spanned 5-55 mmHg), and the equilibrium binding/release of oxygen to/from the HBOCs was modeled using the Adair equation. At normoxic inlet pO2's, there was no correlation between O2 flux out of the capillary and the O2 affinity of the HBOC. However, a correlation was found between the average pO2 tension in the capillary and the O2 affinity of the HBOC. Additionally, we studied the change in the O2 equilibrium curve of HBOCs with different O2 affinities over a wide range of inlet pO2's and found that changing the inlet pO2 greatly affected which HBOC, having a unique O2 affinity, best delivered O2 to the surrounding tissue. The analysis of oxygen transport presented could lead to a better prediction of which acellular HBOC is best suited for a specific transfusion application that many times depends on the capillary inlet pO2 tension.",2007,23,4,921-31,10.1021/bp0700298,#3996,Dimino 2007,
1312,33792548.0,Biofeedback-Based Connected Mental Health Interventions for Anxiety: Systematic Literature Review.,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,"BACKGROUND: Connected mental health, which refers to the use of technology for mental health care and technology-based therapeutic solutions, has become an established field of research. Biofeedback is one of the approaches used in connected mental health solutions, which is mainly based on the analysis of physiological indicators for the assessment and management of the psychological state. Biofeedback is recommended by many therapists and has been used for conditions including depression, insomnia, and anxiety. Anxiety is associated with several physiological symptoms, including muscle tension and breathing issues, which makes the inclusion of biofeedback useful for anxiety detection and management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify interventions using biofeedback as a part of their process for anxiety management and investigate their perceived effectiveness. METHODS: A systematic literature review of publications presenting empirically evaluated biofeedback-based interventions for anxiety was conducted. The systematic literature review was based on publications retrieved from IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. A preliminary selection of papers was identified, examined, and filtered to include only relevant publications. Studies in the final selection were classified and analyzed to extract the modalities of use of biofeedback in the identified interventions, the types of physiological data that were collected and analyzed and the sensors used to collect them. Processes and outcomes of the empirical evaluations were also extracted. RESULTS: After final selection, 13 publications presenting different interventions were investigated. The interventions addressed either primarily anxiety disorders or anxiety associated with health issues such as migraine, Parkinson disease, and rheumatology. Solutions combined biofeedback with other techniques including virtual reality, music therapy, games, and relaxation practices and used different sensors including cardiovascular belts, wrist sensors, or stretch sensors to collect physiological data such as heart rate, respiration indicators, and movement information. The interventions targeted different cohorts including children, students, and patients. Overall, outcomes from the empirical evaluations yielded positive results and emphasized the effectiveness of connected mental health solutions using biofeedback for anxiety; however, certain unfavorable outcomes, such as interventions not having an effect on anxiety and patients' preferring traditional therapy, were reported in studies addressing patients with specific physical health issues. CONCLUSIONS: The use of biofeedback in connected mental health interventions for the treatment and management of anxiety allows better screening and understanding of both psychological and physiological patient information, as well as of the association between the two. The inclusion of biofeedback could improve the outcome of interventions and boost their effectiveness; however, when used with patients suffering from certain physical health issues, suitability investigations are needed.",2021,9,4,e26038,10.2196/26038,#3997,Alneyadi 2021,anxiety
1313,31357389.0,The Effect of Chitosan Derivatives on the Compaction and Tension Generation of the Fibroblast-populated Collagen Matrix.,Molecules,"Fibrotic diseases, such as Dupuytren's contracture (DC), involve excess scar tissue formation. The differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts is a significant mechanism in DC, as it generates tissue contraction in areas without wound openings, leading to the deposition of scar tissue, and eventually flexing one or more fingers in a restrictive fashion. Additionally, DC has a high recurrence rate. Previously, we showed that N-dihydrogalactochitosan (GC), an immunostimulant, inhibited myofibroblast differentiation in a DC fibroblast culture. Our goal of this study was to expand our previous study to include other DC and normal cell lines and other chitosan derivatives (GC and single-walled carbon nanotube-conjugated GC) to determine the specific mechanism of inhibition. Derivative-incorporated and vehicle control (water) anchored fibroblast-populated collagen matrices (aFPCM) were used to monitor compaction (anchored matrix height reduction) using microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) for six days. Fibroblasts were unable to compact chitosan derivative aFPCM to the same extent as vehicle control aFPCM in repeated experiments. Similarly, chitosan derivative aFPCM contracted less than control aFPCM when released from anchorage. Proliferative myofibroblasts were identified by the presence of alpha smooth muscle actin via myofibroblast proliferative assay. In all tested conditions, a small percentage of myofibroblasts and proliferative cells were present. However, when aFPCM were treated with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), all tested samples demonstrated increased myofibroblasts, proliferation, compaction, and contraction. Although compaction and contraction were reduced, there was sufficient tension present in the chitosan derivative aFPCM to allow exogenous stimulation of the myofibroblast phenotype.",2019,24,15,,10.3390/molecules24152713,#3998,Doan 2019,Dupuytrenâs Contracture
1314,29437149.0,Transgelin-2 as a therapeutic target for asthmatic pulmonary resistance.,Sci Transl Med,"There is a clinical need for new bronchodilator drugs in asthma, because more than half of asthmatic patients do not receive adequate control with current available treatments. We report that inhibition of metallothionein-2 protein expression in lung tissues causes the increase of pulmonary resistance. Conversely, metallothionein-2 protein is more effective than β(2)-agonists in reducing pulmonary resistance in rodent asthma models, alleviating tension in tracheal spirals, and relaxing airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Metallothionein-2 relaxes ASMCs via transgelin-2 (TG2) and induces dephosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1). We identify TSG12 as a nontoxic, specific TG2-agonist that relaxes ASMCs and reduces asthmatic pulmonary resistance. In vivo, TSG12 reduces pulmonary resistance in both ovalbumin- and house dust mite-induced asthma in mice. TSG12 induces RhoA phosphorylation, thereby inactivating the RhoA-ROCK-MYPT1-MLC pathway and causing ASMCs relaxation. TSG12 is more effective than β(2)-agonists in relaxing human ASMCs and pulmonary resistance with potential clinical advantages. These results suggest that TSG12 could be a promising therapeutic approach for treating asthma.",2018,10,427,,10.1126/scitranslmed.aam8604,#3999,Yin 2018,
1315,20189084.0,"Vascular risk factors, endothelial function, and carotid thickness in patients with migraine: relationship to atherosclerosis.",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,"Recent studies indicated that migraine is associated with specific vascular risk profile. However, the functional and structural vascular abnormalities in migraine are rarely addressed. We evaluated the vascular risk factors, endothelial function, and carotid artery (CA)-intima-media thickness (IMT), segregators of preclinical atherosclerosis, in migraineurs. This preliminary study included 63 adults with headache (migraine with aura [n=14], migraine without aura [n=24], transformed migraine [n=6], and tension headache [n=19]) and 35 matched healthy subjects. The following vascular risks were assessed: body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressures (DBP), serum levels of C-reactive protein, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Plasma endothelin (ET)-1, a vasoactive peptide produced by vascular smooth muscle cells and marker for endothelial injury and atherosclerosis, was measured. Endothelial-dependent vasoreactivity was assessed using brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in response to hyperemia. CA-IMT, structural marker of early atherosclerosis, was measured. Compared with control subjects, SBP, DBP, glucose, insulin, ET-1, and CA-IMT were elevated with migraine. FMD% was inversely correlated with SBP (P < .001), DBP (P < .01), glucose (P < .001), and insulin levels (P < .01). CA-IMT was correlated with BMI (P < .05), SBP (P < .01), total cholesterol (P < .01), triglycerides (P < .001), glucose (P < .001), insulin (P < .01), and FMD% (P < .05). In multivariate analysis, ET-1 was correlated with duration of illness, SBP, DBP, glucose, insulin, IMT, and FMD%. We conclude that endothelial injury, impaired endothelial vasoreactivity, and increased CA-IMT occur with migraine and are associated with vascular risk factors that strongly suggest that migraine could be a risk for atherosclerosis.",2010,19,2,92-103,10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2009.04.007,#4000,Hamed 2010,
1316,24204680.0,Targeting the tumour vasculature: exploitation of low oxygenation and sensitivity to NOS inhibition by treatment with a hypoxic cytotoxin.,PLoS One,"Many cancer research efforts focus on exploiting genetic-level features that may be targeted for therapy. Tissue-level features of the tumour microenvironment also represent useful therapeutic targets. Here we investigate the presence of low oxygen tension and sensitivity to NOS inhibition of tumour vasculature as potential tumour-specific features that may be targeted by hypoxic cytotoxins, a class of therapeutics currently under investigation. We have previously demonstrated that tirapazamine (TPZ) mediates central vascular dysfunction in tumours. TPZ is a hypoxic cytotoxin that is also a competitive inhibitor of NOS. Here we further investigated the vascular-targeting activity of TPZ by combining it with NOS inhibitor L-NNA, or with low oxygen content gas breathing. Tumours were analyzed via multiplex immunohistochemical staining that revealed irreversible loss of perfusion and enhanced tumour cell death when TPZ was combined with either low oxygen or a NOS inhibitor. Tumour growth rate was reduced by TPZ + NOS inhibition, and tumours previously resistant to TPZ-mediated vascular dysfunction were sensitized by low oxygen breathing. Additional mapping analysis suggests that tumours with reduced vascular-associated stroma may have greater sensitivity to these effects. These results indicate that poorly oxygenated tumour vessels, also being abnormally organized and with inadequate smooth muscle, may be successfully targeted for significant anti-cancer effects by inhibition of NOS and hypoxia-activated prodrug toxicity. This strategy illustrates a novel use of hypoxia-activated cytotoxic prodrugs as vascular targeting agents, and also represents a novel mechanism for targeting tumour vessels.",2013,8,10,e76832,10.1371/journal.pone.0076832,#4001,Baker 2013,
1317,23235575.0,Interventions for treating proximal humeral fractures in adults.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"BACKGROUND: Fractures of the proximal humerus are common injuries. The management, including surgical intervention, of these fractures varies widely. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and last updated in 2010. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence supporting the various treatment and rehabilitation interventions for proximal humeral fractures. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and other databases, and bibliographies of trial reports. The full search ended in January 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials pertinent to the management of proximal humeral fractures in adults were selected. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two people performed independent study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Only limited meta-analysis was performed. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-three small randomised trials with a total of 1238 participants were included. Bias in these trials could not be ruled out. Additionally there is a need for caution in interpreting the results of these small trials, which generally do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that any non-statistically significant finding is 'evidence of no effect'.Eight trials evaluated conservative treatment. One trial found an arm sling was generally more comfortable than a less commonly used body bandage. There was some evidence that 'immediate' physiotherapy compared with that delayed until after three weeks of immobilisation resulted in less pain and potentially better recovery in people with undisplaced or other stable fractures. Similarly, there was evidence that mobilisation at one week instead of three weeks alleviated short term pain without compromising long term outcome. Two trials provided some evidence that unsupervised patients could generally achieve a satisfactory outcome when given sufficient instruction for an adequate self-directed exercise programme.Six heterogeneous trials, involving a total of 270 participants with displaced and/or complex fractures, compared surgical versus conservative treatment. Pooled results of patient-reported functional scores at one year from three trials (153 participants) showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (standardised mean difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.22; negative results favour surgery). Quality of life based on the EuroQol results scores from three trials (153 participants) showed non-statistically significant differences between the two groups at three time points up to 12 months. However, the pooled EuroQol results at two years (101 participants) from two trials run concurrently from the same centre were significantly in favour of the surgical group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in mortality (8/98 versus 5/98; RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.36; 4 trials). Significantly more surgical group patients had additional or secondary surgery (18/112 versus 5/111; RR 3.36, 95% CI 1.33 to 8.49; 5 trials). This is equivalent to an extra operation in one of every nine surgically treated patients.Different methods of surgical management were tested in seven small trials. One trial comparing two types of locking plate versus a locking nail for treating two-part surgical neck fractures found some evidence of better function after plate fixation but also of a higher rate of surgically-related complications. One trial comparing a locking plate versus minimally invasive fixation with distally inserted intramedullary nails found some evidence of a short-term benefit for the nailing group. Compared with hemiarthroplasty, tension-band fixation of severe injuries using wires was associated with a higher re-operation rate in one trial. Two trials found no important differences between 'polyaxial' and 'monaxial' screws combined with locking plate fixation. One trial produced some preliminary evidence that tended to support the use of medial support locking screws in locking plate fixation. One trial found better functional results for one of two types of hemiarthroplasty.Very limited evidence suggested similar outcomes from early versus later mobilisation after either surgical fixation (one trial) or hemiarthroplasty (one trial). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to inform the management of these fractures. Early physiotherapy, without immobilisation, may be sufficient for some types of undisplaced fractures. It remains unclear whether surgery, even for specific fracture types, will produce consistently better long term outcomes but it is likely to be associated with a higher risk of surgery-related complications and requirement for further surgery.There is insufficient evidence to establish what is the best method of surgical treatment, either in terms of the use of different categories of surgical intervention (such as plate versus nail fixation, or hemiarthroplasty versus tension-wire fixation) or different methods of performing an intervention in the same category (such as different methods of plate fixation). There is insufficient evidence to say when to start mobilisation after either surgical fixation or hemiarthroplasty.",2012,12,,CD000434,10.1002/14651858.CD000434.pub3,#4002,Handoll 2012,
1318,23316963.0,Matrix metalloproteinases as potential targets in the venous dilation associated with varicose veins.,Curr Drug Targets,"Varicose veins (VVs) are a common venous disease of the lower extremity characterized by incompetent valves, venous reflux, and dilated and tortuous veins. If untreated, VVs could lead to venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis and chronic venous leg ulcers. Various genetic, hormonal and environmental factors may lead to structural changes in the vein valves and make them incompetent, leading to venous reflux, increased venous pressure and vein wall dilation. Prolonged increases in venous pressure and vein wall tension are thought to increase the expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Members of the MMPs family include collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, matrilysins, membrane- type MMPs and others. MMPs are known to degrade various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). MMPs may also affect the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle, causing changes in the vein relaxation and contraction mechanisms. Endothelial cell injury also triggers leukocyte infiltration, activation and inflammation, which lead to further vein wall damage. The vein wall dilation and valve dysfunction, and the MMP activation and superimposed inflammation and fibrosis would lead to progressive venous dilation and VVs formation. Surgical ablation is an effective treatment for VVs, but may be associated with high recurrence rate, and other less invasive approaches that target the cause of the disease are needed. MMP inhibitors including endogenous tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) and pharmacological inhibitors such as zinc chelators, doxycycline, batimastat and marimastat, have been used as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in cancer, autoimmune and cardiovascular disease. However, MMP inhibitors may have side effects especially on the musculoskeletal system. With the advent of new genetic and pharmacological tools, specific MMP inhibitors with fewer undesirable effects could be useful to retard the progression and prevent the recurrence of VVs.",2013,14,3,287-324,,#4003,Kucukguven 2013,
1319,34085706.0,Synthetic resin acid derivatives selectively open the hK(V) 7.2/7.3 channel and prevent epileptic seizures.,Epilepsia,"OBJECTIVE: About one third of all patients with epilepsy have pharmacoresistant seizures. Thus there is a need for better pharmacological treatments. The human voltage-gated potassium (hK(V) ) channel hK(V) 7.2/7.3 is a validated antiseizure target for compounds that activate this channel. In a previous study we have shown that resin acid derivatives can activate the hK(V) 7.2/7.3 channel. In this study we investigated if these channel activators have the potential to be developed into a new type of antiseizure drug. Thus we examined their structure-activity relationships and the site of action on the hK(V) 7.2/7.3 channel, if they have unwanted cardiac and cardiovascular effects, and their potential antiseizure effect. METHODS: Ion channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cell lines and explored with two-electrode voltage-clamp or automated patch-clamp techniques. Unwanted vascular side effects were investigated with isometric tension recordings. Antiseizure activity was studied in an electrophysiological zebrafish-larvae model. RESULTS: Fourteen resin acid derivatives were tested on hK(V) 7.2/7.3. The most efficient channel activators were halogenated and had a permanently negatively charged sulfonyl group. The compounds did not bind to the sites of other hK(V) 7.2/7.3 channel activators, retigabine, or ICA-069673. Instead, they interacted with the most extracellular gating charge of the S4 voltage-sensing helix, and the effects are consistent with an electrostatic mechanism. The compounds altered the voltage dependence of hK(V) 7.4, but in contrast to retigabine, there were no effects on the maximum conductance. Consistent with these data, the compounds had less smooth muscle-relaxing effect than retigabine. The compounds had almost no effect on the voltage dependence of hK(V) 11.1, hNa(V) 1.5, or hCa(V) 1.2, or on the amplitude of hK(V) 11.1. Finally, several resin acid derivatives had clear antiseizure effects in a zebrafish-larvae model. SIGNIFICANCE: The described resin acid derivatives hold promise for new antiseizure medications, with reduced risk for adverse effects compared with retigabine.",2021,62,7,1744-1758,10.1111/epi.16932,#4004,Ottosson 2021,epilepsy
1320,27789473.0,Kv7 Channel Activation Underpins EPAC-Dependent Relaxations of Rat Arteries.,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of Kv7 channels in EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP)-dependent relaxations of the rat vasculature and to investigate whether this contributes to β-adrenoceptor-mediated vasorelaxations. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Isolated rat renal and mesenteric arteries (RA and MA, respectively) were used for isometric tension recording to study the relaxant effects of a specific EPAC activator and the β-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol in the presence of potassium channel inhibitors and cell signaling modulators. Isolated myocytes were used in proximity ligation assay studies to detect localization of signaling intermediaries with Kv7.4 before and after cell stimulation. Our studies showed that the EPAC activator (8-pCPT-2Me-cAMP-AM) produced relaxations and enhanced currents of MA and RA that were sensitive to linopirdine (Kv7 inhibitor). Linopirdine also inhibited isoproterenol-mediated relaxations in both RA and MA. In the MA, isoproterenol relaxations were sensitive to EPAC inhibition, but not protein kinase A inhibition. In contrast, isoproterenol relaxations in RA were attenuated by protein kinase A but not by EPAC inhibition. Proximity ligation assay showed a localization of Kv7.4 with A-kinase anchoring protein in both vessels in the basal state, which increased only in the RA with isoproterenol stimulation. In the MA, but not the RA, a localization of Kv7.4 with both Rap1a and Rap2 (downstream of EPAC) increased with isoproterenol stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: EPAC-dependent vasorelaxations occur in part via activation of Kv7 channels. This contributes to the isoproterenol-mediated relaxation in mesenteric, but not renal, arteries.",2016,36,12,2404-2411,10.1161/ATVBAHA.116.308517,#4005,Stott 2016,K channel
1321,31511778.0,Curcumin Inhibits Joint Contracture through PTEN Demethylation and Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway in Myofibroblasts from Human Joint Capsule.,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,"Joint contracture is increasingly regarded as a clinical problem that leads to irreversible dysfunction of the joint. It is a pathophysiological process following joint injury, which is marked by the activation of myofibroblasts. There is currently no effective treatment for the prevention of joint contracture. Curcumin is a polyphenol pigment extracted from turmeric, which possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and antitumor properties. In the present study, we demonstrated that curcumin exerts a protective effect against joint contracture via the inhibition of myofibroblast proliferation and migration in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, we indicated that phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) was downregulated in myofibroblasts in vitro and in the contracture capsule tissues of patients in vivo. Additionally, western blot analysis revealed a negative correlation between the expression levels of PTEN and the fibrosis marker protein alpha smooth muscle cell actin. Methylation-specific PCR results suggested that curcumin was able to demethylate PTEN in a similar manner to the demethylation agent 5-azacytidine, increasing PTEN expression and further inhibiting phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. In conclusion, our data illustrate part of the mechanism of curcumin inhibition in joint contracture. These results support the hypothesis that curcumin may potentially be used as a novel candidate for the treatment of joint contracture.",2019,2019,,4301238,10.1155/2019/4301238,#4006,Zhuang 2019,
1322,23728641.0,Drug therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea in adults.,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of choice for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) applied via a mask during sleep. However, this is not tolerated by all individuals and its role in mild OSA is not proven. Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea and could be of value in patients intolerant of CPAP. A number of mechanisms have been proposed by which drugs could reduce the severity of OSA. These include an increase in tone in the upper airway dilator muscles, an increase in ventilatory drive, a reduction in the proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, an increase in cholinergic tone during sleep, an increase in arousal threshold, a reduction in airway resistance and a reduction in surface tension in the upper airway. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of drug therapies in the specific treatment of sleep apnoea. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Searches were current as of July 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, placebo controlled trials involving adult patients with confirmed OSA. We excluded trials if continuous positive airways pressure, mandibular devices or oxygen therapy were used. We excluded studies investigating treatment of associated conditions such as excessive sleepiness, hypertension, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and obesity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty trials of 25 drugs, involving 516 participants, contributed data to the review. Drugs had several different proposed modes of action and the results were grouped accordingly in the review. Each of the studies stated that the participants had OSA but diagnostic criteria were not always explicit and it was possible that some patients with central apnoeas may have been recruited.Acetazolamide, eszopiclone, naltrexone, nasal lubricant (phosphocholinamine) and physiostigmine were administered for one to two nights only. Donepezil in patients with and without Alzheimer's disease, fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis, combinations of ondansetrone and fluoxetine and paroxetine were trials of one to three months duration, however most of the studies were small and had methodological limitations. The overall quality of the available evidence was low.The primary outcomes for the systematic review were the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and the level of sleepiness associated with OSA, estimated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). AHI was reported in 25 studies and of these 10 showed statistically significant reductions in AHI.Fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis was well tolerated and reduced the severity of sleep apnoea compared with placebo (AHI 23.3 versus 30.3; P < 0.05) and improved subjective daytime alertness. Excessive sleepiness was reported to be altered in four studies, however the only clinically and statistically significant change in ESS of -2.9 (SD 2.9; P = 0.04) along with a small but statistically significant reduction in AHI of -9.4 (SD 17.2; P = 0.03) was seen in patients without Alzheimer's disease receiving donepezil for one month. In 23 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease donepezil led to a significant reduction in AHI (donepezil 20 (SD 15) to 9.9 (SD 11.5) versus placebo 23.2 (SD 26.4) to 22.9 (SD 28.8); P = 0.035) after three months of treatment but no reduction in sleepiness was reported. High dose combined treatment with ondansetron 24 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg showed a 40.5% decrease in AHI from the baseline at treatment day 28. Paroxetine was shown to reduce AHI compared to placebo (-6.10 events/hour; 95% CI -11.00 to -1.20) but failed to improve daytime symptoms.Promising results from the preliminary mirtazapine study failed to be reproduced in the two more recent multicentre trials and, moreover, the use of mirtazapine was associated with significant weight gain and sleepiness. Few data were presented on the long-term tolerability of any of the compounds used. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of drug therapy in the treatment of OSA. Small studies have reported positive effects of certain agents on short-term outcomes. Certain agents have been shown to reduce the AHI in largely unselected populations with OSA by between 24% and 45%. For donepezil and fluticasone, studies of longer duration with a larger population and better matching of groups are required to establish whether the change in AHI and impact on daytime symptoms are reproducible. Individual patients had more complete responses to particular drugs. It is possible that better matching of drugs to patients according to the dominant mechanism of their OSA will lead to better results and this also needs further study.",2013,,5,CD003002,10.1002/14651858.CD003002.pub3,#4007,Mason 2013,
1323,34096878.0,"Integrating Behavior of Children with Profound Intellectual, Multiple, or Severe Motor Disabilities With Location and Environment Data Sensors for Independent Communication and Mobility: App Development and Pilot Testing.",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,"BACKGROUND: Children with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) or severe motor and intellectual disabilities (SMID) only communicate through movements, vocalizations, body postures, muscle tensions, or facial expressions on a pre- or protosymbolic level. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there are few systems developed to specifically aid in categorizing and interpreting behaviors of children with PIMD or SMID to facilitate independent communication and mobility. Further, environmental data such as weather variables were found to have associations with human affects and behaviors among typically developing children; however, studies involving children with neurological functioning impairments that affect communication or those who have physical and/or motor disabilities are unexpectedly scarce. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the design and development of the ChildSIDE app, which collects and transmits data associated with children's behaviors, and linked location and environment information collected from data sources (GPS, iBeacon device, ALPS Sensor, and OpenWeatherMap application programming interface [API]) to the database. The aims of this study were to measure and compare the server/API performance of the app in detecting and transmitting environment data from the data sources to the database, and to categorize the movements associated with each behavior data as the basis for future development and analyses. METHODS: This study utilized a cross-sectional observational design by performing multiple single-subject face-to-face and video-recorded sessions among purposively sampled child-caregiver dyads (children diagnosed with PIMD/SMID, or severe or profound intellectual disability and their primary caregivers) from September 2019 to February 2020. To measure the server/API performance of the app in detecting and transmitting data from data sources to the database, frequency distribution and percentages of 31 location and environment data parameters were computed and compared. To categorize which body parts or movements were involved in each behavior, the interrater agreement κ statistic was used. RESULTS: The study comprised 150 sessions involving 20 child-caregiver dyads. The app collected 371 individual behavior data, 327 of which had associated location and environment data from data collection sources. The analyses revealed that ChildSIDE had a server/API performance >93% in detecting and transmitting outdoor location (GPS) and environment data (ALPS sensors, OpenWeatherMap API), whereas the performance with iBeacon data was lower (82.3%). Behaviors were manifested mainly through hand (22.8%) and body movements (27.7%), and vocalizations (21.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The ChildSIDE app is an effective tool in collecting the behavior data of children with PIMD/SMID. The app showed high server/API performance in detecting outdoor location and environment data from sensors and an online API to the database with a performance rate above 93%. The results of the analysis and categorization of behaviors suggest a need for a system that uses motion capture and trajectory analyses for developing machine- or deep-learning algorithms to predict the needs of children with PIMD/SMID in the future.",2021,8,2,e28020,10.2196/28020,#4008,HerbuelaVRDM 2021,AAC
1324,20625952.0,2010 Nicolas Andry Award: Multipotent adult stem cells from adipose tissue for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.,Clin Orthop Relat Res,"BACKGROUND: Cell-based therapies such as tissue engineering provide promising therapeutic possibilities to enhance the repair or regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues but are dependent on the availability and controlled manipulation of appropriate cell sources. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that adult subcutaneous fat contains stem cells with multilineage potential and to determine the influence of specific soluble mediators and biomaterial scaffolds on their differentiation into musculoskeletal phenotypes. METHODS: We reviewed recent studies showing the stem-like characteristics and multipotency of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), and their potential application in cell-based therapies in orthopaedics. RESULTS: Under controlled conditions, ASCs show phenotypic characteristics of various cell types, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, neuronal cells, or muscle cells. In particular, the chondrogenic differentiation of ASCs can be induced by low oxygen tension, growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6), or biomaterial scaffolds consisting of native tissue matrices derived from cartilage. Finally, focus is given to the development of a functional biomaterial scaffold that can provide ASC-based constructs with mechanical properties similar to native cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: Adipose tissue contains an abundant source of multipotent progenitor cells. These cells show cell surface marker profiles and differentiation characteristics that are similar to but distinct from other adult stem cells, such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The availability of an easily accessible and reproducible cell source may greatly facilitate the development of new cell-based therapies for regenerative medicine applications in the musculoskeletal system.",2010,468,9,2530-40,10.1007/s11999-010-1410-9,#4009,Guilak 2010,
1325,30655633.0,Multidisciplinary approach to prostatitis.,Arch Ital Urol Androl,"The modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of Stamey and coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIHNIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organspecific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other ""genital mycoplasmas"" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. ""Next generation"" investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called ""dysbiosis"" causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.",2019,90,4,227-248,10.4081/aiua.2018.4.227,#4010,Magri 2019,
1326,30766719.0,"Stress and the menopausal transition in Campeche, Mexico.",Womens Midlife Health,"BACKGROUND: Stress has been implicated as a factor in the presence and severity of symptoms during the menopausal transition. Our primary aim was to test the hypothesis that stress-sensitive biological measures and self-reported stress would be positively associated with a greater likelihood and intensity of hot flashes. Our secondary aim was to examine measures of stress in relation to the most often reported symptoms in Campeche, Mexico. We also hypothesized ethnic differences (Maya versus non-Maya) in relation to measures of stress and symptom reports. METHODS: Participants aged 40-60 (n = 305) were drawn from multiple sites across the city of San Francisco de Campeche to achieve a generally representative sample. Measures included C-reactive protein (CRP), an indicator of inflammation; Epstein-Barr virus antibodies (EBV-Ab), an indicator of immune function; the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS); a symptom checklist; anthropometric measures; and a questionnaire that elicited symptoms, ethnicity (based on language, birthplace, and last names of the woman, her parents, and her grandparents) and ten dimensions of socioeconomic status (SES). The relationships between symptoms and stress-sensitive biological and self-reported measures were examined in bivariate analyses, and with logistic and linear regressions. RESULTS: The twelve most common symptoms reported, in descending order of frequency, were tiredness, muscle and joint pain, nervous tension, problems concentrating, feeling depressed, difficulty sleeping, headaches, feeling of ants crawling on the skin, loss of interest in sex, urinary stress incontinence, hot flashes, and night sweats. PSS scores were significantly associated with the likelihood of seven symptoms (yes/no), and with the intensity of ten symptoms after controlling for ethnicity, SES, education, cohabitation status, parity, smoking, body mass index, and menopausal status. The stress-sensitive biological measures of immune function (EBV-Ab and CRP) were not significantly associated with midlife symptoms. The PSS was associated with more symptoms among the Maya (e.g., feeling nervous/tense and having difficulty concentrating) than non-Maya. CONCLUSION: PSS scores were associated with the intensity, but not the likelihood, of hot flashes. Other symptoms were also associated with self-reported stress but not with physiological measures. Maya/non-Maya differences may indicate that either symptoms or stress were experienced and/or reported in culture-specific ways.",2018,4,,9,10.1186/s40695-018-0038-x,#4011,Sievert 2018,Depression
1327,34683200.0,A Time Division Multiplexing Inspired Lightweight Soft Exoskeleton for Hip and Ankle Joint Assistance.,Micromachines (Basel),"Exoskeleton robots are frequently applied to augment or assist the user's natural motion. Generally, each assisted joint corresponds to at least one specific motor to ensure the independence of movement between joints. This means that as there are more joints to be assisted, more motors are required, resulting in increasing robot weight, decreasing motor utilization, and weakening exoskeleton robot assistance efficiency. To solve this problem, the design and control of a lightweight soft exoskeleton that assists hip-plantar flexion of both legs in different phases during a gait cycle with only one motor is presented in this paper. Inspired by time-division multiplexing and the symmetry of walking motion, an actuation scheme that uses different time-periods of the same motor to transfer different forces to different joints is formulated. An automatic winding device is designed to dynamically change the loading path of the assistive force at different phases of the gait cycle. The system is designed to assist hip flexion and plantar flexion of both legs with only one motor, since there is no overlap between the hip flexion movement and the toe-offs movement of the separate legs during walking. The weight of the whole system is only 2.24 kg. PD iterative control is accomplished by an algorithm that utilizes IMUs attached on the thigh recognizing the maximum hip extension angle to characterize toe-offs indirectly, and two load cells to monitor the cable tension. In the study of six subjects, muscle fatigue of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius and soleus decreased by an average of 14.69%, 6.66%, 17.71%, and 8.15%, respectively, compared to scenarios without an exoskeleton.",2021,12,10,,10.3390/mi12101150,#4012,Ye 2021,gait event detection

Both length-force and force-velocity relationships depend on the spatial arrangement of muscle fibres in skeletal muscle. The degree of muscle pennation determines both the amount of contractile tissue packed along the tendons and fibre length, and is reflected by the force-generating capacity and shortening velocity of the muscle and by the elastic properties of the muscle-tendon complex. Until recently, knowledge on human muscle architecture was based on measurements performed on cadavers, whose muscle fibres were often shrunk by the preserving medium and by age. With the introduction of non-invasive imaging techniques, it has become possible to study muscle architecture in vivo at rest and the changes thereof upon contraction.

We developed a highly sensitive single muscle fiber proteomics workflow to study human aging and show that the senescence of slow and fast muscle fibers is characterized by diverging metabolic and protein quality control adaptations. Whereas mitochondrial content declines with aging in both fiber types, glycolysis and glycogen metabolism are upregulated in slow but downregulated in fast muscle fibers. Aging mitochondria decrease expression of the redox enzyme monoamine oxidase A. Slow fibers upregulate a subset of actin and myosin chaperones, whereas an opposite change happens in fast fibers. These changes in metabolism and sarcomere quality control may be related to the ability of slow, but not fast, muscle fibers to maintain their mass during aging.

1334,17071088.0,Static optimization of muscle forces during gait in comparison to EMG-to-force processing approach,Gait & posture,"Individual muscle forces evaluated from experimental motion analysis may be useful in mathematical simulation, but require additional musculoskeletal and mathematical modelling. A numerical method of static optimization was used in this study to evaluate muscular forces during gait. The numerical algorithm used was built on the basis of traditional optimization techniques, i.e., constrained minimization technique using the Lagrange multiplier method to solve for constraints. Measuring exact muscle forces during gait analysis is not currently possible. The developed optimization method calculates optimal forces during gait, given a specific performance criterion, using kinematics and kinetics from gait analysis together with muscle architectural data. Experimental methods to validate mathematical methods to calculate forces are limited. Electromyography (EMG) is frequently used as a tool to determine muscle activation in experimental studies on human motion. A method of estimating force from the EMG signal, the EMG-to-force approach, was recently developed by Bogey et al. [Bogey RA, Perry J, Gitter AJ. An EMG-to-force processing approach for determining ankle muscle forcs during normal human gait. IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng 2005;13:302-10] and is based on normalization of activation during a maximum voluntary contraction to documented maximal muscle strength. This method was adapted in this study as a tool with which to compare static optimization during a gait cycle. Muscle forces from static optimization and from EMG-to-force muscle forces show reasonably good correlation in the plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles, but less correlation in the knee flexor and extensor muscles. Additional comparison of the mathematical muscle forces from static optimization to documented averaged EMG data reveals good overall correlation to patterns of evaluated muscular activation. This indicates that on an individual level, muscular force patterns from mathematical models can arguably be more accurate than from those obtained from surface EMG during gait, though magnitude must still be validated.",2007,26,2,279-288,,#4046,Heintz 2007,

Despite the considerable structural and functional alterations, the elderly musculoskeletal system displays remarkable adaptability to training in old age and many of these adverse effects may be substantially mitigated, if not reversed, by resistive loading. The interplay between these muscular and tendinous adaptations has an impact both on the length-force and force-velocity relationships of the muscle and is likely to affect the range of motion, rate of force development, maximum force development and speed of movement of the older individual.",2005,15,6,392-401,,#4048,Narici 2005, 
1337,17241104.0,Morphological and neurological contributions to increased strength,Sports medicine,"High-resistance strength training (HRST) is one of the most widely practiced forms of physical activity, which is used to enhance athletic performance, augment musculo-skeletal health and alter body aesthetics. Chronic exposure to this type of activity produces marked increases in muscular strength, which are attributed to a range of neurological and morphological adaptations. This review assesses the evidence for these adaptations, their interplay and contribution to enhanced strength and the methodologies employed. The primary morphological adaptations involve an increase in the cross-sectional area of the whole muscle and individual muscle fibres, which is due to an increase in myofibrillar size and number. Satellite cells are activated in the very early stages of training; their proliferation and later fusion with existing fibres appears to be intimately involved in the hypertrophy response. Other possible morphological adaptations include hyperplasia, changes in fibre type, muscle architecture, myofilament density and the structure of connective tissue and tendons. Indirect evidence for neurological adaptations, which encompasses learning and coordination, comes from the specificity of the training adaptation, transfer of unilateral training to the contralateral limb and imagined contractions. The apparent rise in whole-muscle specific tension has been primarily used as evidence for neurological adaptations; however, morphological factors (e.g. preferential hypertrophy of type 2 fibres, increased angle of fibre pennation, increase in radiological density) are also likely to contribute to this phenomenon. Changes in inter-muscular coordination appear critical. Adaptations in agonist muscle activation, as assessed by electromyography, tetanic stimulation and the twitch interpolation technique, suggest small, but significant increases. Enhanced firing frequency and spinal reflexes most likely explain this improvement, although there is contrary evidence suggesting no change in cortical or corticospinal excitability. The gains in strength with HRST are undoubtedly due to a wide combination of neurological and morphological factors. Whilst the neurological factors may make their greatest contribution during the early stages of a training programme, hypertrophic processes also commence at the onset of training.",2007,37,2,145-168,,#4049,Folland 2007, 
1338,11454977.0,A mechanism for increased contractile strength of human pennate muscle in response to strength training: changes in muscle architecture,The journal of physiology,"1. In human pennate muscle, changes in anatomical cross-sectional area (CSA) or volume caused by training or inactivity may not necessarily reflect the change in physiological CSA, and thereby in maximal contractile force, since a simultaneous change in muscle fibre pennation angle could also occur. 2. Eleven male subjects undertook 14 weeks of heavy-resistance strength training of the lower limb muscles. Before and after training anatomical CSA and volume of the human quadriceps femoris muscle were assessed by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle fibre pennation angle (theta(p)) was measured in the vastus lateralis (VL) by use of ultrasonography, and muscle fibre CSA (CSA(fibre)) was obtained by needle biopsy sampling in VL. 3. Anatomical muscle CSA and volume increased with training from 77.5 +/- 3.0 to 85.0 +/- 2.7 cm(2) and 1676 +/- 63 to 1841 +/- 57 cm(3), respectively (+/- S.E.M.). Furthermore, VL pennation angle increased from 8.0 +/- 0.4 to 10.7 +/- 0.6 deg and CSA(fibre) increased from 3754 +/- 271 to 4238 +/- 202 microm (2). Isometric quadriceps strength increased from 282.6 +/- 11.7 to 327.0 +/- 12.4 N m. 4. A positive relationship was observed between theta(p) and quadriceps volume prior to training (r = 0.622). Multifactor regression analysis revealed a stronger relationship when theta(p) and CSA(fibre) were combined (R = 0.728). Post-training increases in CSA(fibre) were related to the increase in quadriceps volume (r = 0.749). 5. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform distribution (type I and II) remained unaltered with training. 6. VL muscle fibre pennation angle was observed to increase in response to resistance training. This allowed single muscle fibre CSA and maximal contractile strength to increase more (+16 %) than anatomical muscle CSA and volume (+10 %). 7. Collectively, the present data suggest that the morphology, architecture and contractile capacity of human pennate muscle are interrelated, in vivo. This interaction seems to include the specific adaptation responses evoked by intensive resistance training.",2001,534,2,613-623,,#4050,Aagaard 2001, 
1339,19638363.0,Variation in the determinants of power of chemically skinned human muscle fibres,Experimental physiology,"We have explored the extent to which the maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (V(max)), the force generated per unit cross-sectional area (P(0)) and the curvature of the force-velocity relationship (a/P(0) in the Hill equation) contribute to differences in peak power of chemically skinned single fibres from the quadriceps muscle of healthy young male subjects. The analysis was restricted to type I and IIA fibres that contained a single type of myosin heavy chain on electrophoretic separation. Force-velocity relationships were determined from isotonic contractions of maximally activated fibres at 15 degrees C. Mean (+/- s.d.) peak powers were 1.99 +/- 0.72 watts per litre (W L(-1)) for type I fibres and 6.92 +/- 2.41 W L(-1), for type IIA fibres. The most notable feature, however, was the very large, sevenfold, range of power outputs within a single fibre type. This wide range was a consequence of variations in each of the three components determining power: P(0), V(max) and a/P(0). Within a single fibre type, P(0) varied threefold, and V(max) and a/P(0) two- to threefold. There were no obvious relationships between P(0) and V(max) or between P(0) and a/P(0). However, there was a suggestion of an inverse relationship between a/P(0) and V(max), the effect being to reduce, somewhat, the impact of differences in V(max) on peak power. In searching for the causes of variation in peak power of fibres of the same type, it appears likely that there are two factors, one that affects P(0) and another that leads to variation in both V(max) and a/P(0).",2009,94,10,1070-1078,,#4051,Gilliver 2009, 
1340,34184088.0,Age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction: causes and mechanisms,Journal of musculoskeletal and neuronal interactions,"Aging causes skeletal muscle atrophy, and myofiber loss can be a critical component of this process. In 1989, Rosenberg emphasized the importance of the loss of skeletal muscle mass that occurs with aging and coined the term 'sarcopenia'. Since then, sarcopenia has attracted considerable attention due to the aging population in developed countries. The presence of sarcopenia is closely related to staggering, falls and even frailty in the elderly, which in turn leads to the need for nursing care. Sarcopenia is often associated with a poor prognosis in the elderly. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the causes and pathogenesis of sarcopenia, and to develop and introduce interventional strategies in line with these causes and pathogenesis. Sarcopenia can be a primary component of physical frailty. The association between sarcopenia, frailty and locomotive syndrome is complex; however, sarcopenia is a muscle‑specific concept that is relatively easy to approach in research. In the elderly, a lack of exercise, malnutrition and hormonal changes lead to neuromuscular junction insufficiency, impaired capillary blood flow, reduced repair and regeneration capacity due to a decrease in the number of muscle satellite cells, the infiltration of inflammatory cells and oxidative stress, resulting in muscle protein degradation exceeding synthesis. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction causes metabolic abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, which may lead to quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in skeletal muscle, resulting in sarcopenia. The present review article focuses on age‑related primary sarcopenia and outlines its pathogenesis and mechanisms.",2007,7,3,246-252,,#4052,Degens 2007,mechanism

Strength-training in older adults is a suitable intervention that may counteract the age-related loss in force production. The neuromuscular adaptations (i.e., cortical, spinal and muscular) to strength-training in older adults are largely equivocal and a systematic review with meta-analysis will serve to clarify the present circumstances regarding the benefits of strength-training in older adults. 20 studies entered the meta-analysis and were analysed using a random-effects model. A best evidence synthesis that included 36 studies was performed for variables that had insufficient data for meta-analysis. One study entered both. There was strong evidence that strength-training increases maximal force production, rate of force development and muscle activation in older adults. There was limited evidence for strength-training to improve voluntary-activation, the volitional-wave and spinal excitability, but strong evidence for increased muscle mass. The findings suggest that strength-training performed between 2 and 12 weeks increases strength, rate of force development and muscle activation, which likely improves motoneurone excitability by increased motor unit recruitment and improved discharge rates.",1989,74,3,233-256,,#4053,Jones 1989,Ageing

We hypothesized that unloading and shortening of soleus during HSU reduces densities of thin filaments, generating wider myofilament separations that increase V0 and decrease specific tension (kN/m2). During HSU, plantarflexion shortened soleus working length 23%. AL length was unchanged. Both muscles atrophied as shown by reductions in fiber cross-sectional area. For AL, the 60% atrophy accounted fully for the 58% decrease in absolute tension (mN). In the soleus, the 67% decline in absolute tension resulted from 58% atrophy plus a 17% reduction in specific tension. Soleus fibers exhibited a 25% reduction in thin filaments, whereas there was no change in AL thin filament density. Loss of thin filaments is consistent with reduced cross bridge formation, explaining the fall in specific tension. V0 increased 27% in soleus but was unchanged in AL. The V0 of control and HSU fibers was inversely correlated (R = -0.83) with thin filament density and directly correlated (R = 0.78) with thick-to-thin filament spacing distance in a nonlinear fashion. These data indicate that reduction in thin filament density contributes to an increased V0 in slow fibers. Osmotically compacting myofilaments with 5% dextran returned density, spacing, and specific tension and slowed V0 to near-control levels and provided evidence for myofilament spacing modulating tension and V0.",2005,288,2,C360-C365,,#4057,Riley 2005,NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal
1344,19724146.0,Disproportionate changes in skeletal muscle strength and size with resistance training and ageing.,Journal of musculoskeletal & neuronal interactions,"The ability of a muscle to shorten and produce force is crucial for locomotion, posture, balance and respiration. During a contraction, myosin heads on the myosin filament propel the actin filament via ATP hydrolysis, resulting in shortening of the muscle and/or force generation. The maximal shortening velocity of a muscle fibre is largely determined by the myosin ATPase activity, while maximal force is primarily determined by the cross-sectional area. Since most muscles are pennate rather than parallel-fibred and work at different lever ratios, muscle architecture and joint-tendon anatomy has to be taken into account to obtain the force and velocity characteristics of a muscle. Additionally, the recruitment of agonistic and antagonistic muscles will contribute to the torque generated during a contraction. Finally, tendon compliance may impact on the rate of force rise and force generated if it is such that the muscle contraction proceeds in the ascending limb of the length-tension relation. Even when magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound, combined with EMG and/or electrical stimulation, have been applied to relate changes in muscle contractile properties to alterations in muscle size and architecture during ageing and resistance training, a disproportionate change in muscle strength and size remains to be explained.",2009,9,3,123-9,,#4059,Degens 2009,

External compression might unload painful ligaments and joints, but the exact mechanical effect on pelvic structures, especially in (active) upright position, is still unknown. In the present study, a static three-dimensional (3-D) pelvic model was used to simulate compression at the level of anterior superior iliac spine and the greater trochanter. The model optimised forces in 100 muscles, 8 ligaments and 8 joints in upright trunk, pelvis and upper legs using a criterion of minimising maximum muscle stress. Initially, abdominal muscles, sacrotuberal ligaments and vertical sacroiliac joints (SIJ) shear forces mainly balanced a trunk weight of 500N in upright position. Application of 50N medial compression force at the anterior superior iliac spine (equivalent to 25N belt tension force) deactivated some dorsal hip muscles and reduced the maximum muscle stress by 37%. Increasing the compression up to 100N reduced the vertical SIJ shear force by 10% and increased SIJ compression force with 52%. Shifting the medial compression force of 100N in steps of 10N to the greater trochanter did not change the muscle activation pattern but further increased SIJ compression force by 40% compared to coxal compression. Moreover, the passive ligament forces were distributed over the sacrotuberal, the sacrospinal and the posterior ligaments. The findings support the cause-related designing of new pelvic belts to unload painful pelvic ligaments or muscles in upright posture.",2008,41,9,1878-1884,,#4061,Pel 2008,

Ultimately, the muscle wasting and weakness may dramatically impact on mobility and the quality of life, where the elderly has increasing problems with performing activities of daily life, such as rising from a chair or climbing stairs. The rate of structural and functional deterioration of muscle appears to vary considerably between people. Part of the variation in the 'rate of muscle ageing' is attributable to genetic factors, the timing of changes in circulating hormones and the presence or absence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. Where an individual cannot change much in his or her genetic constitution, circulating hormones and systemic inflammation, (s)he can still significantly slow the rate of muscle ageing by an adequate dietary intake and regular physical activity.

Training was carried out four times a week and consisted of six series of ten maximal isokinetic knee extensions at an angular velocity of 2.09 rad.s-1. At the start and at every 20th day of training and detraining, isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), integrated electromyographic activity (iEMG) and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) assessed at seven fractions of femur length (Lf), by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, were measured on both trained (T) and untrained (UT) legs. Isokinetic torques at 30 degrees before full knee extension were measured before and at the end of training at: 0, 1.05, 2.09, 3.14, 4.19, 5.24 rad.s-1. After 60 days T leg CSA had increased by 8.5% +/- 1.4% (mean +/- SEM, n = 4, p less than 0.001), iEMG by 42.4% +/- 16.5% (p less than 0.01) and MVC by 20.8% +/- 5.4% (p less than 0.01).

After training, the quadriceps cross-sectional area increased by 18.8 +/- 7.2% (P < 0.001) and 19.3 +/- 6.7% (P < 0.001) in the distal and proximal regions respectively, and by 13.0 +/- 7.2% (P < 0.001) in the central region of the muscle. Hypertrophy was significantly different between and within the four constituents of the quadriceps. Biopsies of the vastus lateralis at mid-thigh did not show any increase in mean fibre cross-sectional area. Maximum isometric voluntary torque increased by 29.6 +/- 7.9%-21.1 +/- 8.6% (P < 0.01-0.05) between 100 degrees and 160 degrees of knee extension, but no change in the optimum angle (110 degrees-120 degrees) for torque generation was found. A 12.0 +/- 10.8% (P < 0.02) increase in torque per unit area together with a right shift in the IEMG-torque relation and no change in maximum IEMG were observed. Time to peak isometric torque decreased by 45.8% (P < 0.03) but no change in time to maximum IEMG was observed. In conclusion, strength training of the quadriceps results in a variable hypertrophy of its components without affecting its angle-torque relation. The increase in torque per unit area, in the absence of changes in IEMG, may indicate changes in muscle architecture. An increase in muscle-tendon stiffness may account for the decrease in time to peak torque.",1996,157,2,175-186,,#4072,Narici 1996,

The purpose of this study was to evaluate shoulder muscle forces predicted by an electromyography-driven muscle model given neuromuscular parameters generated by Monte Carlo simulation. Normal distributions were used to model muscle moment arms; electromyographic and muscle physiological cross-sectional area data were modeled with log-normal distributions. Eight muscles were included in the model. Muscle force and joint moment were predicted on the basis of the simulated parameters. The results showed that the subscapularis and pectoralis major were substantial actuators for shoulder internal rotation. During maximum voluntary contraction the median of the muscle forces of the subscapularis and the pectoralis major were 1030 N and 462 N, respectively.

1356,11838580.0,"Skeletal muscle adaptations with age, inactivity, and therapeutic exercise",Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy,"One of the remarkable features of skeletal muscle is its adaptability. Skeletal muscle adaptations are characterized by modifications of morphological, biochemical, and molecular variables that alter the functional attributes of specific skeletal muscle fiber types. Skeletal muscle adaptation is diverse and the magnitude of change is dependent on many factors, such as activity pattern, age, and muscle fiber type composition. The adaptation of skeletal muscle in the adult population is well described. In contrast, the adaptation of skeletal muscle in the older population is less documented, especially in the area of inactivity-induced alterations. Age-related changes in skeletal muscle may play a significant role in the magnitude of change with inactivity and influence the rehabilitation process for the older adult. A consistent feature of age and inactivity is limb muscle atrophy and the loss of peak force and power. Differences exist in the rate and mechanisms of muscle wasting and in the susceptibility of a given fiber type to atrophy. Most likely, the rapid muscle wasting might be in part due to a decrease in protein synthesis coupled with an increased degradation. Besides the quantitative change in muscle mass, age and inactivity induce important qualitative changes in the structure of key skeletal muscle proteins that are manifested in alterations in contractile properties. Therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to identify the major effects of age and inactivity on skeletal muscle structure and function, and discuss potential therapeutic interventions. Special emphasis will be placed on how alterations in muscle structure affect function and on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the age-related and inactivity-induced muscle changes.",2002,32,2,44-57,,#4081,Thompson 2002,

In contrast, training caused no increase in maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength, electrically evoked knee extensor peak twitch torque, and knee extensor motor unit activation (interpolated twitch method). These data indicate that a moderate but significant amount of hypertrophy induced by weight training does not necessarily increase performance in an isometric strength task different from the training task but involving the same muscle group. The failure of evoked twitch torque to increase despite hypertrophy may further indicate that moderate hypertrophy in the early stage of strength training may not necessarily cause an increase in intrinsic muscle force generating capacity.",1992,64,1,51-55,,#4085,Sale 1992,

Muscle is considered to be in one of three states: resting (M(R)), activated (M(A)), or fatigued (M(F)). A bounded proportional controller represents muscle activation-deactivation, the transfer between M(R) and M(A). The fatigue and recovery rates determine the transfer to/from M(F) state. The model qualitatively demonstrates empirically based fatigue behavior, known as Rohmert's curves, with isometric loading conditions. An expanded version of the model utilizes the properties of three muscle fiber types and a last-in-first-out stack mechanism to represent the known muscle recruitment hierarchy. Additionally, a novel yet practical approach is introduced to quantitatively evaluate task-related muscle fatigue for complex and/or dynamic movements at the joint level, encompassing the nonlinear influences of joint angle and velocity.

One of the results that were focused on was the fiber phenotype modification and their loss. The physiological muscle recruitment to contraction, basically prosecuted under volitional control, can also be engaged by means of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES). Knowing that the NMES is effective in improving muscle strength in active healthy elderly, the aim was to investigate which physiological modifications were able to produce in the Vastus lateralis muscle and the pathways involved. It was found that NMES increased the cross sectional area and the isometric strength of type II myofibers together with the activated myogenic pathway in order to shift glycolytic toward the oxidative phenotype II myofibers, at a molecular level and with an increase of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) at a functional level. Using the TaqMan low density array on 48 different genes, we found that NMES specific gene regulation highlighted: (i) increased protein synthesis with respect to protein degradation; (ii) the activation of an apoptotic pathway involved in the differentiation process; (iii) increased regeneration signals; (iv) oxidative enzyme regulation. These pathways were validated via confirmatory RT-PCR for genes involved in the regeneration process as well as Myosin isoforms. We also investigated the oxidative stress status analyzing superoxide anion levels, the protein expression of two different superoxide dismutase and the activity of both catalase and superoxide anion dismutase, being two main antioxidant enzymes.

For each of these components, mechanistic (using basic contraction mechanisms) and phenomenological (""black-box"") models are available. Experiments on constant-velocity lengthening at different velocities were simulated using (a) a cross-bridge based model and (b) a Hill-based model. The Hill model was superior in its ability to predict muscle forces under different conditions with the same model parameters. Regarding force-length properties, myofilament overlap and muscle architecture did not correctly predict maximal isometric joint moments over the entire functional range of motion. The width of the force-length relationship of all contractile elements in a lower extremity model may be optimized to fit measured isometric moment-angle relationships. The resulting increase in width suggests that for some short-fibered muscles with complex architecture, the ""effective"" muscle fibre length is increased because muscle fibres may be partly connected in series as well as in parallel. It is concluded that a hybrid phenomenological/mechanistic muscle model is most likely to be practical (i.e. parameters can be estimated for human muscle) as well as accurate (i.e. correct forces are predicted for a wide range of conditions.",1998,8,2,119-124,,#4088,vandenBogert 1998,

Muscle twitch characteristics, ankle joint angle-twitch torque relation, frequency-torque relation, tetanic torque and fatigability were assessed before, during and after a 17-day Space Shuttle flight (STS-78). Muscle plus bone cross-sectional area (CSAm+b) was evaluated before and after the flight. Whereas no changes in muscle function were observed during the flight, marked alterations were found during the recovery period. Peak twitch (PTw) and tetanic torques at 50 Hz (PT50) continued to fall up to the 8th recovery day (R+8) on which losses in PTw and PT50 were 24.4% (P<0.01) and 22.0% (P<0.01), respectively. The decline in PTw was not joint-angle-specific. Post-flight, especially on R+8, torque decreased at all stimulation frequencies (1, 20, 30 and 50 Hz); however the shape of the frequency-torque curve, normalised for PT50, was not modified. Similarly, no changes in twitch kinetics were observed. Post- flight, an 8% (P<0.01) reduction in CSAm+b was found on R+2. Normalisation of PT50 values for CSAm+b showed a progressive loss in specific torque (PT50/CSAm+b), which was maximal on R+2 (19.5%, P<0.05). Also, fatigability during 2-min intermittent stimulation at 20 Hz increased throughout recovery, reaching a nadir of 16.4% (P<0.01) on R+15. In conclusion, 17 days of spaceflight resulted in significant changes in muscle function during the recovery phase, but not in microgravity.

After training, maximal leg extensor muscle force and vertical jump performance were improved 12% (P<0.01) and 13% (P<0.001), respectively. Single-fiber cross-sectional area increased 23% in type I (P<0.01), 22% in type IIa (P<0.001), and 30% in type IIa/IIx fibers (P<0.001). Peak force increased 19% in type I (P<0.01), 15% in type IIa (P<0.001), and 16% in type IIa/IIx fibers (P<0.001). When peak force was normalized with cross-sectional area, no changes were found for any fiber type. Maximal shortening velocity was increased 18, 29, and 22% in type I, IIa, and hybrid IIa/IIx fibers, respectively (P<0.001). Peak power was enhanced in all fiber types, and normalized peak power improved 9% in type IIa fibers (P<0.05). Fiber tension on passive stretch increased in IIa/IIx fibers only (P<0.05).

1364,15462613.0,Effects of aging on muscle fibre type and size,Sports medicine,"Aging has been associated with a loss of muscle mass that is referred to as 'sarcopenia'. This decrease in muscle tissue begins around the age of 50 years, but becomes more dramatic beyond the 60th year of life. Loss of muscle mass among the aged directly results in diminished muscle function. Decreased strength and power contribute to the high incidence of accidental falls observed among the elderly and can compromise quality of life. Moreover, sarcopenia has been linked to several chronic afflictions that are common among the aged, including osteoporosis, insulin resistance and arthritis. Loss of muscle fibre number is the principal cause of sarcopenia, although fibre atrophy--particularly among type II fibres--is also involved. Several physiological mechanisms have been implicated in the development of sarcopenia. Denervation results in the loss of motor units and thus, muscle fibres. A decrease in the production of anabolic hormones such as testosterone, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 impairs the capacity of skeletal muscle to incorporate amino acids and synthesise proteins. An increase in the release of catabolic agents, specifically interleukin-6, amplifies the rate of muscle wasting among the elderly. Given the demographic trends evident in most western societies, i.e. increased number of those considered aged, management interventions for sarcopenia must become a major goal of the healthcare profession.",2004,34,12,809-824,,#4095,Deschenes 2004, 
1365,33927161.0,A high-fat diet aggravates the age-related decline in skeletal muscle structure and function,Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews,The age-related decline in muscle function is aggravated by a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced increase in fat mass. The hypothesis is that an HFD leads to a faster accumulation of intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) and an earlier onset of muscle dysfunction in old than in young-adult individuals. The IMCL accumulation is attenuated in young-adult organisms by an elevated oxidative capacity. Methionine restriction enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and is promising to combat obesity across the ages.,2021,49,4,253-259,,#4096,Degens 2021,

1367,26113291.0,Factors that influence muscle shear modulus during passive stretch,Journal of biomechanics,"Although elastography has been increasingly used for evaluating muscle shear modulus associated with age, sex, musculoskeletal, and neurological conditions, its physiological meaning is largely unknown. This knowledge gap may hinder data interpretation, limiting the potential of using elastography to gain insights into muscle biomechanics in health and disease. We derived a mathematical model from a widely-accepted Hill-type passive force-length relationship to gain insight about the physiological meaning of resting shear modulus of skeletal muscles under passive stretching, and validated the model by comparing against the ex-vivo animal data reported in our recent work (Koo et al. 2013). The model suggested that resting shear modulus of a slack muscle is a function of specific tension and parameters that govern the normalized passive muscle force-length relationship as well as the degree of muscle anisotropy. The model also suggested that although the slope of the linear shear modulus-passive force relationship is primarily related to muscle anatomical cross-sectional area (i.e. the smaller the muscle cross-sectional area, the more the increase in shear modulus to result in the same passive muscle force), it is also governed by the normalized passive muscle force-length relationship and the degree of muscle anisotropy. Taken together, although muscle shear modulus under passive stretching has a strong linear relationship with passive muscle force, its actual value appears to be affected by muscle's mechanical, material, and architectural properties. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting the muscle shear modulus values.",2015,48,12,3539-3542,,#4098,Koo 2015,Elastography
1368,8248292.0,Motor unit recruitment and the gradation of muscle force,Physical therapy,"The capabilities of the different types of motor units are reviewed, and their properties in a variety of muscles are discussed. Because the tension-generating capacities of motor units are so different, the order in which they are recruited will have a strong influence on the way force output of the whole muscle is graded. Activation of motor units in a random order produces a roughly linear force increase with progressive recruitment, whereas recruitment of motor units in order of increasing force produces an approximately exponential force increase as the number of active motor units increases. The latter scheme allows fine control of weak movements and rapid production of powerful movements. Motor units are shown to be well adapted to the tasks they must perform, and a ""compromise"" motor unit will not fulfill all the tasks demanded of it. Finally, changes in motor unit properties produced by different activity patterns and by muscle reinnervation are reviewed, and the implications for rehabilitation are discussed.",1993,73,12,830-843,,#4100,Clamann 1993, 
1369,16475053.0,"Control of muscle size during disuse, disease, and aging",International journal of sports medicine,"Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue. For example, muscle hypertrophies during strength training and increases its oxidative capacity in response to endurance training. Conditions associated with disuse, however, are also accompanied by adaptations, of which atrophy and a slow-to-fast transition are most prominent. Fast and slow muscles respond differently to disuse. The different response of muscle to different models of disuse reveals that loading is most important, but that also activity level, neurotrophic factors, and ageing play a part in determining the mass, morphology, contractile properties, and fatigability of a muscle. Muscle loss during disuse is a result, at least in part, of apoptosis. Finally, skeletal muscle wasting and remodelling during ageing and chronic disorders, such as chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are not entirely attributable to disuse, but are also related to secondary consequences of the disease, most notably inflammation. Besides activating other pathways, we present evidence that inflammation during ageing and chronic disorders causes muscle wasting via alterations in abundance and/or activity of muscle specific transcription factors and induction of apoptosis, and that systemic inflammation rather than disuse is the primary cause of muscle wasting during ageing and chronic disorders.",2006,27,2,94-99,,#4101,Degens 2006,

The model is designed to predict forces in muscles spanning the glenohumeral joint resulting from functionally relevant tasks. The model is composed of four sub-models that comprise a mathematical as well as graphical three-dimensional representation of the upper extremity: a musculoskeletal model for estimation of muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms, a Hill-based muscle force model, a model for estimating optimal muscle lengths, and a model for estimation of muscle activation from EMG signal of the biceps. The purpose of this paper is to describe the components of the model, as well as the data required to drive the model. Collection of data is described in the context of applying the model to determine biceps muscle forces for testing of functional tasks.

The basic form of the present model is similar to many previous models of muscle energy expenditure, but parameter values were based almost entirely on mammalian muscle data, with preference given to human data where possible. Nonlinear phenomena associated with submaximal activation were also incorporated. The muscle energy model was evaluated at varying levels of complexity, ranging from simulated contractions of isolated muscle, to simulations of whole body locomotion. In all cases, acceptable agreement was found between simulated and experimental energy liberation.

1372,20200012.0,"Sarcopenia: characteristics, mechanisms and functional significance",British medical bulletin,"Sarcopenia reflects a progressive withdrawal of anabolism and an increased catabolism, along with a reduced muscle regeneration capacity. Muscle force and power decline more than muscle dimensions: older muscle is intrinsically weak. Sarcopenic obesity (SO) among the elderly corroborates to the loss of muscle mass increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome development. Recent studies on the musculoskeletal adaptations with ageing and key papers on the mechanisms of muscle wasting, its functional repercussions and on SO are included. Neuropathic, hormonal, immunological, nutritional and physical activity factors contribute to sarcopenia. Selective fast fibre atrophy, loss of motor units and an increase in hybrid fibres are typical findings of ageing. Satellite cell number decreases reducing muscle regeneration capacity. SO promotes further muscle wasting and increases risk of metabolic syndrome development. The proportion of fast to slow fibres seems maintained in old age. In elderly humans, nuclear domain is maintained constant. Basal protein synthesis and breakdown show little changes in old age. Instead, blunting of the anabolic response to feeding and exercise and of the antiproteolytic effect of insulin is observed. Further understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia requires disentangling of the effects of ageing alone from those of disuse and disease. The causes of the greater anabolic resistance to feeding and exercise of elderly women need elucidating. The enhancement of muscle regeneration via satellite cell activation via the MAPK/notch molecular pathways seems particularly promising.",2010,95,1,139-159,,#4104,Narici 2010,

Mice overexpressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) exhibit a proportional gain in muscle force and size, but not the myostatin-deficient mice. In an attempt to explore the role of the cytoplasmic volume supported by individual myonuclei [myonuclear domain (MND) size] on functional capacity of skeletal muscle, we have investigated specific force in relation to MND and the content of the molecular motor protein, myosin, at the single muscle fiber level from myostatin-knockout (Mstn(-/-)) and IGF-1-overexpressing (mIgf1(+/+)) mice. We hypothesize that the addition of extra myonuclei is a prerequisite for maintenance of specific force during muscle hypertrophy. A novel algorithm was used to measure individual MNDs in 3 dimensions along the length of single muscle fibers from the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus and the slow-twitch soleus muscle. A significant effect of the size of individual MNDs in hypertrophic muscle fibers on both specific force and myosin content was observed. This effect was muscle cell type specific and suggested there is a critical volume individual myonuclei can support efficiently. The large MNDs found in fast muscles of Mstn(-/-) mice were correlated with the decrement in specific force and myosin content in Mstn(-/-) muscles. Thus, myostatin inhibition may not be able to maintain the appropriate MND for optimal function.",2012,26,3,1077-1085,,#4108,Qaisar 2012,

Acta Physiol Scand 167: 233-239, 1999) possibly because of differences in muscle oxidative metabolism. We evaluated muscle fatigue produced by intermittent, maximal volitional isometric contractions of the dorsiflexor muscles of healthy young (21-34 yr) men (n = 8) and women (n = 8) under two conditions: free-flow (FF) circulation and ischemia. Measures of voluntary and stimulated (10- and 50-Hz) force, central activation ratio (CAR), and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) were collected in each session. The ischemic protocol induced greater fatigue than the FF protocol, in both sexes, and was associated with greater reductions in CAR, CMAP, stimulated force, and the ratio of 10- to 50-Hz force compared with the FF condition. Women fatigued less than men in FF but not during ischemia, and this difference was roughly paralleled by a difference in CAR. No sex effects on the CMAP, tetanic force, and measures of excitation-contraction coupling function were found in the FF condition, suggesting that the primary mechanism behind the difference in fatigue was a relatively greater impairment of central activation in men. The observation that ischemia eliminated the sex differences in fatigue is consistent with a number of studies (Kent-Braun JA, Ng AV, Doyle JW, and Towse TF. J Appl Physiol 93: 1813-1823, 2002) relating fatigue to muscle metabolism and might be the result of sex-based differences in metabolic pathway utilization during muscle contraction.",2001,29,3,109-112,,#4115,Hicks 2001,

Fiber types were classified according to the histochemical myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase technique at a basic pH. Maximal extensor troques were recorded at 30 degrees from full extension at four selected velocities. While results confirm earlier reports on muscle fiber type and performance, an additional finding was that as knee extension velocities increased from 0 to 95 degrees/s angle specific extensor torque production did not decline as seen in in vitro muscle preparations. The difference in extensor torque between 0 and 96 degrees/s appeared far more critical than the differences observed between 96 and 288 degrees/s. Significant differences in torque were seen at 96, 192, and 288 degrees/s in thos with greater than 50% and less than 50% slow-twitch fibers. When expressed per kilogram of body weight the subjects with greater than 50% fast-twitch fiber produced the greatest torque at 192 degrees/s. These results suggest that the velocity at which torque begins to decline in vivo is related to the proportion of slow-twitch fibers in the vastus lateralismuscle.",1979,47,2,388-392,,#4118,Gregor 1979,

1382,18927270.0,Calf muscle strength in humans,International journal of sports medicine,"Not much is known about the effects of immobilization and subsequent recovery on tendon connective tissue. In the present study, healthy young men had their nondominant leg immobilized for a 2-wk period, followed by a recovery period of the same length. Immobilization resulted in a mean decrease of 6% (5,413 to 5,077 mm(2)) in cross-sectional area (CSA) of the triceps surae muscles and a mean decrease of 9% (261 to 238 N.m) in strength of the immobilized calf muscles. Two weeks of recovery resulted in a 6% increased in CSA (to 5,367 mm(2)), whereas strength remained suppressed (240 N.m). No difference in Achilles tendon CSA was detected between the two legs at any time point. Local tendon collagen synthesis, measured as the peritendinous concentrations of PINP (NH(2)-terminal propeptide of type I collagen; indirect marker for collagen synthesis), was unchanged after 2 wk of immobilization. However, peritendinous levels of PINP were significantly elevated in the immobilized leg (15 to 139 ng/ml) following 2 wk of remobilization compared with preimmobilization levels. In contradiction hereto, systemic concentrations of PINP remained unchanged throughout the study. Immobilization reduced muscle size and strength, while tendon size and collagen turnover were unchanged. While recovery resulted in an increase in muscle size, strength was unchanged. No significant difference in tendon size could be detected between the two legs after 2 wk of recovery, although collagen synthesis was increased in the previously immobilized leg. Thus 2 wk of immobilization are sufficient to induce significant changes in muscle tissue, whereas tendon tissue seems to be more resistant to short-term immobilization.",2001,22,3,186-191,,#4124,Trappe 2001,

Subjects were 10 non-obese (14.6% fat) and 11 obese (32.3% fat) males matched for age (15-18 years), level of maturity (Tanner stages IV and V), lean body mass, and height. Peak torque (PT) was measured during maximal voluntary isometric (IS) and isokinetic (IK) knee extension (KE). Peak twitch torque (TT), time to peak torque (TPT), and half-relaxation time (HRT) of the knee extensors were elicited by percutaneous electrical stimulation. The interpolated twitch technique was used to determine the extent of motor unit activation (% MUA) during maximal voluntary IS KE. Knee extensor cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined by computed axial tomography taken at the mid-thigh. All strength and area measurements were made on the right side of the body. Obese subjects had significantly (P less than 0.05) lower maximal voluntary IS and IK KE strength normalized for body weight, and significantly lower % MUA during IS KE. There were no significant differences (P greater than 0.05) between groups for absolute or normalized (for the product of muscle CSA and height) ISPT, IKPT, and TT, knee extensor CSA, or TPT and HRT. These results suggest that reduced MUA and a lower strength per mass ratio (due to excess fat) are probably important contributing factors to the poorer motor performances of the obese, especially for complex motor tasks involving large muscle groups and the support or moving of body weight.",1990,61,3,313-318,,#4129,Blimkie 1990,

Each subject's whole muscle strength (1 repetition maximum, or 1RM) and whole muscle size (determined by computed tomography scan) were measured before (T1) and after (T2) 12 weeks of PRT and again following 6 months (T3) of training (TR) or detraining (DT). During the 12-week PRT, older men (N = 10; age 70 +/- 4 years) trained their knee extensors 3 days per week at 80% of their 1RM. The maintenance program consisted of older men (n = 5; TR; 75 +/- 1 years) who completed 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 80% of their 1RM 1 day per week (this was equivalent to a single training session that was performed 3 days per week during the 12-week PRT). The other group of older men (n = 5; DT; 69 +/- 1 years) resumed their normal lifestyle (no regular physical activity) following the 12-week PRT.

Muscle size demonstrated a similar pattern with a 7% increase (p <.05) in both groups from T1 to T2. No change in muscle size was found in the TR group from T2 to T3, whereas the DT group had a 5% reduction (p <.05). These data indicate that resistance training 1 day per week was sufficient to maintain muscle strength and size in these older men following a 12-week PRT program.

1387,2050705.0,A comparison of the triceps surae and residual muscle moments at the ankle during cycling,Journal of biomechanics,"The rigid linked system model and principles of inverse dynamics have been widely used to calculate residual muscle moments during various activities. EMG driven models and optimization algorithms have also been presented in the literature in efforts to estimate skeletal muscle forces and evaluate their possible contribution to the residual muscle moment. Additionally, skeletal muscle-tendon forces have been measured, directly, in both animals and humans. The purpose of this investigation was to calculate the moment produced by the triceps surae muscles and compare it to the residual muscle moment at the ankle during cycling at three power outputs (90, 180 and 270 W). Inferences were made regarding the potential contribution made by each triceps surae component to the tendon force using EMG and muscle-tendon length changes. A buckle-type transducer was surgically implanted on the right Achilles tendon of one male subject. Achilles tendon forces measured in vivo were multiplied by their corresponding moment arms to yield the triceps surae moment during the three working conditions. Moment arm lengths were obtained in a separate experiment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pedal reaction forces, body segment accelerations (determined from high speed film), and appropriate mass parameters served as input to the inverse solution. The triceps surae moment was temporally in phase with and consistently represented approximately 65% of the residual muscle moment at the ankle. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using implanted transducers in human subjects and provide a greater understanding of musculoskeletal mechanics during normal human movements.",1991,24,5,287-297,,#4134,Gregor 1991, 
1388,,Influence of muscle architecture on the torque and power–velocity characteristics of young and elderly men,European journal of applied physiology,"This study investigated the contribution of muscle architecture to the differences in the torque-velocity and power-velocity relationships between older (OM n = 9, aged 69-82 years) and younger men (YM n = 15, aged 19-35 years). Plantarflexors' (PF) maximal isometric and concentric torques were recorded at 0.87, 1.75, 2.62, 3.49 and 4.36 rad s(-1). Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was calculated as the ratio of muscle volume (determined by magnetic resonance imaging) to muscle fascicle length (Lf, measured by ultrasonography). GM PCSA and Lf of the OM were, respectively, 14.3% (P < 0.05) and 19.3% (P < 0.05) smaller than of the YM. In the OM, GM maximum isometric torque and maximum contraction velocity (Vmax), estimated from Hill's equation were, respectively, 48.5 and 38.2% lower (P < 0.001) than in the YM. At all contraction velocities, the OM produced less torque than the YM (46.3% of YM at 0.87 rad s(-1) to 14.7% at 4.36 rad s(-1), P < 0.001). Peak power (PP) of the OM was 80% lower than that of the YM and normalisation of PP to muscle volume only reduced this difference by 10%. Normalisation of torque to PCSA reduced, but did not eliminate, differences in torque between YM and OM (9.6%) and differences in torque/PCSA increased with contraction velocity (P < 0.05). After normalisation of velocity to Lf, the difference in Vmax between the OM and the YM was reduced to 15.9%. Thus, although muscle architecture contributes significantly to the differences in the torque- and power-velocity properties of OM and YM, other contractile factors, intrinsic to the muscle, seem to play a role. It is noteworthy that the deficit in PP between OM and YM is far greater than that of muscle torque, even after normalisation of PP to muscle volume. This finding likely plays an important role in the loss of mobility in old age.",2007,100,5,613-619,,#4136,Thom 2007,
1389,,Using Hill-type muscle models and EMG data in a forward dynamic analysis of joint moment: Evaluation of critical parameters,Journal of Mechanics in Medicine and Biology,"from EMG signals, but most approaches have not been very successful. This is largely because robust models of muscle activation dynamics, Hill-type muscle contraction dynamics, and musculoskeletal geometry are generally not included. Here we present a model which includes these sub-models and we determine which model parameters are most important. The models abilities to predict joint moments about the human elbow during time-varying isometric tasks were examined. Inputs to the models were EMGs from eight muscles. Joint moment was the output, which was compared with the measured moment. Models varied in complexity, having up to 59 adjustable parameters. It was found that a seven adjustable parameter model could adequately estimate time-varying joint moments without substantial sacrifice in performance. The key parameters that were fit for each subject were two global gain factors, a time delay term, a non-linear EMG-force term, two muscle activation terms, and a term for skewing the length-tension curve with muscle activation. This approach offers advantages over optimization-based methods for estimating individual muscle forces. Most importantly, it accounts for the way muscles are activated, which makes it potentially powerful to evaluate patients with pathologies.",2003,3,2,169-186,,#4137,Heine 2003,

1391,23666342.0,Skeletal muscle adaptations to physical inactivity and subsequent retraining in young men,Biogerontology,"Skeletal muscle structure and function are markedly affected by chronic disuse. With unloading, muscle mass is lost at rate of about 0.4 %/day but little is known about the recovery of muscle mass and strength following disuse. Here we report an extensive data set describing in detail skeletal muscle adaptations in structure and function in response to both disuse and retraining. Eight young men (23 ± 2.2 years) underwent 3 weeks of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) followed by a 3-week resistance training recovery program. Knee extensor isometric torque, voluntary activation, quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle volume (QFvol), fascicle length (Lf) and pennation angle (θ), physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of all four heads of the QF muscle, were measured before, after ULLS, and post-ULLS-resistance training. Needle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of a subgroup (n = 6) of the same subjects and cross sectional area of individual muscle s and myosin content of muscle samples were determined. Following 3 weeks of ULLS, isometric torque decreased by 26 %, PCSA by 3 %, QFvol by 10 %. Lf and θ of all four heads of QF significantly decreased (p ≤ 0.05). Following the 3-week retraining period, isometric torque, PCSA, QFvol, Lf and θ of all four heads of QF were all fully restored to pre ULLS values. CSA of individual muscle fibres and myosin content of muscle samples decreased by 26 and 35 % respectively (post-ULLS) and recovered to almost pre-ULLS values following retraining. There were no significant changes in voluntary activation of the quadriceps muscles in response to either ULLS or subsequent retraining. These results indicate that: (1) the loss of muscle force with 3-week unloading in humans is mostly explained by muscle atrophy and by a decrease in myosin content and, (2) all the neuromuscular changes induced by this model of disuse can be fully restored after a resistance training intervention of equal duration.",2013,14,3,247-259,,#4139,Campbell 2013, 
1392,16469817.0,Myotendinous plasticity to ageing and resistance exercise in humans,Experimental physiology,"The age-related loss of muscle mass known as senile sarcopenia is one of the main determinants of frailty in old age. Molecular, cellular, nutritional and hormonal mechanisms are at the basis of sarcopenia and are responsible for a progressive deterioration in skeletal muscle size and function. Both at single-fibre and at whole-muscle level, the loss of force exceeds that predicted by the decrease in muscle size. For single fibres, the loss of intrinsic force is mostly due to a loss in myofibrillar protein content. For whole muscle, in addition to changes in neural drive, alterations in muscle architecture and in tendon mechanical properties, exemplified by a reduction in tendon stiffness, have recently been shown to contribute to this phenomenon. Resistance training can, however, cause substantial gains in muscle mass and strength and provides a protective effect against several of the cellular and molecular changes associated with muscle wasting and weakness. In old age, not only muscles but also tendons are highly responsive to training, since an increase in tendon stiffness has been observed after a period of increased loading. Many of the myotendinous factors characterizing ageing can be at least partly reversed by resistance training.",2006,91,3,483-498,,#4140,Reeves 2006,

Improving the efficiency of gait can be facilitated by knowing which muscles are affected and how they contribute to the pathological pattern. In this paper we present an electromyographically (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model to estimate muscle forces and joint moments. Subject specific EMG for the primary ankle plantar and dorsiflexor muscles, and joint kinematics during walking for four subjects following stroke were used as inputs to the model to predict ankle joint moments during stance. The model's ability to predict the joint moment was evaluated by comparing the model output with the moment computed using inverse dynamics. The model did predict the ankle moment with acceptable accuracy, exhibiting an average R(2) value ranging between 0.87 and 0.92, with RMS errors between 9.7% and 14.7%. The values are in line with previous results for healthy subjects, suggesting that EMG-driven modeling in this population of patients is feasible. It is our hope that such models can provide clinical insight into developing more effective rehabilitation therapies and to assess the effects of an intervention.",2009,39,12,1083-1088,,#4141,Shao 2009,

The aim of this study was to explore the sensitivity of the aforementioned techniques in detecting a change in passive mechanical properties of the biceps femoris (BF) muscle as a result of change in knee joint angle (i.e. muscle length). BF responses were assessed in 16 young participants (23.4 ± 4.9 years), at three knee joint angles (0°, 45° and 90°), for maximal isometric torque (MIT) along with myo-electrical activity. Contractile and mechanical properties were measured in a relaxed state. Inter-day reliability of the TMG and MMT was also assessed. MIT changed significantly (p < 0.01) across the three angles, so did stiffness and other parameters measured with MMT (p < 0.01). Conversely, TMG could detect changes only at two knee angles (0° and 45°, p < 0.01), when there is enough tension in the muscle. Reliability was overall insufficient for TMG whilst absolute reliability was excellent (coefficient of variation < 5%) for MMT. The ability of MMT more than TMG to detect an inherent change in stiffness can be conceivably exploited in a number of clinical/therapeutic applications that have to do with unnatural changes in passive muscle stiffness.",2011,32,8,1315,,#4142,Ditroilo 2011,

Postmenopausal women experience a greater decline than men of similar age in parallel with the decrease in female sex steroid hormone production. We recruited six monozygous female twin pairs (55-59 years old) where only one twin pair was on hormone replacement therapy (HRT use = 7.8 ± 4.3 years) to investigate the association of HRT with the cytoplasmic volume supported by individual myonuclei (myonuclear domain (MND) size,) together with specific force at the single fibre level. HRT use was associated with a significantly smaller (∼27%; P < 0.05) mean MND size in muscle fibres expressing the type I but not the IIa myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform. In comparison to non-users, higher specific force was recorded in HRT users both in muscle fibres expressing type I (∼27%; P < 0.05) and type IIa (∼23%; P < 0.05) MyHC isoforms. These differences were fibre-type dependent, i.e. the higher specific force in fast-twitch muscle fibres was primarily caused by higher force per cross-bridge while slow-twitch fibres relied on both a higher number and force per cross-bridge. HRT use had no effect on fibre cross-sectional area (CSA), velocity of unloaded shortening (V0) and relative proportion of MyHC isoforms. In conclusion, HRT appears to have significant positive effects on both regulation of muscle contraction and myonuclei organization in postmenopausal women.",2013,591,9,2333-2344,,#4143,Qaisar 2013, 
1396,9796690.0,Lumbar muscle force estimation using a subject-invariant 5-parameter EMG-based model,Journal of biomechanics,"The use of electromyographic measures, in concert with modeled or empirical representations of muscle physiology, is a common approach for estimation of muscle force. Existing models of the lumbar musculature have allowed model parameters to vary for an individual subject. While this approach improves apparent predictive ability, it loses some degree of construct validity since parameter variability may not be physiologically justifiable. An EMG-based five-parameter model, adapted and generalized from earlier reports, is presented here. Inherent in the model is the requirement of subject-invariant modeling parameters. As a practical analysis tool was desired, the model relies on relatively few calibration constants whose determination is described. Empirical evaluation was undertaken using a database of 398 experimental trials involving lifting and transferring objects of moderate mass. Model performance, evaluated by comparison of measured and predicted lumbar moments, was comparable to earlier models, with r2 mean (S.D.) values of 0.76(0.15) for sagittal plane moments, and rms mean (S.D.) errors of 14.1(7.4), 9.7(5.3), and 8.6(3.6) Nm in the sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes, respectively.

1397,10412442.0,Muscular resistance to varus and valgus loads at the elbow,J Biomechanical Engineering,"Although the contributions of passive structures to stability of the elbow have been well documented, the role of active muscular resistance of varus and valgus loads at the elbow remains unclear. We hypothesized that muscles: (1) can produce substantial varus and valgus moments about the elbow, and (2) are activated in response to sustained varus and valgus loading of the elbow. To test the first hypothesis, we developed a detailed musculoskeletal model to estimate the varus and valgus moment-generating capacity of the muscles about the elbow. To test the second hypothesis, we measured EMGs from 11 muscles in four subjects during a series of isometric tasks that included flexion, extension, varus, and valgus moments about the elbow. The EMG recordings were used as inputs to the elbow model to estimate the contributions of individual muscles to flexion-extension and varus-valgus moments. Analysis of the model revealed that nearly all of the muscles that cross the elbow are capable of producing varus or valgus moments; the capacity of the muscles to produce varus moment (34 Nm) and valgus moment (35 Nm) is roughly half of the maximum flexion moment (70 Nm). Analysis of the measured EMGs showed that the anconeus was the most significant contributor to valgus moments and the pronator teres was the largest contributor to varus moments. Although our results show that muscles were activated in response to static varus and valgus loads, their activations were modest and were not sufficient to balance the applied load.",1998,120,5,634-639,,#4145,Buchanan 1998,

Ten men (23.2 +/- 3.6 years) and 10 women (21.8 +/- 2.7 years) performed 2 trials consisting of seven exercises: bench press (BP), leg press, latissimus dorsi pull down, triceps press, biceps curl, shoulder press, and calf raise. The HIP and LIP protocols were completed in counterbalanced order. During HIP, subjects completed 5 repetitions using 90% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM). RPE-AM was measured after every repetition. During LIP, subjects completed 15 repetitions using 30% of 1RM. RPE-AM was measured after every third repetition. RPE-AMs were greater (p <or= 0.001) for HIP than for LIP for each exercise. For example, the mean initial BP RPE was 14.11 +/- 2.08 for the HIP and 8.34 +/- 1.35 for the LIP.

We examined the effects of low-intensity cycle exercise training with and without blood flow restriction (BFR) on muscle size and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). A group of 19 young men (mean age ± SD: 23.0 ± 1.7 years) were allocated randomly into either a BFR-training group (n=9, BFR-training) or a non-BFR control training group (n=10, CON-training), both of which trained 3 days/wk for 8 wk. Training intensity and duration were 40% of VO2max and 15 min for the BFR-training group and 40% of VO2max and 45 min for the CON-training group. MRI-measured thigh and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area and muscle volume increased by 3.4-5.1% (P < 0.01) and isometric knee extension strength tended to increase by 7.7% (p < 0.10) in the BFR-training group. There was no change in muscle size (~0.6%) and strength (~1.4%) in the CON-training group. Significant improvements in VO2max (6.4%) and exercise time until exhaustion (15.4%) were observed in the BFR-training group (p < 0.05) but not in the CON-training group (-0.1 and 3. 9%, respectively). The results suggest that low-intensity, short-duration cycling exercise combined with BFR improves both muscle hypertrophy and aerobic capacity concurrently in young men. Key pointsConcurrent improvements in aerobic capacity and muscle hypertrophy in response to a single mode of training have not been reported.In the present study, low-intensity (40% of VO2max) cycle training with BFR can elicit concurrent improvement in muscle hypertrophy and aerobic capacity.",2010,9,3,452,,#4148,Abe 2010,Aerobic exercise
1400,10932036.0,Short-term training: when do repeated bouts of resistance exercise become training?,Canadian journal of applied physiology,"Chronic resistance training induces increases in muscle fibre cross-sectional area (CSA), otherwise known as hypertrophy. This is due to an increased volume percentage of myofibrillarproteins within a given fibre. The exact time-course for muscle fibre hypertrophy is not well-documented but appears to require at least 6-7 weeks of regular resistive training at reasonably high intensity before increases in fibre CSA are deemed significant. Proposed training-induced changes in neural drive are hypothesized to increase strength due to increased synchrony of motor unit firing, reducedant agonist muscle activity, and/or a reduction in any bilateral strength deficit. Nonetheless, increases in muscle protein synthesis were observed following an isolated bout of resistance exercise. In addition, muscle balance was positive, following resistance exercise when amino acids were infused/ingested. This showed that protein accretion occurred during the postexercise period. The implications of this hypothesis for training-induced increases in strength are discussed.",2000,25,3,185-193,,#4149,Phillips 2000,

The aim was to study the reliability and validity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify muscle sizes and moment arms by MRI and to test selected anthropometric measures as predictors of muscle sizes and moment arms. A total of 20 healthy Scandinavian women (age 22-58 years) participated in an MRI scanning of their dominant shoulder. With a PC-based program the reliability and the validity of the MRI measurements was estimated to be high, and mean anatomical cross-sectional areas (ACSA) and muscle lengths were measured to be 4.0, 9.8 and 12.1 cm(2) and 12.0, 12.6 and 12.8 cm for m. supraspinatus, m. infraspinatus and m. subscapularis, respectively. Volumes were calculated to be 48.8, 125.1 and 153.6 cm(3). Moment arms were measured with the upper arm in a neutral position and in a functional position of 34 degrees abduction for m. supraspinatus only, and were 2.4 and 2.6 cm. Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and its fiber force component were estimated from dissected fiber length and pennation angle. MRI volume and PCSA were 1.4-1.7 times higher than dissection data, primarily because of age differences.

Neuropathic pain is highly prevalent in PD and negatively affects the quality of life of patients with PD. However, there is currently no evidence-based treatment for its control. Safinamide, a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor with a sodium channel inhibitory effect, showed improvement in PD-related pain in several clinical trials. However, it is unclear for which of the various types of pain in PD safinamide is effective. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of safinamide on neuropathic pain in a rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI). Pain was evaluated on postoperative days 14 and 21 using von Frey or weight-bearing tests. Male CCI model rats showed a decreased paw withdrawal threshold and a weight-bearing deficit on postoperative days 14 and 21. Single oral administration of safinamide (15, 30, 45 or 70 mg/kg) dose-dependently improved neuropathic pain in both pain assessments on day 14. Subsequently, the 15 and 45 mg/kg dose groups were administered safinamide orally once daily until day 21. With repeated administration, the effect of safinamide on pain was enhanced. The present findings show that safinamide improves neuropathic pain in male CCI model rats.

When multiple muscles act on a single joint, the nature of the relationship between the neural drive and force-generating capacity of the synergistic muscles is largely unknown. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the ratio of neural drive and the ratio of muscle force-generating capacity between two synergist muscles (vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM)) in humans. Twenty-one participants performed isometric knee extensions at 20 and 50% of maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). Myoelectric activity (surface electromyography (EMG)) provided an index of neural drive. Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was estimated from measurements of muscle volume (magnetic resonance imaging) and muscle fascicle length (three-dimensional ultrasound imaging) to represent the muscles' force-generating capacities. Neither PCSA nor neural drive was balanced between VL and VM. There was a large (r = 0.68) and moderate (r = 0.43) correlation between the ratio of VL/VM EMG amplitude and the ratio of VL/VM PCSA at 20 and 50% of MVC, respectively. This study provides evidence that neural drive is biased by muscle force-generating capacity, the greater the force-generating capacity of VL compared with VM, the stronger bias of drive to the VL.",2015,282,1819,20151908,,#4152,Hug 2015,electromyography

The rate of muscle deoxygenation (using near-infrared spectroscopy), and the rate of muscle fatigue (using the slope of integrated electromyography, iEMG) were evaluated concurrently. Nine healthy subjects performed submaximal (50% maximal voluntary contraction. MVC) static knee extension at 50 degrees (extended position, EXT) and 90 degrees (flexed position, FLEX) joint angles until the target torque could no longer be maintained: that time was measured as the endurance time. They exercised with the circulation occluded (OCCL), and without (FREE) to study the possible effects of the local circulation. Although MVC torque was independent of joint angle [mean (SD) FLEX 250.6 (51.7) Nm and EXT 246.5 (46.6) N x m], significantly shorter (P<0.01) endurance time in FLEX [FREE 71.1 (10) s and OCCL 63.1 (8.8) s] than at EXT [FREE 115.3 (30) s and OCCL 106.7 (29.1) s] were obtained in both circulatory conditions. The iEMG-time slope was significantly greater in FLEX at the proximal and distal portion (P<0.05) in both circulatory conditions. Muscle deoxygenation rate in OCCL was significantly greater (P<0.05) at FLEX [20.8 (8.0)%] than EXT [10.9 (4.0)%]. The results would suggest that different knee-joint angle affects muscle endurance even if the local circulation is controlled. Circulatory disturbance would further reduce muscle endurance in EXT, but not in FLEX. Because of the greater muscle internal force in FLEX, local blood flow might be already limited even with a free circulation. The greater muscle deoxygenation and muscle fatigability would be related to the shorter muscle endurance in FLEX.",2001,86,1,17-23,,#4153,Hisaeda 2001,

To compare the influence of age and gender on MQ response to ST and detraining, 11 young men (20-30 years), nine young women (20-30 years), 11 older men (65-75 years), and 11 older women (65-75 years), were assessed for quadriceps MQ at baseline, after 9 weeks of ST, and after 31 weeks of detraining. MQ was calculated by dividing quadriceps one repetition maximum (IRM) strength by quadriceps muscle volume determined by magnetic resonance imaging. All groups demonstrated significant increases in IRM strength and muscle volume after training (all p < .05). All groups also increased their MQ with training (all p < .01), but the gain in MQ was significantly greater in young women than in the other three groups (p < .05). After 31 weeks of detraining, MQ values remained significantly elevated above baseline levels in all groups (p < .05), except the older women. These results indicate that factors other than muscle mass contribute to strength gains with ST in young and older men and women, but those other factors may account for a higher portion of the strength gains in young women. These factors continue to maintain strength levels above baseline for up to 31 weeks after cessation of training in young men and women, and in older men.",2000,55,3,B152-B157,,#4154,Ivey 2000, 
1406,14571465.0,Role of intertendinous connections in distribution of force in the human extensor digitorum muscle,Muscle & nerve,"The human extensor digitorum (ED) muscle gives rise distally to multiple tendons that insert onto and extend digits 2-5. It has been shown previously that the spike-triggered average forces of motor units in ED are broadly distributed across many tendons. Such force dispersion may result from linkages between the distal tendons of ED and may limit the ability to move the fingers independently. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the extent to which the connections between tendons of ED distribute force across the fingers. Stimulation of ED muscle fibers was performed at 107 different sites in four subjects. The isometric force exerted on digits 2-5 resulting from the stimulation was measured separately. Stimulus-triggered averaging of each of the four force channels yielded the force contribution to each of the digits due to the stimulation at each site. A selectivity index from 0 (a site that distributes force equally across the fingers) to 1.0 (a site that produces force on a single finger) was computed to describe the distribution of force across the four fingers. The selectivity index resulting from electrical stimulation of ED averaged 0.70 +/- 0.21. These selectivity index values were significantly greater (P < 0.001) than those obtained for single motor units using spike-triggered averaging. These findings suggest that linkages between the distal tendons of ED probably play only a minor role in distributing force across the fingers and, therefore, other factors must be primarily responsible for the inability to move the fingers independently.",2003,28,5,614-622,,#4155,Keen 2003,

1408,29975603.0,Coordination of hamstrings is individual specific and is related to motor performance,Journal of Applied Physiology,"The torque-sharing strategies between synergistic muscles may have important functional consequences. This study involved two experiments. The first experiment ( n = 22) aimed 1) to determine the relationship between the distribution of activation and the distribution of torque-generating capacity among the heads of the hamstring, and 2) to describe individual torque-sharing strategies and to determine whether these strategies are similar between legs. The second experiment ( n = 35) aimed to determine whether the distribution of activation between the muscle heads affects endurance performance during a sustained submaximal knee flexion task. Surface electromyography (EMG) was recorded from biceps femoris (BF), semimembranosus (SM), and semitendinosus (ST) during submaximal isometric knee flexions. Torque-generating capacity was estimated by measuring muscle volume, fascicle length, pennation angle, and moment arm. The product of the normalized EMG amplitude and the torque-generating capacity was used as an index of muscle torque. The distributions of muscle activation and of torque-generating capacity were not correlated significantly (all P > 0.18). Thus, there was a torque imbalance between the muscle heads (ST torque > BF and SM torque; P < 0.001), the magnitude of which varied greatly between participants. A significant negative correlation was observed between the imbalance of activation across the hamstring muscles and the time to exhaustion ( P < 0.001); i.e., the larger the imbalance of activation across muscles, the lower the muscle endurance performance. Torque-sharing strategies between the heads of the hamstrings are individual specific and related to muscle endurance performance. Whether these individual strategies play a role in hamstring injury remains to be determined. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The distribution of activation among the heads of the hamstring is not related to the distribution of torque-generating capacity. The torque-sharing strategies within hamstring muscles vary greatly between individuals but are similar between legs. Hamstring coordination affects endurance performance; i.e., the larger the imbalance of activation across the muscle heads, the lower the muscle endurance.",2018,125,4,1069-1079,,#4157,Avrillon 2018,hamstring
1409,,"Neuromuscular electrical stimulation: specific tension, muscle fatigue and its clinical implications",Thesis,"These studies examined the effects of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (SNMES) control components, pulse duration, frequency of the pulses and amplitude of the current, on specific tension (ST) and muscle fatigue. The outcome of a SNMES protocol used in research was also compared to a common rehabilitation protocol. Magnetic resonance images of both thighs were acquired prior to and after SNMES to determine the area of stimulated muscle. Fatigue was assessed by the decline in torque during 3-5 minutes of SNMES. One of five SNMES protocols was applied to either knee extensor muscle group to induce isometric actions. The amplitude of current that evoked torque equal to 45% or 75% of maximum voluntary 2isometric torque did not alter ST, 25 N/cm. Increasing the pulse duration from 150 to 450 s 2caused ST to increase from 20 to 25 N/cm. Increasing the frequency from 25 to 100 Hz 2increased ST from 17 to 25 N/cm by increasing the evoked torque. ST using the activated area 2vs. assuming the whole muscle area was recruited was 25 vs. 15 N/cm. Increasing the frequency from 25 to 100 Hz increased fatigue from 39 to 76%. Increasing the pulse duration and the amplitude of the current did not. The results suggest that the frequency but not the amplitude of current nor pulse duration of SNMES affects fatigue. ST was double for the research protocol (RP) compared to the rehabilitation protocol (REH P). REH P did not show maintenance of torque at the beginning or end of the 10 sec contractions over the 5 min. Torque decreased 31% and 50%, respectively. Nonetheless, overall fatigue was lower in REH P compared to the RP. These results suggest that 1) ST is higher using the activated area vs. assuming the whole muscle area was recruited, 2) The amplitude does not alter ST, 3) increasing the frequency of SNMES increases ST, 4) The pulse duration modestly increases ST, 5) fatigue during SNMES is dependent on the frequency of the pulses and 6) the REH P was not designed to optimize ST, but it elicited less muscle fatigue than RP.",2005,,,,,#4158,Gorgey 2005,

Young and older women performed concentric (CON) and ECC one repetition maximum (1 RM) strength tests of the quadriceps femoris. Older women also performed knee extension training for 12 weeks. An unaccustomed bout of ECC knee extension exercise was performed before and after training, and CON and ECC 1 RM were reassessed for 11 days after the ECC bout. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate changes in muscle water content associated with muscle damage. Before training, older subjects showed a larger decline in CON (p =.008) and ECC (p =.03) strength induced by the unaccustomed ECC bout, compared with the young subjects. One day following the ECC bout, the older women showed a 24% reduction in CON and a 27% reduction in ECC 1 RM, compared with only 6% (CON) and 10% (ECC) in the younger women. A magnetic resonance imaging evaluation indicated that edema or damage was significantly greater in the older untrained women than it was in young women (p <.05), but the resistance-trained older women showed no greater muscle injury than the young women (p >.05). Resistance-trained older women showed no greater decline than sedentary young women in either CON (p >.05) or ECC (p >.05) strength. In conclusion, sedentary older women are more susceptible to ECC-induced muscle dysfunction, but resistance training reduces this susceptibility.",2001,56,9,B384-B390,,#4161,Ploutz-Snyder 2001, 
1412,22773532.0,Matching initial torque with different stimulation parameters influences skeletal muscle fatigue.,Journal of Rehabilitation Research & Development,"A fundamental barrier to using electrical stimulation in the clinical setting is an inability to maintain torque production secondary to muscle fatigue. Electrical stimulation parameters are manipulated to influence muscle torque production, and they may also influence fatigability during repetitive stimulation. Our purpose was to determine the response of the quadriceps femoris to three different fatigue protocols using the same initial torque obtained by altering stimulator parameter settings. Participants underwent fatigue protocols in which either pulse frequency (lowHz), pulse duration (lowPD), or voltage (lowV) was manipulated to obtain an initial torque that equaled 25% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction. Muscle soreness was reported on a visual analog scale 48 h after each fatigue test. The lowHz protocol resulted in the least fatigue (25% +/- 14%); the lowPD (50% +/- 13%) and lowV (48% +/- 14%) protocols had similar levels of fatigue. The lowHz protocol resulted in significantly less muscle soreness than the higher frequency protocols. Stimulation protocols that use a lower frequency coupled with long pulse durations and high voltages result in lesser amounts of muscle fatigue and perceived soreness. The identification of optimal stimulation patterns to maximize muscle performance will reduce the effect of muscle fatigue and potentially improve clinical efficacy.",2012,49,2,,,#4163,Bickel 2012,

Before (PRE) and after (POS) training, quadriceps PCSAs were estimated from ultrasound measurements. Each individual followed a protocol of 10 s submaximal (20% and 60%MVC) knee extension isometric contractions. Knee torque and surface EMG from three superficial quadriceps components were synchronously collected. EMG signal from vastus intermedius was estimated from other muscles. After training, the subjects presented an increase of 14.3 ± 5.1% of the maximum isometric torque, while the gain of muscle volume was 6.0 ± 3.0%. RMS error between EMG-driven and dynamometer joint torques, for the best estimation condition, were: 20%MVC PRE= 10.8 ± 3.8%, POS = 11,0 ± 4.9%; 60%MVC PRE = 12.1 ± 3.2%, POS = 8.3 ± 2.5%.

Subjects included 19 healthy male and 20 healthy female volunteers. Following a dynamic warm-up period, subjects performed 30 reciprocal, concentric maximal knee extension and flexion contractions at a pre-set angular velocity of 3.14 rad x s(-1) on the Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer. Values for knee extensor peak torque, work, and power were calculated for each repetition over an angular displacement of 1.05 rad for each repetition. The single highest repetition value for knee extensor and flexor peak torque, work, and power was then calculated relative to body mass (N x m x kg(-1), J x kg(-1), W x kg(-1)) and allometric-scaled (N x m x kg(-) (n), J x kg(-) (n), W x kg(-) (n)) units. The allometric-scaled units were derived from a log-log transformation and linear regression analysis to calculate the exponent to which body mass is raised. The rate of quadriceps femoris muscle fatigue was calculated as the decline in each isokinetic variable by the linear slope from the single highest repetition value through the 30th repetition, and by two different fatigue indexes. The results demonstrate higher knee extension and flexion peak torque, work, and power in absolute, relative, and allometric-scaled units for males compared to females. Males exhibited higher fatigue rates for both muscle groups of each isokinetic variable than females, as described by the slope and the fatigue index, except when adjusted for peak values via analysis of covariance. The findings suggest that during maximal-effort muscle contractions, males exhibit a higher susceptibility to muscle fatigue than females, a phenomenon that may be related to an inherent ability to generate higher knee extensor and flexor torque.",2003,89,2,134-141,,#4167,Pincivero 2003, 
1416,33177655.0,Considerations on the human Achilles tendon moment arm for in vivo triceps surae muscle–tendon unit force estimates,Scientific Reports,"Moment arm-angle functions (MA-a-functions) are commonly used to estimate in vivo muscle forces in humans. However, different MA-a-functions might not only influence the magnitude of the estimated muscle forces but also change the shape of the muscle's estimated force-angle relationship (F-a-r). Therefore, we investigated the influence of different literature based Achilles tendon MA-a-functions on the triceps surae muscle-tendon unit F-a-r. The individual in vivo triceps torque-angle relationship was determined in 14 participants performing maximum voluntary fixed-end plantarflexion contractions from 18.3° ± 3.2° plantarflexion to 24.2° ± 5.1° dorsiflexion on a dynamometer. The resulting F-a-r were calculated using 15 literature-based in vivo Achilles tendon MA-a-functions. MA-a-functions affected the F-a-r shape and magnitude of estimated peak active triceps muscle-tendon unit force. Depending on the MA-a-function used, the triceps was solely operating on the ascending limb (n = 2), on the ascending limb and plateau region (n = 12), or on the ascending limb, plateau region and descending limb of the F-a-r (n = 1). According to our findings, the estimated triceps muscle-tendon unit forces and the shape of the F-a-r are highly dependent on the MA-a-function used. As these functions are affected by many variables, we recommend using individual Achilles tendon MA-a-functions, ideally accounting for contraction intensity-related changes in moment arm magnitude.",2020,10,1,11-Jan,,#4168,Holzer 2020, 
1417,31829806.0,"Skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity with lifelong aerobic exercise",Journal of Applied Physiology,"We examined the influence of lifelong aerobic exercise on skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity. Young exercisers [YE; n = 20, 10 women (W), 25 ± 1 yr], lifelong exercisers (LLE; n = 28, 7 W, 74 ± 2 yr), and old healthy nonexercisers (OH; n = 20, 10 W, 75 ± 1 yr) were studied. On average, LLE exercised 5 days/wk for 7 h/wk over the past 52 ± 1 yr. The LLE men were subdivided by exercise intensity [Performance (LLE-P), n = 14; Fitness (LLE-F), n = 7]. Upper and lower leg muscle size and adiposity [intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT)] were determined via MRI, and quadriceps isotonic and isometric function was assessed. For the quadriceps, aging decreased muscle size, isotonic and isometric strength, contraction velocity (men only), and power (P < 0.05). In women, LLE did not influence muscle size or function. In men, LLE attenuated the decline in muscle size and isometric strength by ~50% (P < 0.05). LLE did not influence other aspects of muscle function, nor did training intensity influence muscle size or function. For the triceps surae, aging decreased muscle size only in the women, whereas LLE (both sexes) and training intensity (LLE men) did not influence muscle size. In both sexes, aging increased thigh and calf IMAT by ~130% (P < 0.05), whereas LLE attenuated the thigh increase by ~50% (P < 0.05). In the LLE men, higher training intensity decreased thigh and calf IMAT by ~30% (P < 0.05). In summary, aging and lifelong aerobic exercise influenced muscle size, function, and adipose tissue infiltration in a sex- and muscle-specific fashion. Higher training intensity throughout the life span provided greater protection against adipose tissue infiltration into muscle.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first study to examine skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity in women and men in their eighth decade of life that have engaged in lifelong aerobic exercise. The findings reveal sex and upper and lower leg muscle group-specific benefits related to skeletal muscle size, function, and adiposity and that exercise intensity influences intermuscular adiposity.

1420,,A model of the upper extremity for simulating musculoskeletal surgery and analyzing neuromuscular control,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Biomechanical models of the musculoskeletal system are frequently used to study neuromuscular control and simulate surgical procedures. To be broadly applicable, a model must be accessible to users, provide accurate representations of muscles and joints, and capture important interactions between joints. We have developed a model of the upper extremity that includes 15 degrees of freedom representing the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, thumb, and index finger, and 50 muscle compartments crossing these joints. The kinematics of each joint and the force-generating parameters for each muscle were derived from experimental data. The model estimates the muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms for each of the muscles over a wide range of postures. Given a pattern of muscle activations, the model also estimates muscle forces and joint moments. The moment arms and maximum moment-generating capacity of each muscle group (e.g., elbow flexors) were compared to experimental data to assess the accuracy of the model. These comparisons showed that moment arms and joint moments estimated using the model captured important features of upper extremity geometry and mechanics. The model also revealed coupling between joints, such as increased passive finger flexion moment with wrist extension.

1421,,An extension of Hill's three‐component model to include different fibre types in finite element modelling of muscle,International journal for numerical methods in engineering,"Most of the proposed versions of the Hill's model use a sliding-element theory, considering a single sarcomere. However, a muscle represents a collection of different fibre types with a large range in contractile properties among them. An extension of Hill's three-component model is proposed here to take into account different fibre types. We present a model consisting of a number of sarcomeras of different types coupled in parallel with the connective tissue. Each sarcomere is modelled by one non-linear elastic element connected in series with one non-linear contractile element. Using the finite element method, in an incremental-iterative scheme of calculating equilibrium configurations of a muscle, the key step is the determination of stresses corresponding to strain increments. The stress calculation procedure for the extended Hill's model is reduced to the solution of a number of independent non-linear equations with respect to the stretch increments of the serial elastic elements in each sarcomere. Since the distribution of the specific fibre type is non-uniform over the muscle volume, we have material heterogeneity which we modelled by using the so-called 'Generalized Isoparametric Element Formulation' for functionally graded materials (FGMs). The proposed computational scheme is built in our FE package PAK, so that muscles of complex three-dimensional shapes can be modelled. In numerical examples, we illustrate the main characteristics of the developed numerical model and some possibilities of realistic modelling of muscle functioning.",2007,71,7,801-817,,#4175,Stojanovic 2007,
1422,33038068.0,"Comparison of the relative muscle volume of triceps surae among sprinters, runners, and untrained participants",Physiological Reports,"Muscle hypertrophy is considered more prominent in fast-twitch than in slow-twitch muscles. This leads to the hypothesis that the relative muscle volume of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) becomes larger than that of the soleus (SOL) in highly trained participants because MG and LG include more fast-twitch muscles than SOL. Thus, we compared relative muscle volume among highly trained sprinters, long-distance runners, and untrained participants to examine whether the above hypothesis is correct. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to calculate the muscle volume of MG, LG, and SOL from 126 participants. The total muscle volume of the three muscles and the relative muscle volume of each muscle with respect to the total muscle volume were calculated. The total muscle volume was significantly larger in the sprinters than in the long-distance runners and untrained participants. The relative muscle volume of MG was significantly larger in the sprinters than in the long-distance runners and untrained participants and that of SOL was significantly smaller in the sprinters than in the long-distance runners and untrained participants.

To investigate the effects of daily physical activity combined with Kaatsu, we examined the acute and chronic effects of walk training with and without Kaatsu on MRI-measured muscle size and maximum dynamic (one repetition maximum) and isometric strength, along with blood hormonal parameters. Nine men performed Kaatsu-walk training, and nine men performed walk training alone (control-walk). Training was conducted two times a day, 6 days/wk, for 3 wk using five sets of 2-min bouts (treadmill speed at 50 m/min), with a 1-min rest between bouts. Mean oxygen uptake during Kaatsu-walk and control-walk exercise was 19.5 (SD 3.6) and 17.2 % (SD 3.1) of treadmill-determined maximum oxygen uptake, respectively. Serum growth hormone was elevated (P < 0.01) after acute Kaatsu-walk exercise but not in control-walk exercise. MRI-measured thigh muscle cross-sectional area and muscle volume increased by 4-7%, and one repetition maximum and maximum isometric strength increased by 8-10% in the Kaatsu-walk group. There was no change in muscle size and dynamic and isometric strength in the control-walk group. Indicators of muscle damage (creatine kinase and myoglobin) and resting anabolic hormones did not change in both groups. The results suggest that the combination of leg muscle blood flow restriction with slow-walk training induces muscle hypertrophy and strength gain, despite the minimal level of exercise intensity. Kaatsu-walk training may be a potentially useful method for promoting muscle hypertrophy, covering a wide range of the population, including the frail and elderly.",2009,5,1,15-Sep,,#4178,Abe 2009,

The model is based on the assumption that, all other things being equal (ceteris paribus), the predicted changes in W depend on the measured changes of muscle force (F) or cross-sectional area (CSA) only. It follows that, if the measured changes in W are not equal to those predicted by the model, factors other than a change in F (or CSA) must be responsible for this difference. The model does not allow the determination of factors specifically involved in the adaptation process but it helps in discriminating whether an adaptation has taken place at a local level (when the observed changes in F would be attributed to factors other than the observed changes in CSA, e.g. co-contractions, fibre type modifications...), or at a central level (when the observed changes in W would be attributed to other factors than the observed changes in F, e.g. co-ordination of multiple joints and muscle groups...), or in both regions. In this paper the model has been applied to data reported in the literature on disuse (BR, bed rest), de-conditioning (SF, space flight), strength training (ST) and de-training (DT). The results of these calculations have confirmed previous observations on the determinants of the adaptation process and further suggest: (1) that training for one specific motor task (e.g. ST) could affect the performance of a second task (e.g. a maximal explosive jump) but that, as soon as the trained motor task is terminated (DT), this ability is re-gained; and (2) that neuromuscular impairment in disuse (BR) is closer to de-training than to the de-conditioning brought about by weightlessness (SF).",2002,88,3,193-202,,#4181,Zamparo 2002, 
1428,,Functional and structural moment arm validation for musculoskeletal models: a study of the human forearm and hand,bioRxiv,"The development of realistic musculoskeletal models is a fundamental goal for the theoretical progress in sensorimotor control and its engineering applications, e.g., in the biomimetic control of artificial limbs. Yet, accurate models require extensive experimental measures to validate structural and functional parameters describing muscle state over the full physiological range of motion. However, available experimental measurements of, for example, muscle moment arms are sparse and often disparate. Validation of these models is not trivial because of the highly complex anatomy and behavior of human limbs. In this study, we developed a method to validate and scale kinematic muscle parameters using posture-dependent moment arm profiles, isometric force measurements, and a computational detection of assembly errors. We used a previously published model with 18 degrees of freedom (DOFs) and 32 musculotendon actuators with force generated from a Hill-type muscle model. The muscle path from origin to insertion with wrapping geometry was used to model the muscle lengths and moment arms. We simulated moment arm profiles across the full physiological range of motion and compared them to an assembled dataset of published and merged experimental profiles. The muscle paths were adjusted using custom metrics based on root-mean-square and correlation coefficient of the difference between simulated and experimental values. Since the available measurements were sparse and the examination of high-dimensional muscles is challenging, we developed analyses to identify common failures, i.e., moment arm functional flipping due to the sign reversal in simulated moments and the imbalance of force generation between antagonistic groups in postural extremes. The validated model was used to evaluate the expected errors in torque generation with the assumption of constant instead of the posture-dependent moment arms at the wrist flexion-extension DOF, which is the critical joint in our model with the largest number of crossing muscles. We found that there was a reduction of joint torques by about 35% in the extreme quartiles of the wrist DOF. The use of realistic musculoskeletal models is essential for the reconstruction of hand dynamics. These models may improve the understanding of muscle actions and help in the design and control of artificial limbs in future applications.",2020,,,,,#4182,Boots 2020,

Recordings of MVC and 50 Hz torque were also done in 7 control subjects (24-69 y) without stroke. The MVC torque was smaller in the contralesional than ipsilesilesional limb (29.8 ± 21.3 Nm vs. 42.5 ± 12.0 Nm, p = .04), and was associated with deficits in activation (r2 = .77) and EMG amplitude (r2 = .71). Antagonist coactivation percentage was not significantly different between limbs. Muscle volume, 50 Hz torque, and specific torque (50Hz torque/muscle volume) were also not different between sides.

Torque and power were normalized to muscle volume. The interpolated twitch technique was used to measure voluntary activation (VA) and evoked twitch and torque-frequency characteristics were measured to obtain information about muscle fibre distribution. Torque and power at all loads were significantly lower in women (p<0.05). Sex differences in power were reduced by 50% when controlling for muscle volume but were still significant at 10-40% MVC (p<0.05). No differences in VA, torque-frequency properties or time-to-peak tension of the evoked twitch were observed (p>0.05).

We investigated biceps femoris long head (BFlh) myosin heavy chain (MHC) composition from biopsy samples, and the association of hamstrings composition and hamstrings muscle volume (using MRI) with knee flexor maximal and explosive strength. Thirty-one young men performed maximal (concentric, eccentric, isometric) and explosive (isometric) contractions.

In contrast, BFlh muscle composition was not related to any maximal or explosive strength measure. BFlh MHC composition was not found to be ""fast"", and therefore composition does not appear to explain the high incidence of hamstrings strain injury.

1432,35388613.0,Muscle architecture and performance,Muscular Function in Exercise and Training,"The size and arrangement of fibres play a determinate role in the kinetic and energetic performance of muscles. Extrapolations between fibre architecture and performance underpin our understanding of how muscles function and how they are adapted to power specific motions within and across species. Here we provide a synopsis of how this 'fibre to function' paradigm has been applied to understand muscle design, performance and adaptation in animals. Our review highlights the widespread application of the fibre to function paradigm across a diverse breadth of biological disciplines but also reveals a potential and highly prevalent limitation running through past studies. Specifically, we find that quantification of muscle architectural properties is almost universally based on an extremely small number of fibre measurements. Despite the volume of research into muscle properties, across a diverse breadth of research disciplines, the fundamental assumption that a small proportion of fibre measurements can accurately represent the architectural properties of a muscle has never been quantitatively tested. Subsequently, we use a combination of medical imaging, statistical analysis, and physics-based computer simulation to address this issue for the first time. By combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and deterministic fibre tractography we generated a large number of fibre measurements (>3000) rapidly for individual human lower limb muscles. Through statistical subsampling simulations of these measurements, we demonstrate that analysing a small number of fibres (n < 25) typically used in previous studies may lead to extremely large errors in the characterisation of overall muscle architectural properties such as mean fibre length and physiological cross-sectional area. Through dynamic musculoskeletal simulations of human walking and jumping, we demonstrate that recovered errors in fibre architecture characterisation have significant implications for quantitative predictions of in-vivo dynamics and muscle fibre function within a species. Furthermore, by applying data-subsampling simulations to comparisons of muscle function in humans and chimpanzees, we demonstrate that error magnitudes significantly impact both qualitative and quantitative assessment of muscle specialisation, potentially generating highly erroneous conclusions about the absolute and relative adaption of muscles across species and evolutionary transitions. Our findings have profound implications for how a broad diversity of research fields quantify muscle architecture and interpret muscle function.",1987,26,,23-Dec,,#4189,Edgerton 1987,biomechanics

1434,20158505.0,Differential age‐related changes in motor unit properties between elbow flexors and extensors,Acta physiologica,"Healthy adult ageing of the human neuromuscular system is comprised of changes that include atrophy, weakness and slowed movements with reduced spinal motor neurone output expressed by lower motor unit discharge rates (MUDRs). The latter observation has been obtained mostly from hand and lower limb muscles. The purpose was to determine the extent to which elbow flexor and extensor contractile properties, and MUDRs in six old (83 +/- 4 years) and six young (24 +/- 1 years) men were affected by age, and whether any adaptations were similar for both muscle groups.",2010,200,1,45-55,,#4191,Dalton 2010, 
1435,24368144.0,Relationships of 35 lower limb muscles to height and body mass quantified using MRI,Journal of biomechanics,"Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the body and serves various physiological functions including the generation of movement and support. Whole body motor function requires adequate quantity, geometry, and distribution of muscle. This raises the question: how do muscles scale with subject size in order to achieve similar function across humans? While much of the current knowledge of human muscle architecture is based on cadaver dissection, modern medical imaging avoids limitations of old age, poor health, and limited subject pool, allowing for muscle architecture data to be obtained in vivo from healthy subjects ranging in size. The purpose of this study was to use novel fast-acquisition MRI to quantify volumes and lengths of 35 major lower limb muscles in 24 young, healthy subjects and to determine if muscle size correlates with bone geometry and subject parameters of mass and height. It was found that total lower limb muscle volume scales with mass (R(2)=0.85) and with the height-mass product (R(2)=0.92). Furthermore, individual muscle volumes scale with total muscle volume (median R(2)=0.66), with the height-mass product (median R(2)=0.61), and with mass (median R(2)=0.52). Muscle volume scales with bone volume (R(2)=0.75), and muscle length relative to bone length is conserved (median s.d.=2.1% of limb length). These relationships allow for an arbitrary subject's individual muscle volumes to be estimated from mass or mass and height while muscle lengths may be estimated from limb length. The dataset presented here can further be used as a normative standard to compare populations with musculoskeletal pathologies.",2014,47,3,631-638,,#4192,Handsfield 2014,Allometry
1436,,CT-Based Muscle Attenuation May be Able to Account for Age-and Muscle-Specific Differences in Maximum Muscle Stress,Summer Bioengineering Conference,"In musculoskeletal modeling, isometric muscle strength has been primarily determined based on muscle size. Specifically, the maximum force a muscle can produce may be calculated as:FMAX=MMS×PCSA, where FMAX is maximum isometric muscle force, MMS is maximum muscle stress, and PCSA is muscle physiological cross-sectional area. In general, modeling studies have selected a constant value of MMS, and applied it to all muscles in the model. However, the values reported in the literature for MMS vary widely [1, 2], from as little as 23 N/cm2 up to 137 N/cm2. Furthermore, MMS is likely lower in older adults than young adults, as age-related declines in muscle strength are significantly greater than declines in muscle mass [3], and the specific tension of gastrocnemius fascicles is 30% lower in elderly men than young men [4]. In addition, MMS is not constant between muscle groups. For example, the MMS of the elbow flexors is much greater than that of the elbow extensors [1], while the MMS of the ankle dorsiflexors is more than twice that of the ankle plantar flexors [5]. Thus, the use of a single constant for MMS in musculoskeletal models does not account for differences between individuals or muscle groups, and there is a need for a quantitative approach to assign different values of MMS to muscles in musculoskeletal models.",2012,44809,,233-234,,#4193,Anderson 2012,
1437,11394241.0,Changes in power with resistance training in older and younger men and women,Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biomedical Sciences and Medical Sciences,"The purpose of this investigation was to assess the myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression in the vastus lateralis muscle from elderly men and women, and to determine whether heavy resistance training influences its expression. Twenty healthy, mildly physically active subjects gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The experimental group consisted of seven men and seven women [mean (SD) age 65.5 (4.1) years] and the control group consisted of three men and three women [mean (SD) age 62.3 (3.6) years]. The 6-month resistance training program was divided into two phases with weeks 1-12 consisting of high-intensity resistance training, and weeks 13-24 involving power training. Muscle biopsy samples were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle at week 0 and week 24 using the needle biopsy technique. The male and female experimental groups both exhibited a significant decrease (P < or = 0.05) in the percentage of MHC IIb, while the experimental female group also demonstrated a significant increase (P < or = 0.05) in the expression of MHC IIa, after 24 weeks of heavy resistance training. There was no change in MHC expression within the control group. The male [130.4 (25.3) kg vs 171.1 (30.5) kg] and female [58.2 (8.3) kg vs 77.9 (11.1) kg] experimental groups exhibited a significant increase (P < or = 0.05) in the maximal strength values for the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) squat exercise. The control group showed no change in strength for the 1RM squat exercise for either the male [115.8 (35.10 kg vs 123.8 (47.2) kg] or female [57.5 (99.0) kg vs 58.3 (2.9) kg] groups. The results clearly show that elderly subjects undergoing heavy resistance training have the ability to produce a similar shift in the expression of MHC isoforms from MHC IIb to MHC IIa, as has been shown to occur in younger subjects. This highlights the plasticity of human skeletal muscle in response to heavy resistance training, even at older ages.",1999,54,11,M591-M596,,#4194,Jozsi 1999, 
1438,,Acute effects of passive static stretching on the vastus lateralis muscle architecture of healthy young men,Revista Brasileira de Cineantropometria & Desempenho Humano,"The aim of the study was to investigate the acute effects of passive static stretching (PSS) on the fascicle length (FL) and fascicle angle (FA) of the vastus lateralis muscle (VL) in two different joint positions. Twelve physically active men (26.9 ± 7.5 years, 178.6 ± 7.0 cm, and 82.5 ± 16.8 kg) were placed in the prone position for the acquisition of ultrasound images (US) of VL, registered with extended and totally flexed knee up to the heel contact with the gluteus, before and after a PSS routine comprised of three 30-s repetitions maintained in the maximal discomfort position as reported by the participant. Results of the paired t-test indicated an increase in FL (16.2%; p = 0.012) and reduction in FA (15.5%; p = 0.003) in pre vs. post stretching comparisons for the extended knee position. There was also a significant increase in FL (34%; p = 0.0001) and reduction in FA (25%; p = 0.0007) when compared the extended knee vs. flexed knee positions. There were no significant differences in muscle architecture variables for the flexed knee position. The results showed high and moderate correlation of FL and FA for the extended (r = -0.89 and r = -0.74) and flexed knee (r = -0.76 and r = -0.78) position, pre and post stretching, respectively. It was concluded that the static stretching acutely affects the vastus lateralis muscle architecture only in the extended knee position, but not in the flexed knee position.",2017,19,,585-595,,#4195,CÃ©sar 2017,
