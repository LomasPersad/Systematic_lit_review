however, it is detrimental in terms of cardiac output and leads finally to failure. this adaptational process is partly explained by quantitative and qualitative changes in contractile proteins. protein synthesis is rapidly enhanced and muscles hypertrophy, which in turn multiplies the contractile units and for the cardiac cylinder normalizes the wall stress. in the meantime the structure and, for myosin, the biological activity of several contractile proteins are modified. these modifications are very unlikely to be posttranscriptional and are in fact explained by several isoform shifts. in both tissues, for example, the expression of the gene coding for a fast myosin (mhcf in skeletal muscle, alpha-mhc in ventricles) is repressed and that of the gene coding for a slow myosin (beta-mhc in both tissues) is stimulated. this is accompanied by a coordinated increase in synthesis of other contractile proteins and, in skeletal muscle only, by isoform shifts of myosin light chains and of the tm-tn regulatory system. other changes are less well understood. during development it has recently been discovered that three different mhcs (mhcemb, mhcneo, and mhcf) appear sequentially in fast skeletal muscle, which explains, for example, several contradictions of immunological cross-reactions. currently, however, the functional significance of this finding is unknown, and the well-known decrease of shortening velocity observed in cardiac and skeletal muscles during fetal life is unexplained in terms of contractile proteins.(abstract truncated at 400 words)', 'the age-related loss of muscle mass known as senile sarcopenia is one of the main determinants of frailty in old age. molecular, cellular, nutritional and hormonal mechanisms are at the basis of sarcopenia and are responsible for a progressive deterioration in skeletal muscle size and function. both at single-fibre and at whole-muscle level, the loss of force exceeds that predicted by the decrease in muscle size. for single fibres, the loss of intrinsic force is mostly due to a loss in myofibrillar protein content. for whole muscle, in addition to changes in neural drive, alterations in muscle architecture and in tendon mechanical properties, exemplified by a reduction in tendon stiffness, have recently been shown to contribute to this phenomenon. resistance training can, however, cause substantial gains in muscle mass and strength and provides a protective effect against several of the cellular and molecular changes associated with muscle wasting and weakness. in old age, not only muscles but also tendons are highly responsive to training, since an increase in tendon stiffness has been observed after a period of increased loading. many of the myotendinous factors characterizing ageing can be at least partly reversed by resistance training.', ""senile sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass associated with aging, is one of the main causes of muscle weakness and reduced locomotor ability in old age. although this condition is mainly driven by neuropathic processes, nutritional, hormonal and immunological factors, as well as a reduction in physical activity, contribute to this phenomenon. sarcopenia alone, however, does not fully account for the observed muscle weakness, as the loss of force is greater than that accounted for by the decrease in muscle size. as a consequence, a reduction in the force per unit area, both at single fibre and at whole muscle level, is observed. we recently suggested that at whole muscle level, this reduction in intrinsic force is the result of the combined effect of changes in (1) muscle architecture, (2) tendon mechanical properties, (3) neural drive (reduced agonist and increased antagonist muscle activity) and (4) single fibre-specific tension. whereas several studies support the role of the last two factors in the loss of intrinsic muscle force with aging, alterations in muscle architecture and in tendon mechanical properties have also been shown to contribute to the above phenomenon. indeed, sarcopenia of the human plantarflexors, represented by a 25% reduction in muscle volume, was found to be associated with a 10% reduction in fibre fascicle length and 13% reduction in pennation angle. these architectural alterations were accompanied by a 10% decrease in tendon stiffness, attributable to alterations in tendon material properties, as suggested by a 14% decrease in young's modulus. most of these changes may be reversed by 14 weeks of resistive training; both fibre fascicle length and tendon stiffness were found to be increased by 10 and 64%, respectively. surprisingly, however, training had no effect on the estimated relative length-tension properties of the muscle, indicating that the effects of greater tendon stiffness and increased fascicle length cancelled out each other. it seems that natural strategies may be in place to ensure that the relative operating range of muscle remains unaltered by changes in physical activity, in old age.""]"

males n = 2; average age 35.3 years) and 14 tth sufferers (females n = 11; males n = 3; average age 30.7 years). two techniques were used specifically to stress the atlantooccipital segments (technique 1 - c1) and c2-3 zygapophysial joints (technique 2 - c2). two techniques were also applied to the arm--the common extensor origin and the mid belly of the biceps brachii. participants reported reproduction of head pain with ""yes"" or ""no"" and rated the intensity of head pain and local pressure of application on a scale of 0 -10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = intolerable pain. results: none of the subjects reported head pain during application of techniques on the arm. head pain referral during the cervical examination was reported by 8 of 14 (57%) control participants, all tth patients and all but 1 migraineur (p < .002). in each case, participants reported that the referred head pain was similar to the pain they usually experienced during tth or migraine. the frequency of head pain referral was identical for techniques 1 and 2. the intensity of referral did not differ between technique 1 and technique 2 or between groups. tenderness ratings to thumb pressure were comparable between the techniques 1 and 2 when pressure was applied to c1 and c2 respectively and across groups. similarly, there were no significant differences for tenderness ratings to thumb pressure between technique 1 and technique 2 on the arm or between groups. while tenderness ratings to thumb pressure for technique 2 were similar for both referral (n = 41) and non-referral (n = 7) groups, tenderness ratings for technique 1 in the referral group were significantly greater when compared with the non-referral group (p = .01). conclusions: our data support the continuum concept of headache, one in which noxious cervical afferent information may well be significantly underestimated. the high incidence of reproduction of headache supports the evaluation of musculoskeletal features in patients presenting with migrainous and tth symptoms. this, in turn, may have important implications for understanding the pathophysiology of headache and developing alternative treatment options.', 'identification of subgroups of patients with different levels of sensitization and clinical features can help to identify groups at risk and the development of better therapeutic strategies. the aim of this study was to identify subgroups of patients with tension type headache (tth) with different levels of sensitization, clinical pain features, and psychological outcomes. methods: a total of 197 individuals with tth participated. headache intensity, frequency, and duration and medication intake were collected with a 4-weeks diary. pressure pain thresholds were assessed bilaterally over the temporalis muscle, c5-c6 joint, second metacarpal and tibialis anterior muscle to determine widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia. the hospital anxiety and depression scale assessed anxiety and depression. the state-trait anxiety inventory evaluated the state and trait levels of anxiety. the headache disability inventory evaluated the burden of headache. health-related quality of life was determined with the sf-36 questionnaire. groups were considered as positive (three or more criteria) or negative (less than three criteria) on a clinical prediction rule: headache duration <8.5 h/day; headache frequency <5.5 days/week; bodily pain <47 and vitality <47.5. results: the ancova revealed that subjects in group 1 (positive rule, n = 89) exhibited longer headache history, shorter headache duration, lower headache frequency, higher widespread pressure hyperalgesia, higher anxiety trait levels, and lower quality of life (all, p < 0.01) than those subjects within group 2 (negative rule, n = 108). differences were similar between men and women. conclusions: this study identified a subgroup of patients with tth with higher sensitization, higher chronicity of headaches and worse quality of life but lower frequency and duration of headache episodes. this subgroup of individuals with tth may need particular attention and specific therapeutic programs for avoiding potential chronification.', 'nociceptive mechanisms in tension-type headache are poorly understood. the aim was to investigate the pain sensitivity of pericranial muscles and a limb muscle in patients with tension-type headache. experimental muscle pain was induced by standardized infusions of 0.5 ml of 1 m hypertonic saline into two craniofacial muscles (anterior temporalis (tpa) and masseter (mas)) and a limb muscle (anterior tibial (ta)) in 24 frequent episodic tension-type headache patients (fetth), 22 chronic tension-type headache patients (ctth) and 26 age and gender matched healthy subjects. headache patients were examined twice, both on days with and on days without headache. the pressure pain thresholds (ppts) were determined before and after infusions. the subjects continuously reported intensity of saline-induced pain on an electronic visual analogue scale (vas) and the perceived area of pain was drawn on anatomical maps. headache patients demonstrated significantly lower ppts, higher saline-evoked vas pain scores and greater pain areas than healthy subjects at all the tested muscle sites (p<0.05). there was a significant gender difference for the ppts in all three groups of participants (p<0.05) and for vas pain scores in the ctth patients (p<0.05). there was no difference in pain sensitivity between fetth and ctth or between patients with or without headache. in conclusion, the present study demonstrates the presence of generalized pain hypersensitivity both in fetth and ctth compared to controls which is unrelated to actual headache status and extends to include responses to longer-lasting stimuli which are clinically highly relevant. gender differences in deep pain sensitivity seem to be a consistent finding both in healthy controls and patients with tension-type headache.']"

164 patients were smokers. professional voice users composed the large majority of the working population and were more frequently affected by organic dysphonia. patients with dysphonia due to movement disorders presented a worse voice quality and voice-related quality of life. conclusions: in patients seeking voice therapy, there are more females than males, children and adolescents represent a minority of the sample, professional voice users more commonly present organic dysphonia, and patients with dysphonia due to movement disorders show significantly worse voice quality.', 'studies have established the role of behavioral therapy in treating voice problems. however, studies have also identified patient adherence as a limitation in voice therapy effectiveness. accordingly, an understanding of patient preferences may help to improve adherence and increase voice therapy success. the primary aim of this study was to understand patient-perceived facilitators and barriers influencing voice therapy effectiveness in a group of treatment-seeking individuals with voice disorders. a secondary aim was to examine the relationship between self-reported improvement from voice therapy and the voice handicap index-10 (vhi-10). study design: retrospective, observational study design. methods: one hundred ten patients enrolled in voice therapy at the university of pittsburgh voice center completed a self-administered patient perception of voice therapy questionnaire on discharge. data from 45 individuals who met study criteria were analyzed. results: patient-reported improvement from voice therapy was correlated with changes in vhi-10 scores. a majority of patients identified specific voice therapy exercises and transfer of techniques to conversation as the most useful aspects of treatment. few patients rated vocal hygiene education as most useful. generalizing new vocal behaviors was also identified as a barrier to voice therapy success for many patients. conclusions: in this study, patients valued direct voice therapy in which they worked on altering vocal behaviors more than indirect voice therapy that aimed to educate patients about their voice. study findings suggest the importance of direct voice therapy and the need to incorporate carryover activities early on in the therapy process for greater treatment satisfaction and success.', 'to assess treatment outcomes via acoustic voice laboratory measurements before and after intervention in patients with common voice problems and determine if outcome sensitivity of certain voice laboratory measures varies with disorder type. study design: retrospective and single-blinded. methods: in this study, 40 patients with a single voice disorder diagnosis of either benign vocal fold lesions (lesions), primary muscle tension dysphonia (mtd-1), vocal fold atrophy (atrophy) or unilateral vocal fold paralysis (uvfp) underwent baseline testing, a single intervention-type (phonosurgery/voice therapy), and follow-up testing at uniform time points. ten patients per diagnosis group were analyzed before and after treatment. time- and frequency-based acoustic measures taken from vowels and sentences as well as patient-perceptual analysis (voice handicap index-10) were reviewed. results: statistically significant improvements were observed for three of four groups. patients with muscle tension dysphonia displayed an improvement in cepstral spectral index of dysphonia speech (csid) (p < 0.05). patients with lesions had improved voice handicap index-10 (p < 0.05), cepstral peak prominence (cpp) vowel standard deviation (p < 0.05), and cpp speech (p < 0.05). patients with atrophy did not demonstrate significant improvement in any measure. patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis showed an improvement in csid speech (p < 0.05) and cpp speech (p < 0.05). in addition, strong effect sizes were observed for many of the acoustic parameters studied. conclusions: for all groups except atrophy, treatment was successful in improving patient perception of voice handicap and/or some acoustic voice parameters. a disorder-specific response to frequency-based acoustic measures was found.']"

Troponin I', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['experimental data from human cardiac myocytes at body temperature is crucial for a quantitative understanding of clinically relevant cardiac function and development of whole-organ computational models. however, such experimental data is currently very limited. specifically, important measurements to characterize changes in tension development in human cardiomyocytes that occur with perturbations in cell length are not available. to address this deficiency, in this study we present an experimental data set collected from skinned human cardiac myocytes, including the passive and viscoelastic properties of isolated myocytes, the steady-state force calcium relationship at different sarcomere lengths, and changes in tension following a rapid increase or decrease in length, and after constant velocity shortening. this data set is, to our knowledge, the first characterization of length and velocity-dependence of tension generation in human skinned cardiac myocytes at body temperature. we use this data to develop a computational model of contraction and passive viscoelasticity in human myocytes. our model includes troponin c kinetics, tropomyosin kinetics, a three-state crossbridge model that accounts for the distortion of crossbridges, and the cellular viscoelastic response. each component is parametrized using our experimental data collected in human cardiomyocytes at body temperature. furthermore we are able to confirm that properties of length-dependent activation at 37°c are similar to other species, with a shift in calcium sensitivity and increase in maximum tension. we revise our model of tension generation in the skinned isolated myocyte to replicate reported tension traces generated in intact muscle during isometric tension, to provide a model of human tension generation for multi-scale simulations. this process requires changes to calcium sensitivity, cooperativity, and crossbridge transition rates. we apply this model within multi-scale simulations of biventricular cardiac function and further refine the parametrization within the whole organ context, based on obtaining a healthy ejection fraction. this process reveals that crossbridge cycling rates differ between skinned myocytes and intact myocytes.', 'the specific and selective proteolysis of cardiac troponin i (ctni) has been proposed to play a key role in human ischemic myocardial disease, including stunning and acute pressure overload. in this study, the functional implications of ctni proteolysis were investigated in human cardiac tissue for the first time. the predominant human ctni degradation product (ctni(1-192)) and full-length ctni were expressed in escherichia coli, purified, reconstituted with the other cardiac troponin subunits, troponin t and c, and subsequently exchanged into human cardiac myofibrils and permeabilized cardiomyocytes isolated from healthy donor hearts. maximal isometric force and kinetic parameters were measured in myofibrils, using rapid solution switching, whereas force development was measured in single cardiomyocytes at various calcium concentrations, at sarcomere lengths of 1.9 and 2.2 mum, and after treatment with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase a (pka) to mimic beta-adrenergic stimulation. one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, western immunoblotting, and 3d imaging revealed that approximately 50% of endogenous ctni had been homogeneously replaced by ctni(1-192) in both myofibrils and cardiomyocytes. maximal tension was not affected, whereas the rates of force activation and redevelopment as well as relaxation kinetics were slowed down. ca(2+) sensitivity of the contractile apparatus was increased in preparations containing ctni(1-192) (pca(50): 5.73+/-0.03 versus 5.52+/-0.03 for ctni(1-192) and full-length ctni, respectively). the sarcomere length dependency of force development and the desensitizing effect of pka were preserved in ctni(1-192)-exchanged cardiomyocytes. these results indicate that degradation of ctni in human myocardium may impair diastolic function, whereas systolic function is largely preserved.', 'striated muscle contraction is regulated by the binding of ca(2+) to the n-terminal regulatory lobe of the cardiac troponin c (ctnc) subunit in the troponin complex. in the heart, beta-adrenergic stimulation induces protein kinase a phosphorylation of cardiac troponin i (ctni) at ser23/24 to alter the interaction of ctni with ctnc in the troponin complex and is critical to the regulation of cardiac contractility. we investigated the effect of the dilated cardiomyopathy linked ctnc gly159 to asp (ctnc-g159d) mutation on the development of ca(2+)-dependent tension and atpase rate in whole troponin-exchanged skinned rat trabeculae. even though this mutation is located in the c-terminal lobe of ctnc, the g159d mutation was demonstrated to depress atpase activation and filament sliding in vitro. the effects of this mutation within the cardiac myofilament are unknown. our results demonstrate that the ctnc-g159d mutation by itself does not alter the myofilament response to ca(2+) in the cardiac muscle lattice. however, in the presence of ctni phosphorylated at ser23/24, which reduced ca(2+) sensitivity and enhanced cross-bridge cycling in controls, ctnc-g159d specifically blunted the phosphorylation induced decrease in ca(2+)-sensitive tension development without altering cross-bridge cycling. measurements in purified troponin confirmed that this ctnc-g159d blunting of myofilament desensitization results from altered ca(2+)-binding to ctnc. our results provide novel evidence that modification of the ctnc-ctni interaction has distinct effects on troponin ca(2+)-binding and cross-bridge kinetics to suggest a novel role for thin filament mutations in the modulation of myofilament function through beta-adrenergic signaling as well as the development of cardiomyopathy.']"

'', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['study design: the superficial and deep lamina of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia have been studied anatomically and biomechanically. in embalmed human specimens, the posterior layer has been loaded by simulating the action of various muscles. the effect has been studied using raster photography. to study the role of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia in load transfer between spine, pelvis, legs, and arms. summary of background data: it has been determined whether muscles such as the gluteus maximus, latissimus dorsi, erector muscle, and biceps femoris are functionally coupled via the thoracolumbar fascia. the caudal relations of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia have not been previously studied. methods: dissection was directed to the bilaminar posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia of 10 human specimens. the superficial and deep lamina were studied using visual inspection and raster photography. tension to the posterior layer of the fascia was simulated by traction to various muscles and measured by studying the displacement in the posterior layer. results: traction to a variety of muscles caused displacement of the posterior layer. this implies that in vivo, the superficial lamina will be tensed by contraction of various muscles, such as the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus and erector muscle, and the deep lamina by contraction of the biceps femoris. caudal to the level of l4 (in some specimens, l2-l3), tension in the posterior layer was transmitted to the contralateral side. conclusions: anatomic structures normally described as hip, pelvic, and leg muscles interact with so-called arm and spinal muscles via the thoracolumbar fascia. this allows for effective load transfer between spine, pelvis, legs, and arms--an integrated system. specific electromyographic studies should reveal whether the gluteus maximus muscle and contralateral latissimus dorsi muscle are functionally coupled, especially during rotation of the trunk. in that case, the combined action of these muscles assists in rotating the trunk, while simultaneously stabilizing the lower lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints.', 'the residual limb of transtibial amputation (tta) prosthetic users is threatened daily by pressure ulcers (pu) and deep tissue injury (dti) caused mainly by sustained mechanical strains and stresses. several risk factors dominate the extent of internal tissue loads in the residuum. in this study, we developed a set of three-dimensional finite element (fe) models that were variants of a patient-specific fe model, built from magnetic resonance imaging scans. the set of fe modes was utilized to assess the impact of the following risk factors on the strain/stress distribution in the muscle flap: (i) the tibial length, (ii) the tibial bevelment, (iii) a fibular osteophyte, (iv) the mechanical properties of the muscle, and (v) scarring in different locations and depths. a total of 12 nonlinear fe model configurations, representing variations in these factors, were built and solved. we present herein calculations of compression, tension and shear strains and stresses, von mises stresses, and strain energy density averaged in critical locations in the muscle flap as well as volumes of concentration of elevated stresses in these areas. our results overall show higher stresses accumulating in the bone proximity rather than in outlying soft tissues. the longer bone configurations spread the loads toward the external surfaces of the muscle flap. when shortening the truncated bones from 11.2 to 9.2 cm, the von mises stresses at the distal edges of the bones were relieved considerably (by up to 80%), which indicates a predicted decreased risk for dti. decreasing the tibial bevelment mildly, from 52.3 degrees to 37.7 degrees caused propagation of internal stresses from the bone proximity toward the more superficial soft tissues of the residuum, thereby also theoretically reducing the risk for dti. an osteophyte at the distal fibular end increased the strain and stress distributions directly under the fibula but had little effect (<1%) on stresses at other sites, e.g., under the tibia. elevation of muscle stiffness (instantaneous shear modulus increase from 8.5 to 16.2 kpa), simulating variation between patients, and muscle flap contraction or spasm, showed the most substantial effect by an acute rise of the von mises stresses at the bone proximity. the mean von mises stresses at the bone proximity were approximately twofold higher in the contracted/spastic muscle when compared to the flaccid muscle. locating a surgical scar in different sites and depths of the residuum had the least influence on the overall loading of the muscle flap (where stresses changed by <7%). pending further validation by epidemiological pu and dti risk factor studies, the conclusions of this study can be incorporated as guidelines for tta surgeons, physical therapists, prosthetists, and the tta patients themselves to minimize the onset of pu and dti in this population. additionally, the present analyses can be used to guide or focus epidemiological research of pu and dti risk factors in the tta population.', ""divergent descriptions of the anatomic location and biomechanical function of the iliotibial tract (it) can be found in the literature. this study attempted to obtain exact data regarding the anatomic course and material characteristics including the biomechanical properties of this structure. the following were its aims: (1) anatomical investigations of the it; (2) mechanical properties of the it; (3) femoral head centralizing force of the it and subligamentous forces in the height of the greater trochanter in different joint positions by using a custom-made measuring prosthesis and a subligamentous positioned sensor; (4) construction of a finite element model of the proximal femur including the it and measuring the femoral neck angle under variation. the hip joints and it in a total of 18 unfixed corpses were evaluated. we studied the anatomic relationship to surrounding structures, as well as the material properties with the help of tensile strength testing utilizing an uniaxial apparatus. during the test, a load-displacement curve was registered, documenting the maximum load and deformation of the it. to measure the subligamentous pressure at the height of the greater trochanter, a custom-made sensor with a power-recording instrument was constructed. furthermore, an altered hip prosthesis with a pressure gauge at the height of the femoral neck was used to measure the forces which are directed at the acetabulum. the investigations were done in neutral-0 position and ab/adduction of the hip joint of the unfixed corpse. in addition, we varied the femoral neck angle between 115 degrees and 155 degrees in 5 degrees steps. to confirm the subligamentous forces, we did the same measurements intraoperatively at the height of the greater trochanter before and after hip joint replacement in 12 patients. we constructed a finite element model of the proximal femur and considering the it. the acquisition of the data was done at physiological (128 degrees), varus (115 degrees), and valgus (155 degrees) femoral neck angles. the influencing forces of the it at the height of the greater trochanter and the forces at the femoral head or the acetabulum could be measured. our anatomical investigations revealed a splitting of the it into a superficial and a deep portion, which covers the tensor fasciae latae. the tensor fasciae latae has an insertion on the it. the it continues down the femur, passing over the greater trochanter without developing an actual fixation to the bone. part of the insertion of the gluteus maximus radiates into the it. the it passes over the vastus lateralis and inserts at the infracondylar tubercle of the tibia or gerdy's tubercle, at the head of the fibula, as well as at the lateral intermuscular septum. portions also insert on the transverse and longitudinal retinaculum of the patella. concerning the material properties of the it, we found a structural stiffness of 17 n/mm extension on average (d = 17 n/mm). the subligamentous measurements at the height of the greater trochanter in the unfixed corpse and intraoperatively during hip joint replacement showed an increase of the forces during adduction and a decrease during abduction of the hip joint. we found thereby a maximum increase up to 106 n with 40 degrees adduction. concerning the femoral neck angle, we can state that valgus leads to lower subligamentous forces and varus to higher subligamentous forces. the forces directed at the acetabulum, which were measured by the prosthesis with a sensor along the femoral neck, showed a decrease with varus angles and an increase with valgus angles. the highest force of 624 n was measured with 40 degrees adduction and an angle of 155 degrees. the finite element model of the proximal femur showed a sole hip joint-centralizing force of the it of 655 n with a femoral neck angle of 128 degrees after subtraction of the gluteal muscle force and the body weight. at 115 degrees, we found an increase up to 997 n and a decrease to 438 n at 155 degrees. concerning the resulting forces in the acetabulum, we found opposite forces in comparison with the force of the it at the height of the greater trochanter: at 115 degrees, a femoral head-centralizing force of 1601 n; at 128 degrees, 2360 n; and at 155 degrees, 2422 n. by our investigations, we can approximately prove the hip joint-centralizing force of the it. by variation of the femoral neck angle and the position of the hip joint, we can predict the subligamentous force of the it and the resulting force at the femoral head or at the acetabulum. the intraoperative measurement of the subligamentous forces of the it is a good monitoring mechanism for the persistent hip-centralizing function of the it in the course of hip joint replacement. the surgeon has the opportunity to check the stability of the hip joint after

p < 0.05) and improved subjective daytime alertness. excessive sleepiness was reported to be altered in four studies, however the only clinically and statistically significant change in ess of -2.9 (sd 2.9;

p = 0.035) after three months of treatment but no reduction in sleepiness was reported. high dose combined treatment with ondansetron 24 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg showed a 40.5% decrease in ahi from the baseline at treatment day 28. paroxetine was shown to reduce ahi compared to placebo (-6.10 events/hour; 95% ci -11.00 to -1.20) but failed to improve daytime symptoms.promising results from the preliminary mirtazapine study failed to be reproduced in the two more recent multicentre trials and, moreover, the use of mirtazapine was associated with significant weight gain and sleepiness. few data were presented on the long-term tolerability of any of the compounds used. authors' conclusions: there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of drug therapy in the treatment of osa. small studies have reported positive effects of certain agents on short-term outcomes. certain agents have been shown to reduce the ahi in largely unselected populations with osa by between 24% and 45%. for donepezil and fluticasone, studies of longer duration with a larger population and better matching of groups are required to establish whether the change in ahi and impact on daytime symptoms are reproducible. individual patients had more complete responses to particular drugs. it is possible that better matching of drugs to patients according to the dominant mechanism of their osa will lead to better results and this also needs further study.""]"

25 studies), but had small effects on measures of muscle morphology (mean smdbs = 0.42; nine studies). specifically, rt produced large effects in both 1rm of upper (mean smdbs = 1.61; 11 studies) and lower (mean smdbs = 1.76; 19 studies) extremities and a medium effect in mvc of lower (mean smdbs = 0.76; four studies) extremities. results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables ""training period"" (p = 0.04) and ""intensity"" (p < 0.01) as well as ""total time under tension"" (p < 0.01) had significant effects on muscle strength, with the largest effect sizes for the longest training periods (mean smdbs = 2.34; 50-53 weeks), intensities of 70-79% of the 1rm (mean smdbs = 1.89), and total time under tension of 6.0 s (mean smdbs = 3.61). a tendency towards significance was found for rest in between sets (p = 0.06), with 60 s showing the largest effect on muscle strength (mean smdbs = 4.68; two studies). we also determined the independent effects of the remaining training variables on muscle strength. the following independently computed training variables are most effective in improving measures of muscle strength: a training frequency of two sessions per week (mean smdbs = 2.13), a training volume of two to three sets per exercise (mean smdbs = 2.99), seven to nine repetitions per set (mean smdbs = 1.98), and a rest of 4.0 s between repetitions (smdbs = 3.72). with regard to measures of muscle morphology, the small number of identified studies allowed us to calculate meta-regression for the subcategory training volume only. no single training volume variable significantly predicted rt effects on measures of muscle morphology. additional training variables were independently computed to detect the largest effect for the single training variable. a training period of 50-53 weeks, a training frequency of three sessions per week, a training volume of two to three sets per exercise, seven to nine repetitions per set, a training intensity from 51 to 69% of the 1rm, a total time under tension of 6.0 s, a rest of 120 s between sets, and a rest of 2.5 s between repetitions turned out to be most effective. limitations: the current results must be interpreted with caution because of the poor overall methodological study quality (mean pedro score 4.6 points) and the considerable large heterogeneity (i2) = 80%, χ2 = 163.1, df = 32, p < 0.01) for muscle strength. in terms of muscle morphology, our search identified nine studies only, which is why we consider our findings preliminary. while we were able to determine a dose-response relationship based on specific individual training variables with respect to muscle strength and morphology, it was not possible to ascertain any potential interactions between these variables. we recognize the limitation that the results may not represent one general dose-response relationship. conclusions: this systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of rt on specific measures of upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle morphology in healthy old adults. in addition, we were able to extract dose-response relationships for key training variables (i.e., volume, intensity, rest), informing clinicians and practitioners to design effective rts for muscle strength and morphology. training period, intensity, time under tension, and rest in between sets play an important role in improving muscle strength and morphology and should be implemented in exercise training programs targeting healthy old adults. still, further research is needed to reveal optimal dose-response relationships following rt in healthy as well as mobility limited and/or frail old adults.']"

means (sd)] and for comparison in a group of young men [ym, aged 25.3 yr (sd 4.4), height 176.4 cm (sd 7.7), weight 79.1 kg (sd 11.9)]. gl muscle volume (vol) and achilles tendon moment arm length were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. pennation angle and fiber fascicle length (lf) were measured using b-mode ultrasonography during isometric maximum voluntary contraction of the plantar flexors. pcsa was estimated as vol/lf. gl ff was calculated by dividing achilles tendon force by the cosine of theta, during the interpolation of a supramaximal doublet, and accounting for antagonist activation level (assessed using emg), achilles tendon moment arm length, and the relative pcsa of the gl within the plantar flexor group. voluntary activation of the plantar flexors was lower in the em than in the ym (86 vs. 98%, respectively, p < 0.05). compared with the ym, plantar flexor maximal voluntary contraction torque and ff of the em were lower by 47 and 40%, respectively (p < 0.01). both vol and pcsa were smaller in the em by 28% (p < 0.01) and 16% (p < 0.05), respectively. also, pennation angle was 12% smaller in the em, whereas there was no significant difference in lf between the ym and em. after accounting for differences in agonists and antagonists activation, the ff/pcsa of the em was 30% lower than that of the ym (p < 0.01). these findings demonstrate that the loss of muscle strength with aging may be explained not only by a reduction in voluntary drive to the muscle, but mostly by a decrease in intrinsic muscle force. this phenomenon may possibly be due to a reduction in single-fiber specific tension.', 'reported specific tension measurements for human skeletal muscle vary widely. this variability could be due, at least in part, to the determination of the physiological cross-sectional area (pcsa) of the muscles. in the present study, serial magnetic resonance images were taken every 10 mm along the lower leg of 8 male subjects to calculate the volume and subsequently the pcsas of the individual muscles producing plantar flexor and dorsiflexor torques. maximum plantar flexor and dorsiflexor voluntary isometric torques were determined at ankle joint angles of 90, 100, 110, and 120 degrees. peak tendon force estimated from torque and moment arm measurements was more than fourfold higher in the plantar flexors (3,623 +/- 136 n) than in the dorsiflexors (832 +/- 19 n). pcsas were about eight- and threefold higher than the anatomic cross-sectional areas at the level of maximum girth of the calf for the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor groups, respectively. mean muscle volume and pcsa were 4.6 and 12 times larger in the plantar flexors compared with the dorsiflexors, respectively. the pcsas of both plantar flexors (r = 0.92) and dorsiflexors (r = 0.80) were highly correlated with the tendon tension of the respective muscle groups. the maximum specific tension was more than twofold higher in dorsiflexors than in plantar flexors. these data suggest that factors other than pcsa contribute to the force output potential of ankle plantar flexors and dorsiflexors in humans.']"

muscle tone and (2) the activation of spinal locomotor centers induced by specific treadmill training. tension development is different from normal during spastic gait and appears to be independent of exaggerated monosynaptic stretch reflexes. exaggerated stretch reflexes are associated with an absence or reduction of functionally essential polysynaptic reflexes. based on observations of the locomotor capacity of the spinal cat, recent studies have indicated that spinal locomotor centers can be activated and trained in patients with complete or incomplete paraplegia when the body is partially unloaded. the level of electromyographic activity in the gastrocnemius muscle, however, is considerably lower in patients with central motor lesions than in persons without neurological impairments. during the course of a daily locomotor training program, the amplitude of gastrocnemius muscle electromyographic activity increases during the stance phase and inappropriate tibialis anterior muscle activity decreases. such training programs can improve the ability of patients with incomplete paraplegia to walk on stationary surfaces. this article reviews the pathophysiology and functional importance of increased muscle tone and the effects of treadmill training on the locomotor pattern underlying new attempts to improve the mobility of patients with paraplegia.', 'it is generally accepted that neural factors play an important role in muscle strength gains. this article reviews the neural adaptations in strength, with the goal of laying the foundations for practical applications in sports medicine and rehabilitation. an increase in muscular strength without noticeable hypertrophy is the first line of evidence for neural involvement in acquisition of muscular strength. the use of surface electromyographic (semg) techniques reveal that strength gains in the early phase of a training regimen are associated with an increase in the amplitude of semg activity. this has been interpreted as an increase in neural drive, which denotes the magnitude of efferent neural output from the cns to active muscle fibres. however, semg activity is a global measure of muscle activity. underlying alterations in semg activity are changes in motor unit firing patterns as measured by indwelling (wire or needle) electrodes. some studies have reported a transient increase in motor unit firing rate. training-related increases in the rate of tension development have also been linked with an increased probability of doublet firing in individual motor units. a doublet is a very short interspike interval in a motor unit train, and usually occurs at the onset of a muscular contraction. motor unit synchronisation is another possible mechanism for increases in muscle strength, but has yet to be definitely demonstrated. there are several lines of evidence for central control of training-related adaptation to resistive exercise. mental practice using imagined contractions has been shown to increase the excitability of the cortical areas involved in movement and motion planning. however, training using imagined contractions is unlikely to be as effective as physical training, and it may be more applicable to rehabilitation. retention of strength gains after dissipation of physiological effects demonstrates a strong practice effect. bilateral contractions are associated with lower semg and strength compared with unilateral contractions of the same muscle group. semg magnitude is lower for eccentric contractions than for concentric contractions. however, resistive training can reverse these trends. the last line of evidence presented involves the notion that unilateral resistive exercise of a specific limb will also result in training effects in the unexercised contralateral limb (cross-transfer or cross-education). peripheral involvement in training-related strength increases is much more uncertain. changes in the sensory receptors (i.e. golgi tendon organs) may lead to disinhibition and an increased expression of muscular force. agonist muscle activity results in limb movement in the desired direction, while antagonist activity opposes that motion. both decreases and increases in co-activation of the antagonist have been demonstrated. a reduction in antagonist co-activation would allow increased expression of agonist muscle force, while an increase in antagonist co-activation is important for maintaining the integrity of the joint. thus far, it is not clear what the cns will optimise: force production or joint integrity. the following recommendations are made by the authors based on the existing literature. motor learning theory and imagined contractions should be incorporated into strength-training practice. static contractions at greater muscle lengths will transfer across more joint angles. submaximal eccentric contractions should be used when there are issues of muscle pain, detraining or limb immobilisation. the reversal of antagonists (antagonist-to-agonist) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation contraction pattern would be useful to increase the rate of tension development in older adults, thus serving as an important prophylactic in preventing falls. when evaluating the neural changes induced by strength training using emg recording, antagonist emg activity should always be measured and evaluated.', 'following central motor lesions, two forms of adaptation can be observed which lead to improved mobility: (1) the development of spastic muscle tone, and (2) the activation of spinal locomotor centers induced by specific treadmill training. tension development during spastic gait is different from that during normal gait and appears to be independent of exaggerated monosynaptic stretch reflexes. exaggerated stretch reflexes are associated with an absence or reduction of functionally essential polysynaptic reflexes. when supraspinal control of spinal reflexes is impaired, the inhibition of monosynaptic reflexes is missing in addition to a reduced facilitation of polysynaptic reflexes. therefore, overall leg muscle activity becomes reduced and less well modulated in patients with spasticity. electrophysiological and histological studies have shown that a transformation of motor units takes place following central motor lesions with the consequence that regulation of muscle tone is achieved at a lower level of neuronal organization which in turn enables the patient to walk. based on observations of the locomotor capacity of the spinal cat, recent studies have indicated that spinal locomotor centers can be activated and trained in patients with complete or incomplete paraplegia when the body is partially unloaded. however, the level of electromyographic activity in the gastrocnemius (the main antigravity muscle during gait) is considerably lower in the patients compared to healthy subjects. during the course of a daily locomotor training program, the amplitude of gastrocnemius, electromyographic activity increases significantly during the stance phase, while inappropriate tibialis anterior activation decreases. patients with incomplete paraplegia benefit from such training programs such that their walking ability on a stationary surface improves. the pathophysiology and functional significance of spastic muscle tone and the effects of treadmill training on the locomotor pattern underlying new attempts to improve the mobility of patients with paraplegia are reviewed.']"

tension. several in vitro studies have indicated that the cyclic gmp and cyclic amp-mediated signaling may play a role in the control of human ureteral muscle. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the functional effects of pde5 inhibitors sildenafil (sil), vardenafil (var) and tadalafil (tad), as well as nitric oxide (no)-donating agent sodium nitroprusside (snp) and non-selective muscarinic antagonist butylscopolamine (bsc) on the tension induced by kcl and the turnover of cyclic nucleotides in isolated human ureteral smooth muscle. in vitro relaxant responses of human ureteral smooth muscle to the pde5 inhibitors mentioned above were investigated using the organ bath technique. cyclic nucleotides camp and cgmp were determined by means of specific radioimmunoassay following incubation of the tissue with sil, var, tad and snp. the tension induced by kcl of the ureteral tissue was dose dependently reversed by the drugs with the following rank order of efficacy: snp > var >or= sil > tad > bsc. r(max) values ranged from 25 +/- 9% (snp) to 5 +/- 3% (bsc). relaxant responses were paralleled by threefold to fourfold increase in tissue levels of cgmp. our results indicate that pde5 inhibitors can reverse the tension of isolated human ureteral smooth muscle via cgmp-mediated pathways. nevertheless, further studies are indicated in order to evaluate as to whether there might be a use for pde5 inhibitors in the treatment of ureteral stone disease.', 'phosphodiesterases (pde) are key enzymes regulating intracellular cyclic nucleotide turnover and, thus,

human ureteral smooth muscle were investigated in vitro using the organ bath technique. cyclic nucleotides camp and cgmp were determined by specific radioimmunoassay following time and dose-dependent

and pde5 inhibitors e 4021 and morpholinosulfonyl-pyrazolopyrimidine (mspp). relaxing potency of the drugs was paralleled by their ability to elevate intracellular levels of cgmp and camp, respectively. our data suggest the possibility of using selective inhibitors of pde isoenzymes 4 and 5 in the treatment of ureteral stones and ureteral colic.', 'results from basic research implicate a role for bioactive peptides in controlling the mammalian lower urinary tract. although various peptides are assumed to be involved in the potentiaton or inhibition of cholinergic or purinergic activity in the urinary bladder, there is still much controversy regarding the mode of action and functional significance of such peptides in detrusor smooth muscle. thus, we evaluated the functional effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (anp), calcitonin gene related peptide (cgrp), endothelin 1 (et-1), substance p (sp) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip) on isolated strip preparations of human detrusor smooth muscle and determined the presence of those peptides in the human detrusor by means of immunohistochemistry. the effects of peptides on isometric tension of isolated detrusor strip preparations and on tissue levels of cyclic nucleotides camp and cgmp were compared to those of adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (f), nitric oxide donor na(+)-nitroprusside (snp) and non-specific phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitor papaverine (p). the effects of the compounds on isometric tension of isolated human detrusor smooth muscle were examined using the organ bath technique. to determine time- and dose-dependent effects on cyclic nucleotide levels, bladder strips were exposed to increasing doses of f, snp, p, anp, cgrp and vip, then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenised in the frozen state. camp and cgmp were extracted and assayed using specific radioimmunoassays. the presence of peptides was investigated by light microscopy using the avidin-biotin-complex (abc) method. f, p and vip most effectively reversed the carbachol-induced tension of isolated human detrusor strips. relaxing effects of anp, cgrp and snp were negligible. in contrast, et-1 and sp elicited dose-dependent contractions of the tissue. the relaxing effects of f, p and vip were accompanied by an increase in camp and cgmp levels, respectively. light microscopy revealed positive immunostaining for cgrp, et 1, vip and sp in sections of the detrusor muscle coat. our results suggest a possible importance of et 1, sp and vip in regulating detrusor smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. even if a peptide is not synthesised, stored or released in a smooth muscle tissue and is, therefore, unable to reach its target cells under physiologic conditions, a functional effect on the tissue might be mediated by peptide-binding to specific cell surface receptors.']"

glenohumeral rotational centre and of the deltoid muscle length is essential to understand optimal placement of a total shoulder prosthesis. this study is designed to analyse the effect of deltoid muscle elongation on shoulder joint function. design: a three-dimensional model of the glenohumeral joint with deltoid muscle analysis in the scapular plane. methods: a geometrical three-dimensional ball-and-socket model of the shoulder joint was developed. from dry bones, the position of the origins and insertions of the three parts of the deltoid muscle relative to the calculated centre of rotation of the humeral head was defined. the position and the direction of the muscle force working lines relative to this humeral centre were calculated using former measurements and ct-data of the deltoid. muscle length-tension data were applied to obtain angle-force relationships. the model was used to calculate the angle-force relationships, the moment arm and the moment of the deltoid muscle components for successive arm elevation angles in the scapular plane. these data were compared to those of a theoretical situation assuming a 10% elongation of the muscle. results: muscle angle-force curves show a more favourable slope after moderate (10%) deltoid muscle elongation. elongating the muscle by changing the distance between the humeral rotation point and the deltoid insertion along the humeral axis does not affect moment arms. the moments of the deltoid muscle forces themselves, however, seem more adapted to elevation in the scapular plane. the deltoid maximal moment exceeds the arm-weight moment by about 40% instead of being approximately equal, and that the maximum is situated around 100 degrees of elevation. conclusions: from a biomechanical point of view, stretching the deltoid muscle by 10% seems to result in a significantly more favourable position in case of shoulder elevation at 90 degrees of abduction in the scapular plane in a centred glenohumeral joint. relevance: this model suggests that a 10% elongation of the deltoid muscle, the most important shoulder abductor, improves its ability to elevate the arm. if properly implemented, this observation can

pc35v35(c]. in vitro smooth muscle sensitivity to histamine of bronchial tissue obtained at thoracotomy was expressed as the concentration causing a 50% maximum contraction (ec50) and as the maximum tension generated. there was considerable variation between patients in the in vivo responsiveness but a relatively narrow range for in vitro responses. there was no significant correlation between in vivo responsiveness, either with or without atropine pretreatment, and in vitro results. the asthmatic patient showed hyperresponsiveness in vivo but but not in vitro. these results suggest that in vitro airway smooth muscle sensitivity to histamine is not the sole determinant of in vivo airway responsiveness and that this lack of relationship is not explained by the influence of vagal nerve input on in vivo measurements. the results in the asthmatic patient suggest that airway hyperresponsiveness may be an in vivo phenomenon which is not related to a primary abnormality of airway smooth muscle.', 'the potent bronchoconstrictor and mitogenic actions of the peptide endothelin-1 (et-1) on airway smooth muscle may contribute significantly to the bronchial obstruction observed in asthma. however, the status of the receptor-effector systems that mediate these actions of et-1 in asthmatic airways is currently unknown. thus, we have used quantitative autoradiographic and isometric-tension recording techniques to evaluate the density, distribution, and function of the specific receptors that mediate the actions of et-1 in both asthmatic and nonasthmatic airways. here, we report that similar numbers of specific binding sites for [125i]-et-1 exist in asthmatic and nonasthmatic airways, with the greatest densities located in airway smooth muscle in both tissue types. the etb-receptor subtype constituted approximately 82% and 88% of these receptors for et-1 in asthmatic and nonasthmatic human bronchial smooth muscle, respectively, and mediated contraction in response to this peptide. in addition, a component of et-1-induced contraction appeared to be mediated by a non-etb, bq-123-resistant mechanism. furthermore, a small population of eta sites was identified that did not mediate contraction, but which may have a role in et-1-induced prostanoid release and airway smooth-muscle proliferation. interestingly, bronchial smooth muscle from asthmatic lung was significantly less sensitive to the contractile effects of etb receptor activation, consistent with desensitization of this receptor subtype in response to the increased production and release of et-1 that occurs in this disease.', 'we have examined the in vivo airway responsiveness to leukotriene (lt) d4 in 11 patients without asthma who were to undergo thoracotomy and compared this responsiveness with in vitro sensitivity and in vitro contractility of bronchial smooth muscle to ltd4. in vivo responses were measured by the provocation concentration producing a 10% fall in fev1, a 30% fall in partial flow rate at 30% of total lung capacity from a partial forced expiratory maneuver, and a 35% fall in specific airway conductance. in vitro sensitivity was measured as the concentration of ltd4 producing a 50% of maximum contraction and maximum-induced tension. the smooth muscle content of the bronchial strip was estimated microscopically, and the absolute quantity of muscle strip was compared with the maximum tension generated by that bronchial smooth muscle sample. in vivo results varied over 2 log units, and in vitro sensitivity, over 1 log unit. the absolute amount of smooth muscle present in bronchial strips correlated with maximal ltd4-induced tension. there was no relationship between in vivo responsiveness and in vitro sensitivity nor between in vivo responsiveness and maximum tension generated, even when this was corrected for the proportion of smooth muscle present in each bronchial strip. these results suggest that in vivo airway responsiveness to ltd4 is not determined by airway smooth muscle sensitivity or its ability to generate tension alone. other factors must be influencing the response of the airway to ltd4. nevertheless, the finding of a positive correlation between the absolute amount of smooth muscle present in bronchial strips and maximal ltd4-induced tension suggests that hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle may contribute to in vivo airway hyperresponsiveness.']"

responses reflect the need to improve gas exchange in the lung, and to enhance the delivery of blood to hypoxic systemic tissues. an important unresolved question relates to the underlying mechanism by which the vascular cells detect a decrease in oxygen tension and translate that into a signal that triggers the functional response. a growing body of work implicates the mitochondria, which appear to function as o2 sensors by initiating a redox-signaling pathway that leads to the activation of downstream effectors that regulate vascular tone. however, the direction of this redox signal has been the subject of controversy. part of the problem has been the lack of appropriate tools to assess redox signaling in live cells. recent advancements in the development of redox sensors have led to studies that help to clarify the nature of the hypoxia-induced redox signaling by reactive oxygen species (ros). moreover, these studies provide valuable insight regarding the basis for discrepancies in earlier studies of the hypoxia-induced mechanism of redox signaling. based on recent work, it appears that the o2 sensing mechanism in both the pa and sa are identical, that mitochondria function as the site of o2 sensing, and that increased ros release from these organelles leads to the activation of cell-specific, downstream vascular responses.', 'in lung vasculature, reversible constriction of smooth muscle cells exists in response to acute decrease in oxygen levels (hypoxia). progressive and irreversible structural remodeling that reduces blood vessel lumen takes place in response to chronic hypoxia and results in pulmonary hypertension. several studies have shown a role of serotonin in regulating acute and chronic hypoxic responses. in this review the contribution of serotonin, its receptors and transporter in lung hypoxic responses is discussed. hypoxic conditions modify plasma levels of serotonin, serotonin transporter activity, and expression of 5-ht1b and 5-ht2b receptors. these appear to be required for pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, which depends on the ratio between reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. a heterozygous mutation was identified in the 5-ht2b receptor gene of a patient who developed pulmonary hypertension after fenfluramines anorexigen treatment. this c-terminus truncated 5-ht2b mutant receptor presents lower nitric oxide coupling, and higher cell proliferation capacity than the wild-type receptor. under low oxygen tension, cells increase the transcription of specific genes via stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1. factors such as angiotensin ii or thrombin that can also control hif-1 pathway contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling. the 5-ht2b receptor via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/akt activates nuclear factor-kappab, which is involved in the regulation of hif-1 expression. acontrol of hif- 1 by 5-ht2b receptors explains why expression of pulmonary vascular remodeling factors, such as endothelin-1 or transforming growth factor-beta, which is hif-1-alpha regulated, is not modified in hypoxic 5-ht2b receptor mutant mice. understanding the detailed mechanisms involved in lung hypoxic responses may provide general insight into pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis.', '1. changes in the environmental oxygen tension to which cells are exposed in vivo result in physiological and sometimes pathological consequences that are associated with differential expression of specific genes. 2. low oxygen tension (hypoxia) affects endothelial cellular physiology in vivo and in vitro in a number of ways, including the transcriptionally regulated expression of vasoactive substances and matrix proteins involved in modulating vascular tone or remodelling the vasculature and surrounding tissue. 3. hypoxia results in the transcriptional induction of genes encoding vasoconstrictors and smooth muscle mitogens (pdgf-b, endothelin-1, vegf, thrombospondin-1) and genes encoding matrix or remodelling molecules (collagenase iv (mmp-9), thrombospondin-1) and reciprocal transcriptional inhibition of vasodilatory or anti-mitogenic effectors (enos). 4. oxygen appears to signal through a novel haem-containing sensor and signals initiated by this sensor alter the levels and dna-binding activity of transcription factors such as activating protein (ap)-1, nuclear factor-kappa b and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1. 5. the genes encoding vasoactive factors regulated by oxygen tension are themselves also regulated by the vasoactive agent nitric oxide (no). 6. nitric oxide and oxygen transduce similar signals (i.e. their absence results in identical patterns of gene expression in endothelial cells and other cell types). 7. thus, no can feedback on and modulate signals induced by hypoxia and vice versa. for example, no, which can act directly on smooth muscle cells as a vasodilator, can also facilitate vasodilation indirectly by reversing the production of vasoconstrictors induced by hypoxia. 8. short-term exposure of endothelial cells to low oxygen tension results in the elaboration of predominantly vasoconstricting effectors, while longer-term and more severe hypoxic exposure generates factors that can induce smooth muscle proliferation and remodelling. 9. thus, the endothelial cell response to hypoxic stress can result in two different consequences in the surrounding tissues, depending on the duration of the exposure: short-term exposure causes physiological and reversible modulation of vascular tone and blood flow; chronic hypoxic stress results in irreversible remodelling of the vasculature and surrounding tissues, with smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. 10. this dichotomy of responses to hypoxia may explain, in part, both the acute and chronic pathophysiological sequelae of diseases characterized by regional hypoxia, including atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, sickle cell disease and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).']"

complex. activation of the small gtpase cdc42, a specific n-wasp activator, is also required for actin polymerization and tension generation. we assessed the mechanism by which rhoa regulates actin dynamics and smooth muscle contraction by expressing the dominant negative mutants rhoa t19n and cdc42 t17n, and non-phosphorylatable paxillin y118/31f and paxillin δld4 deletion mutants in sm

ach induced paxillin phosphorylation and its association with the cdc42 gefs, dock180 and α/βpix. paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with βpix were rhoa-dependent, and were required

approximately 150-nm depth, which indicates the same order of magnitude as that of the horizontal and vertical size of fas, respectively. the cell migration and intracellular structures were analyzed by live cell imaging and confocal fluorescence microscopy. the intracellular tension was also assessed using atomic force microscopy (afm). results: vsmcs presenting well-aligned actin stress fibers with mature fas revealed marked cell elongation and directional migration on the grooves; however, hela cells with nonoriented f-actin with smaller fas did not. the internal force of the actin fibers was significantly higher in vsmcs than that in hela cells, and the increase or decrease in the cytoskeletal forces improved or diminished the sensing ability for shallow grooves, respectively. the results strongly indicated that directional cell migration should be modulated by cell type-specific cytoskeletal arrangements and intracellular traction forces. the differences in cell type-specific orientation and migration responses can be emphasized on the microgrooves as large as the horizontal and vertical size of fas. conclusion: the microgoove structure in the size range of the fa protein

p < 0.01). both adult groups had greater values than the children (p < 0.01) but there were no differences between boys (5.2 kn, 99 cm(2)) and girls (6.1 kn, 102 cm(2)). agonist activation was greater in men and women than in girls (p < 0.05), and antagonist activation was greater in men than in boys (p < 0.05). moment arm length was greater in men than in boys or girls and greater in women than in boys (p < 0.05). the angle of pennation did not differ between the groups in any of the quadriceps heads. the specific tension was similar (p > 0.05) between groups: men, 55 +/- 11 n cm(-2); women, 57.3 +/- 13 n cm(-2); boys, 54 +/- 14 n cm(-2); and girls, 59.8 +/- 15 n cm(-2). these findings indicate that the increased muscle strength with maturation is not due to an increase in the specific tension of muscle; instead, it can be attributed to increases in muscle size, moment arm length and voluntary activation level.']"

conservative decision making. design: video description of a case, demonstrating a step-by-step explanation of the decision planning and description of the surgical steps in a female patient with bilateral ureteral endometriosis who had previously undergone operation for bowel endometriosis, and who presented with extensive disease in the posterior compartment with no symptoms besides bilateral renal function disruption. the study was reviewed and approved by the hospital beneficência portuguesa de são paulo institutional review board. setting: tertiary referral center. patients: deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the ureter has an incidence of 0.1% to 1%, normally affecting the lower one-third of its segment, up to 4 cm above the vesicoureteric junction. bilateral ureteral involvement occurs in 9% of cases. the absence of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis of this condition challenging. lumbar pain develops when its involvement is complicated by marked obstruction with impaired renal function. decompressive surgery is mandatory. the necessity of ureteroneocystostomy increases along with the severity of hydronephrosis, accounting for 62% of ureteral decompressive procedures. however, bilateral ureteroneocystostomy is a rare procedure, not exceeding 6% of ureteral reimplantations. this case illustrates a situation in which a patient with a previous bowel segmental resection presented with an advanced bilateral posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis, compromising the lower rectum below the previous anastomosis, vagina, posterior, and lateral parametrium bilaterally and both inferior hypogastric plexi. hormonal therapy improved endometriosis symptoms but did not control the urinary tract involvement. along with the patient, considering a high probability of intestinal, urinary, and sexual impairment, a conservative approach was chosen. intervention: the procedure started with adesiolysis, accessing the retroperitoneum and identifying both dilated ureters (figs. 1 and 2). they were dissected as caudally as possible, until endometriosis fibrosis was reached, to have a bigger length of proximal ureter to allow a tension-free ureteroneocystostomy. the retzius space was developed, and the bladder was freed and mobilized (fig. 3). after cutting the ureter, the proximal end was spatulated. the bladder dome was approximated to the psoas muscle with an interrupted suture to permit a tension-free ureteroneocystostomy. the detrusor muscle was opened for approximately 2 to 3 cm, exposing the vesical mucosa, which was subsequently opened. the posterior ureterovesical anastomosis was performed with running monofilament absorbable 4-0 sutures. a double-j stent was placed, and the anterior ureterovesical anastomosis was completed. the detrusor muscle was loosely closed over the ureter with interrupted absorbable sutures to avoid urinary reflux. a maryland clamp was used to ensure sufficient entry of the tunnel. all these steps were repeated in the contralateral side. main outcome measure(s): successful performance of a bilateral laparoscopy tension-free ureteroneocystostomy with bilateral psoas hitch. results: the postoperative course was uneventful. renal function was restored. one year after surgery, the patient remained asymptomatic, and endometriotic lesions showed no increase, thus remaining stable. conclusion: ureteral endometriosis can be aggressive and indolent. decompressive procedures must be performed. the decision-making process must take into consideration the patient's characteristics and expectations. in selected cases, a conservative approach may be required, when future possible functional disfunctions can be worse than the actual symptoms. in those situations, close surveillance is necessary."", 'the tension-free vaginal tape (tvt) procedure has long been considered the gold standard for female stress incontinence. since its introduction in 1995, several other tapes and other minimally invasive treatments have arisen. the transobturator tape (tot) procedure reproduces the natural suspension of the urethra through the obturator and puborectalis muscles. the tot procedure was reportedly developed in an effort to prevent bladder perforation associated with the tvt and is generally considered to be a procedure with low morbidity. at our institution, we report the first case of infected mesh with subsequent myositis of adductor muscles after a tot procedure. to our knowledge, this is the first case reporting this complication, citing specifically that the anatomical structures traversed by the tape, including both muscle and fascia, can be at risk for infection and ultimately require removal of the sling material. we performed a medline literature search using key words such as ""transobturator tape,"" ""tension free vaginal tape,"" and ""adductor and obturator complications"" to ascertain any reported adductor or obturator muscle complications after placement of tot. further, we reviewed the literature to elucidate the consequences of using different mesh materials, specifically their effects on erosion. we reported our case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with right-leg cellulitis and vaginal discharge after having a tot placed for stress incontinence. inflammation of the adductor muscles was demonstrated on computed tomography (ct) scan and ultrasound. on physical exam, the mesh had visibly eroded through the vaginal wall. our patient underwent excision of the mesh material. she ultimately had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home in good condition on the postoperative day 2. the mesh material removed was obtape. we believe our study is the first case report to discuss the complication of infected adductor muscles and erosion of the tape during post-tot procedure. after a careful review of the literature, there is no mention of myositis of adductor muscles as a possible complication after the tot procedure. in fact, the literature has deemed this minimally invasive treatment as a safe and effective procedure with minimal complications including only de novo urgency or urinary retention. the site of infection is of particular interest and can be explained by the course through the anatomical structures that are unique to this particular procedure. ultimately, the treatment for this procedure was the removal of the mesh along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. in conclusion, the burden falls upon the surgeons to report in a timely fashion both successes and complication for the tot procedure given their relatively limited experience. this is paramount in determining patients\' risks.', 'external anal sphincter contractility significantly contributes to control the passage of stool. an artificial anal sphincter placed into the intersphincteric space is a safe and effective procedure to treat fecal incontinence, even if its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. the aim of this study was to evaluate external anal sphincter contractility changes after a self-expandable hyexpan prostheses was implanted into the intersphincteric space of the anal canal and clinical outcomes compared. design: this was a prospective clinical study. settings: the study was conducted at a university teaching hospital. patients: consecutive patients affected by fecal incontinence for at least 6 months after failure of conservative treatment were included. interventions: all of the patients underwent 10-prostheses implantation and were examined preoperatively and postoperatively by endoanal ultrasound and anorectal manometry. main outcome measures: fecal incontinence symptoms were assessed by severity scores. the external anal sphincter muscle tension was calculated using a specific equation. results: thirty-nine patients (34 women; median age = 68 y) were included in the study; no morbidity was registered. after a median follow-up period of 14 months, both the median maximum voluntary squeeze pressure and the median inner radius of the external anal sphincter significantly increased. a statistically significant increase of external anal sphincter muscle tension was detected. a decrease of any fecal incontinence symptom and an improvement in severity scores were observed at the last follow-up examination. the external anal sphincter contractility was significantly higher in patients reducing incontinence episodes to solid stool by >50% and improving their ability to defer defecation for >15 minutes. limitations: this was a single-center experience with a relatively small and heterogeneous sample size, patients with a potentially more severe disease because our institution is a referral center, and an absence of quality-of-life evaluation. conclusions: artificial anal sphincter implantation improved the external anal sphincter muscle tension; there was a positive correlation between its increase and the

however, skeletal muscle protein synthesis appears to be regulated by the multi-protein phosphorylation cascade, mtorc1 (mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1). the purpose of this review is to examine the physiological response to resistance exercise, with particular emphasis on the endocrine response and intramuscular anabolic signaling through mtorc1. it appears that resistance exercise protocols that maximize muscle fiber recruitment, time-under-tension, and metabolic stress will contribute to maximizing intramuscular anabolic signaling; however, the resistance exercise parameters for maximizing the anabolic response remain unclear.', ""muscle soreness typically occurs after intense exercise, unaccustomed exercise or actions that involve eccentric contractions where the muscle lengthens while under tension. it peaks between 24 and 72 hours after the initial bout of exercise. many people take antioxidant supplements or antioxidant-enriched foods before and after exercise in the belief that these will prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise. to assess the effects (benefits and harms) of antioxidant supplements and antioxidant-enriched foods for preventing and reducing the severity and duration of delayed onset muscle soreness following exercise. search methods: we searched the cochrane bone, joint and muscle trauma group specialised register, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, medline, embase, sportdiscus, trial registers, reference lists of articles and conference proceedings up to february 2017. selection criteria: we included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of all forms of antioxidant supplementation including specific antioxidant supplements (e.g. tablets, powders, concentrates) and antioxidant-enriched foods or diets on preventing or reducing delayed onset muscle soreness (doms). we excluded studies where antioxidant supplementation was combined with another supplement. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently screened search results, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from included trials using a pre-piloted form. where appropriate, we pooled results of comparable trials, generally using the random-effects model. the outcomes selected for presentation in the 'summary of findings' table were muscle soreness, collected at times up to 6 hours, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-exercise, subjective recovery and adverse effects. we assessed the quality of the evidence using grade. main results: fifty randomised, placebo-controlled trials were included, 12 of which used a cross-over design. of the 1089 participants, 961 (88.2%) were male and 128 (11.8%) were female. the age range for participants was between 16 and 55 years and training status varied from sedentary to moderately trained. the trials were heterogeneous, including the timing (pre-exercise or post-exercise), frequency, dose, duration and type of antioxidant supplementation, and the type of preceding exercise. all studies used an antioxidant dosage higher than the recommended daily amount. the majority of trials (47) had design features that carried a high risk of bias due to selective reporting and poorly described allocation concealment, potentially limiting the reliability of their findings.we tested only one comparison: antioxidant supplements versus control (placebo). no studies compared high-dose versus low-dose, where the low-dose supplementation was within normal or recommended levels for the antioxidant involved.pooled results for muscle soreness indicated a small difference in favour of antioxidant supplementation after doms-inducing exercise at all main follow-ups: up to 6 hours (standardised mean difference (smd) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (ci) -0.56 to -0.04; 525 participants, 21 studies; low-quality evidence); at 24 hours (smd -0.13, 95% ci -0.27 to 0.00; 936 participants, 41 studies; moderate-quality evidence); at 48 hours (smd -0.24, 95% ci -0.42 to -0.07; 1047 participants, 45 studies; low-quality evidence); at 72 hours (smd -0.19, 95% ci -0.38 to -0.00; 657 participants, 28 studies; moderate-quality evidence), and little difference at 96 hours (smd -0.05, 95% ci -0.29 to 0.19; 436 participants, 17 studies; low-quality evidence). when we rescaled to a 0 to 10 cm scale in order to quantify the actual difference between groups, we found that the 95% cis for all five follow-up times were all well below the minimal important difference of 1.4 cm: up to 6 hours (md -0.52, 95% ci -0.95 to -0.08); at 24 hours (md -0.17, 95% ci -0.42 to 0.07); at 48 hours (md -0.41, 95% ci -0.69 to -0.12); at 72 hours (md -0.29, 95% ci -0.59 to 0.02); and at 96 hours (md -0.03, 95% ci -0.43 to 0.37). thus, the effect sizes suggesting less muscle soreness with antioxidant supplementation were very unlikely to equate to meaningful or important differences in practice. neither of our subgroup analyses to examine for differences in effect according to type of doms-inducing exercise (mechanical versus whole body aerobic) or according to funding source confirmed subgroup differences. sensitivity analyses excluding cross-over trials showed that their inclusion had no important impact on results.none of the 50 included trials measured subjective recovery (return to previous activities without signs or symptoms).there is very little evidence regarding the potential adverse effects of taking antioxidant supplements as this outcome was reported in only nine trials (216 participants). from the studies that did report adverse effects, two of the nine trials found adverse effects. all six participants in the antioxidant group of one trial had diarrhoea and four of these also had mild indigestion; these are well-known side effects of the particular antioxidant used in this trial. one of 26 participants in a second trial had mild gastrointestinal distress. authors' conclusions: there is moderate to low-quality evidence that high dose antioxidant supplementation does not result in a clinically relevant reduction of muscle soreness after exercise at up to 6 hours or at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after exercise. there is no evidence available on subjective recovery and only limited evidence on the adverse effects of taking antioxidant supplements. the findings of, and messages from, this review provide an opportunity for researchers and other stakeholders to come together and consider what are the priorities, and underlying justifications, for future research in this area.""]"

human prostatic et-1 binding sites on slide-mounted tissue sections were defined. maximal specific 125i-et-1 binding was achieved after a 10-min preincubation, a 120-min incubation, and a washing procedure that consisted of a brief rinse and a 1-min wash. the mean equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) and density (bmax) of et-1 binding sites determined from six saturation studies were 0.72 +/- 0.13 nm and 40.4 +/- 6.9 fmol/mg of wet weight, respectively. the mean hill coefficient was 0.99 +/- 0.01, indicating that 125i-et-1 identifies a single population of binding sites. the pharmacology of 125i-et-1 binding sites was characterized using competitive binding experiments. the competition plots for et-1 were best fit by a one-binding site model, whereas the plots for sarafotoxin 6c (s6c) and bq123 were consistently best fit by a two-site model. the mean ki value of et-1 was 0.34 +/- 0.12 nm. the mean ki values for the high and low affinity s6c binding sites were

of prostate smooth muscle. bq123 at concentractions between 0.1 and 10 microm did not shift the s6c dose-response curve. these functional studies suggest that both eta and etb receptors mediate the tension of prostate smooth muscle. endogenous ets may be involved in the pathophysiology of bladder outlet obstruction in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. if this is the case, then et antagonists may represent effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'previous studies have used endothelin (et) receptor agonists and antagonists to localise et receptor subtypes in

prostatic tissues obtained from patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). the contractile properties of the et receptor subtypes as well as the effect of et-1 on alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-mediated prostatic smooth muscle contraction were assessed. patients and methods: saturation binding and quantitative autoradiographic studies were performed using specific radioligands for et(a) and et(b) receptors on prostate sections obtained from patients with bladder outflow obstruction secondary to bph. in vitro isometric tension studies were carried out to characterise the et receptor subtypes in prostatic smooth muscle strips from the same group of patients. in addition, the effect of et-1 on alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-induced prostatic smooth muscle contraction was also investigated. results: there were dense et(a) and et(b) receptor-binding sites in the prostatic stroma. et(a) receptor-binding sites were also prominent on the prostatic

bq788 (et(b) antagonist) significantly inhibited et-1- and s6c-mediated prostatic smooth muscle contractile responses, respectively. et-1 at sub-threshold concentrations significantly enhanced alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-mediated prostatic smooth muscle contractile responses. conclusions: et(a) receptor-binding sites are prominent in both prostatic stroma and epithelium, whereas et(b) receptor-binding sites were predominantly seen in the prostatic stroma in symptomatic bph. both et(a) and et(b) receptors mediate prostatic smooth muscle contraction. et-1 enhances alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-mediated contractile responses, suggesting that et may play a pathophysiological role in bladder outlet obstruction associated with bph.', 'the modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of stamey and coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. they established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the nih classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain syndrome (cpps) and asymptomatic prostatitis. prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (cp/cpps) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. the nihniddk classification based on the use of the microbiological 4- glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. the upoint system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. the upoints algorithm implemented the original upoint adding to the urinary domains (u), psycho-social (p), organspecific (o), infection (i), neurological (n), muscle tension and tenderness (t) a further domain related to sexuality (s). in fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with cp/cpps. prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyperechoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and cpps. use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpmri) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of enterococci has been reported. many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and multidrug- resistance. sexually transmitted infections (sti) agents, in particular chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. on the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other ""genital mycoplasmas"" is still a much debated issue. sexually transmitted infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. ""next generation"" investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. the search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. the success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis for iinitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gramnegative pathogens. the antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. for the treatment of chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. use of alpha-blockers in cp/cpps patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of nsaid is limited by side effect profile. however, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alphablockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. an alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. quercetin, pollen extract, extract of serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. the association of cp/cpps with alterations of intestinal function has been described. diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. the intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. the alteration of the microbiota is called ""dysbiosis"" causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.']"

while much of the current knowledge of human muscle architecture is based on cadaver dissection, modern medical imaging avoids limitations of old age, poor health, and limited subject pool, allowing for muscle architecture data to be obtained in vivo from healthy subjects ranging in size. the purpose of this study was to use novel fast-acquisition mri to quantify volumes and lengths of 35 major lower limb muscles in 24 young, healthy subjects and to determine if muscle size correlates with bone geometry and subject parameters of mass and height. it was found that total lower limb muscle volume scales with mass (r(2)=0.85) and with the height-mass product (r(2)=0.92). furthermore, individual muscle volumes scale with total muscle volume (median r(2)=0.66), with the height-mass product (median r(2)=0.61), and with mass (median r(2)=0.52). muscle volume scales with bone volume (r(2)=0.75), and muscle length relative to bone length is conserved (median s.d.=2.1% of limb length). these relationships allow for an arbitrary subject's individual muscle volumes to be estimated from mass or mass and height while muscle lengths may be estimated from limb length. the dataset presented here can further be used as a normative standard to compare populations with musculoskeletal pathologies."", 'methods for developing mathematical models representing entire human muscles are briefly reviewed, with special emphasis on aspects of modelling velocity dependence using cross-bridge dynamics, and isometric force-length properties from myofilament lengths and muscle architecture. for each of these components, mechanistic (using basic contraction mechanisms) and phenomenological (""black-box"") models are available. experiments on constant-velocity lengthening at different velocities were simulated using (a) a cross-bridge based model and (b) a hill-based model. the hill model was superior in its ability to predict muscle forces under different conditions with the same model parameters. regarding force-length properties, myofilament overlap and muscle architecture did not correctly predict maximal isometric joint moments over the entire functional range of motion. the width of the force-length relationship of all contractile elements in a lower extremity model may be optimized to fit measured isometric moment-angle relationships. the resulting increase in width suggests that for some short-fibered muscles with complex architecture, the ""effective"" muscle fibre length is increased because muscle fibres may be partly connected in series as well as in parallel. it is concluded that a hybrid phenomenological/mechanistic muscle model is most likely to be practical (i.e. parameters can be estimated for human muscle) as well as accurate (i.e. correct forces are predicted for a wide range of conditions.']"

contracture responses in a subject population at low risk for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility to help determine the specificity of the proposed guidelines. subjects were selected arbitrarily from a population of patients undergoing surgery unrelated to performance of a diagnostic muscle biopsy. subjects were admitted to this study and were presumed nonsusceptible if there was no evidence

explain the pathophysiology of disorders of gastric function. the objective of this report is to perform a literature-based critical analysis of new, relevant or conflicting information on gastric sensitivity and reflexes, with particular emphasis on the comprehensive integration of basic and clinical research data. the stomach exerts both phasic and tonic muscular (contractile and relaxatory) activity. gastric tone determines the capacity of the stomach and mediates both gastric accommodation to a meal as well as gastric emptying, by partial relaxation or progressive recontraction, respectively. perception and reflex afferent pathways from the stomach are activated independently by specific stimuli, suggesting that the terminal nerve endings operate as specialized receptors. particularly, perception appears to be related to stimulation of tension receptors, while the existence of volume receptors in the stomach is uncertain. reliable techniques have been developed to measure gastric perception and reflexes both in experimental and clinical conditions, and have facilitated the identification of abnormal responses in patients with gastric disorders. gastroparesis is characterised by impaired gastric tone and contractility, whereas patients with functional dyspepsia have impaired accommodation, associated with antral distention and increased gastric sensitivity. an integrated view of fragmented knowledge allows the design of pathophysiological models in an attempt to explain disorders of gastric function, and may facilitate the development of mechanistically orientated treatments.', 'prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2) ) is an inflammatory mediator implicated in several gastrointestinal pathologies that affect normal intestinal transit. the aim was to establish the contribution of the four ep receptor types (ep(1-4) ), in human colon, that mediate pge(2) -induced longitudinal smooth muscle contraction. methods: changes in isometric muscle tension of human colon, mouse colon and mouse ileum were measured in organ baths in response to receptor-specific agonists and antagonists. in addition, lidocaine was used to block neurogenic activity to investigate whether ep receptors were pre- or post-junctional. key results: pge(2) contracted longitudinal muscle from human and mouse colon and mouse ileum. these contractions were inhibited by the ep(1) receptor antagonist, ep(1) a in human colon, whereas a combination of ep(1) a and the ep(3) antagonist, l798106 inhibited agonist responses in both mouse preparations. the ep(3) agonist, sulprostone also increased muscle tension in both mouse tissues, and these responses were inhibited by lidocaine in the colon but not in the ileum. although pge(2) consistently contracted all three muscle preparations, butaprost decreased tension by activating smooth muscle ep(2) receptors in both colonic tissues. alternatively, in mouse ileum, butaprost responses were lidocaine-sensitive, suggesting that it was activating prejunctional ep(2) receptors on inhibitory motor neurons. conversely, ep(4) receptors were not functional in all the intestinal muscle preparations tested. conclusions & inferences: pge(2) -induced contraction of longitudinal smooth muscle is mediated by ep(1) receptors in human colon and by a combination of ep(1) and ep(3) receptors in mouse intestine, whereas ep(2) receptors modulate relaxation in all three preparations.', 'the peptide hormone ghrelin is known to be present within stomach and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in gut. although reports suggest that gastric function may be modulated by ghrelin acting via the vagus nerve, the gastrointestinal distribution and functions of its receptor, the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (ghs-r), are not clear and may show signs of species-dependency. this study sought to determine the cellular localisation and distribution of ghs-r-immunoreactivity (-ir) using immunofluorescent histochemistry and explore the function of ghrelin in both human and rat isolated gastric and/or colonic circular muscle preparations in which nerve-mediated responses were evoked by electrical field stimulation. the expression of ghs-r-ir differed to a greater extent between species than between gut regions of the same species. both the human and rat gastric and colonic preparations (n=3 each) expressed ghs-r-ir within neuronal cell bodies and fibres, cells associated with gastric glands and putative entero-endocrine and/or mast cells. smooth muscle cells and epithelia were devoid of ghs-r-ir and only rat preparations expressed ghs-r-ir on nerve fibres associated with the muscle layers. ghs-r-ir was fully competed in all cases in pre-adsorption studies and antiserum specificity was confirmed using a cell line transiently expressing the rat ghs-r. in rat isolated forestomach circular muscle, ghrelin 0.1-10 microm had no effect on smooth muscle tension but concentration-dependently facilitated the amplitude of contractions evoked by excitatory nerve stimulation (n=4-7; p<0.05 for each concentration versus vehicle; n=18). when examined under similar conditions, in both rat distal colon (n=4-6, p>0.05 each) and human ascending (n=3) and sigmoid (n=1) colon, these concentrations of ghrelin were without effect (p>0.05 each). the data suggest that ghrelin has the potential to profoundly affect gastrointestinal functions in both species and at least one of these functions is to exert a gastric prokinetic activity. moreover, we suggest that this activity of ghrelin is mediated via the enteric nervous system, in addition to known vagus nerve-dependent mechanisms.']"

camp-dependent kinase) and protein kinase g (pkg; cgmp-dependent kinase), the present study was undertaken to further delineate the functional relation between these pathways in the penis. in addition, the distribution of pka and some camp-binding phosphodiesterases (camp-pdes) were investigated in human erectile tissue. functional experiments were performed on isolated human corpus cavernosum (hcc). the effects of an inhibitor of the pka, rp-8cpt-camps (10 microm), or the pkg, rp-8-pcpt-cgmps (10 microm), on relaxation induced by the cumulative administration of sodium nitroprusside (snp), forskolin, sildenafil or tadalafil (ic351) were studied in preparations of hcc precontracted with 1 microm norepinephrine (ne). using immunohistochemical procedures, the presence of immunoreactivity for camp-pdes pde3, pde4, and pde4a, as well as for pka was investigated in specimens of hcc from which preparations were also used in the functional experiments. forskolin, snp, sildenafil, and ic 351 dose-dependently reversed ne-induced tension of isolated hcc preparations. the relaxing effects of snp were significantly attenuated by rp-8-pcpt-cgmps, but not by rp-8cpt-camps. in contrast, relaxation induced by forskolin, sildenafil and tadalafil were significantly reversed by both rp-8-pcpt-cgmps and rp-8cpt-camps. abundant immunoreactivity for pde3 and pka was observed in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells. immunoreactivity for pde4 was also detected in the smooth musculature and in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining the cavernous sinusoids, as well as in nerve fibres interspersing the trabecular stroma. the present results support the hypothesis of interactions between cgmp- and camp-mediated signals in the hcc, and suggest that the effects of inhibitors of pde5 on isolated erectile tissue may also partly or indirectly include actions of the camp second messenger system. the exact mechanism by which such an interaction occurs is not clear, but it may involve altered activity of the cgmp-inhibited pde3 brought about by a change in the intracellular levels of cgmp by the inhibition of pde5. this will in turn lead to increasing levels of camp, facilitating the interaction of camp with the pka. the immunoreactivity specific for pde3, pde4, pde4a and pka registered in hcc section is also in support of an important role for the camp/pka-system for penile smooth muscle function.', 'it has been well established that male erectile dysfunction is frequently associated with vascular diseases. the normal function of cavernous arteries is considered a prerequisite to maintain sufficient blood flow to the trabecular spaces in order to enable penile erection. contractility of cavernous arteries is regulated by the peripheral autonomic nervous system and endogenous factors released from the endothelial cell layer. a significant increase of blood flow in the central cavernous arteries is the initial event leading to penile tumescence and rigidity. besides the significance of the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp)-mediated mechanisms, the cyclic amp (camp) signalling pathway is also involved in the regulation of tone of the erectile tissue, and interactions between cgmp- and camp-mediated mechanisms have been demonstrated. the aim of the present study was to investigate by means of immunohistochemistry the presence of the phosphodiesterase (pde) isoenzymes 3, 4 (camp-specific pdes) and 5 (cgmp-specific pde) in thin sections of human central cavernous arteries (hca) and their functional significance in the mechanism of vessel tone regulation. methods: functional experiments were performed using circular segments of hca and strip preparations of the human corpus cavernosum (hcc). relaxant effects induced by the cumulative addition of the pde inhibitors milrinone (pde3 inhibitor), rolipram (pde4 inhibitor) and sildenafil (pde5 inhibitor; 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 m) were studied in preparations of hca and hcc challenged by 1 m norepinephrine (ne). moreover, immunohistochemistry was carried out in order to evaluate the expression of pde3, pde4 and pde5 in thin sections of hca. results: milrinone, rolipram and sildenafil dose-dependently reversed the ne-induced tension of the isolated vascular segments and hcc strips with sildenafil being the most effective drug. neither rolipram nor milrinone reached an ec50 value. abundant immunoreactivities specific for pde3, pde4 and pde5 were observed in the entire smooth musculature of the wall of hca and resistance arteries. in addition, immunoreactivity for pde4 was also detected in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining the cavernous arteries. conclusions: the cgmp-dependent relaxation of cavernous arteries is not only dependent on the normal function of the peripheral autonomic nervous system but also on the functional integrity of the vascular endothelium. the expression of the cgmp-specific pde5 and the ability of the pde5 inhibitor sildenafil to reverse the adrenergic tension of isolated segments of hca underline the important role of the no/cgmp pathway in the control of smooth muscle tone of human trabecular smooth musculature and penile cavernous arteries. our results also suggest a significance of the camp-dependent signaling mechanisms in the regulation of tension of central hcas. the present findings are also in support of the hypothesis of interactions between the cgmp- and camp-mediated signaling pathways in hcas. further investigations are indicated in order to outline potential differences between central hcas and helicine resistance arteries. this may help to understand better the relations between structural and functional changes in the penile erectile tissue in patients with cardiovascular diseases and endothelial dysfunction.']"

human body, so it is essential to study the mechanical and structural properties of skeletal muscle. many researchers have carried out mechanical study of skeletal muscle with in-vivo testing. this work aims to examine anisotropic mechanical behavior of skeletal muscle with in vitro test (tensile test). it is important to understand the mechanical and structural behavior of skeletal muscle when it is subjected to external loading; the research aims to determine the structural properties of skeletal muscle by tensile.testing. tensile testing is performed on 5 samples of skeletal muscle of a goat at the rate of 1 mm/min with fiber orientation along the length and 45 degrees inclined to the length. it is found that muscle is stiffer in the direction parallel to the muscle fiber than at 45 degrees to the muscle fibers. the tensile strength of the skeletal muscle along the fiber direction is 0.44 mpa at maximum load of 110 n and for direction 45 degrees inclined to the muscle fibers, the strength is 0.234 mpa at max load 43 n. the displacement of muscle sample against the maximum load is small along the length of the muscle fiber i.e. under longitudinal elongation [15.257 mm] as compared to 45 degrees inclined to the length of skeletal muscle [17.775 mm] and under cross fiber elongation [19.7291 mm by fea]. the testing is not performed for 90 degrees fiber orientation due to unavailability of soft tissue in cross fiber direction of the required specification, but finite element analysis is done on the skeletal muscle for the cross fiber orientation. as the fiber orientation within skeletal muscle differs with respect to the length of the muscle, the stiffness of skeletal muscle is also changing effectively. hence skeletal muscle exhibits the anisotropic mechanical behavior.', 'what is the central question of this study? do the contractile properties of single muscle fibres differ between body-builders, power athletes and control subjects? what is the main finding and its importance? peak power normalized for muscle fibre volume in power athletes is higher than in control subjects. compared with control subjects, maximal isometric tension (normalized for muscle fibre cross-sectional area) is lower in body-builders. although this difference may be caused in part by an apparent negative effect of hypertrophy, these results indicate that the training history of power athletes may increase muscle fibre quality, whereas body-building may be detrimental. we compared muscle fibre contractile properties of biopsies taken from the vastus lateralis of 12 body-builders (bbs; low- to moderate-intensity high-volume resistance training), six power athletes (pas; high-intensity, low-volume combined with aerobic training) and 14 control subjects (cs). maximal isotonic contractions were performed in single muscle fibres, typed with sds-page. fibre cross-sectional area was 67 and 88% (p < 0.01) larger in bbs than in pas and cs, respectively, with no significant difference in fibre cross-sectional area between pas and cs. fibres of bbs and pas developed a higher maximal isometric tension (32 and 50%, respectively, p < 0.01) than those of cs. the specific tension of bb fibres was 62 and 41% lower than that of pa and c fibres (p < 0.05), respectively. irrespective of fibre type, the peak power (pp) of pa fibres was 58% higher than that of bb fibres (p < 0.05), whereas bb fibres, despite considerable hypertrophy, had similar pp to the c fibres. this work suggests that high-intensity, low-volume resistance training with aerobic exercise improves pp, while low- to moderate-intensity high-volume resistance training does not affect pp and results in a reduction in specific tension. we postulate that the decrease in specific tension is caused by differences in myofibrillar density and/or post-translational modifications of contractile proteins.', 'based on the mhc isoform pattern, adult mammalian limb skeletal muscles contain two and, in some species, three types of fast fibers (type iia, iix, and iib), and one slow fiber (type i). slow muscles, such as the soleus, contain primarily the slow type i fiber, whereas fast-twitch muscles are composed primarily of a mixture of the fast myosin isozymes. force generation involves cross-bridge interaction and transition from a weakly bound, low-force state (am-adp-p(i)) to the strongly bound, high-force state (am-adp). this transition is thought to be rate limiting in terms of dp/dt, and the high-force state is the dominant cross-bridge form during a peak isometric contraction. intact fast and slow skeletal muscles generate approximately the same amount of peak force (po) of between 200 and 250 kn.m-2. however, the rate of transition from the low- to high-force state shows ca2+ sensitivity and is 7-fold higher in fast-twitch, as compared to slow-twitch, skeletal muscle fibers. fiber vo or the maximal cross-bridge cycle rate is highly correlated with and thought to be dependent on the specific activity of the myosin or myofibrillar atpase. the hierarchy for vo is the type iib > iix > iia > i. this functional difference for the fast fiber types explains the higher vo observed in the predominantly type iib svl vs. the mixed fast type iia and iib edl muscle. a plot of vo vs. species size demonstrates that an inverse relationship exists between vo and body mass. from the standpoint of work capacity, the important property is power output. an analysis of individual muscles indicates that peak power is obtained at loads considerably below 50% of po. individuals with a high percentage of fast-twitch fibers generate a greater torque and higher power at a given velocity than those with predominantly slow-twitch fibers. in humans, mean peak power occurred in a ratio of 10:5:1 for the type iib, iia, and i fibers. the in vivo measurement of the torque-velocity relationship and vmax in human muscle is difficult because of limitations inherent in the equipment used and the inability to study the large limb muscles independently. nevertheless, the in vivo torque-velocity relationships are similar to those measured in vitro in animals. this observation suggests that little central nervous system inhibition exists and that healthy subjects are able to achieve maximal activation of their muscles. although peak isometric tension is not dependent on fiber type distribution, a positive correlation exists between the percentage of fast fibers and peak torque output at moderate-to-high angular isokinetic velocities. consequently, peak power output is substantially greater in subjects possessing a predominance of fast fibers. the mechanical properties of slow and fast muscles do adapt to programs of regular exercise. endurance exercise training has been shown to increase the vo of the slow soleus by 20%. this increase could have been caused by either a small increase in all, or most, of the fibers, or to a conversion of a few fibers from slow to fast. recently, the increase was shown to be caused by the former, as the individual slow type i fibers of the soleus showed a 20% increase in vo, but there was little or no change in the percentage of fast fibers. the increased vo was correlated with, and likely caused by, an increased fiber atpase. we hypothesize that the increased atpase and cross-bridge cycling speed might be attributable to an increased expression of fast mlcs in the slow type i fibers (fig. 14.10). this hypothesis is based on the fact that light chains have been shown to be involved in the power stroke, and removal of light chains depresses force and velocity. regular endurance exercise training had no effect on fiber size, but with prolonged durations of daily training it depressed po and peak power. when the training is maintained over prolonged periods, it may even induce atrophy of the slow type i and fast type iia fibers.

Biomechanics', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","['the objective of this study was to define the biomechanical properties of the human digital flexor tendons and to compare these biomechanical properties to other muscle-tendon units in the forearm. mechanical measurements were performed on fresh-frozen tendons under physiological load and temperature conditions. loads were determined by first measuring the physiological cross-sectional area of each digital belly of the flexor digitorum superficialis (fds) and flexor digitorum profundus (fdp) and estimating maximum tension (p(o)) of that specific muscle head. loading each tendon to the appropriate p(o) resulted in no significant difference in tendon strain among any of the tendons within each muscle (p > 0.05; digits 2-5) or between muscle types (fdp vs. fds). the one exception to this finding was that a significantly higher strain at po was observed in the fdp tendon to the small finger (p < 0.05). average absolute strains observed for the fdp and fds tendons (1.20 +/- 0.38%, mean +/- sd; n = 39) were significantly lower than those observed previously in a study of the prime movers of the wrist. the measured strain of approximately 1.5% was less than half of that predicted to occur in muscles of this architectural design. modeling sarcomere shortening magnitudes during fdp or fds contraction yielded a value of only 0.10 microm, which would have a negligible effect on the force generating capacity of these muscles. thus the high stiffness of the digital flexor tendons suits them well for fine positional control and would render their muscle spindles quite sensitive to length perturbations at the fingertips.', 'sarcomere length was measured intraoperatively on five patients undergoing tendon transfer of the flexor carpi ulnaris (fcu) to the extensor digitorum communis (edc) for radial nerve palsy. the most significant result was that the absolute sarcomere length and sarcomere length operating range of the fcu increased after transfer into the edc (p < .001). preoperatively, with the wrist fully extended and fingers flexed, fcu sarcomere length was 4.22 +/- .24 microns and decreased to 3.19 +/- .05 microns as the wrist was fully flexed. this represented an overall sarcomere length range of 1.03 microns. after the tendon transfer using standard recommended techniques, all sarcomere lengths were significantly longer (p < .001). specifically, sarcomeres were 0.74 +/- .14 microns longer with the muscle in its fully lengthened position (4.96 +/- .43 microns with the wrist and digits flexed) and 0.31 +/- .16 microns longer with the fcu in the fully shortened position (3.50 +/- .06 microns with the wrist and digits extended). at these sarcomere lengths, the fcu muscle was predicted to develop relatively high force only during movement involving synergistic wrist flexion and finger extension. under the conditions of the procedures performed, the transferred fcu muscle was predicted to produce maximum force over the range of about 30 degrees of wrist flexion and 0 degree of finger flexion to 70 degrees of wrist extension and 90 degrees of finger flexion. while this is acceptable, a more desirable result was predicted to occur if the muscle was transferred at a longer length. in this latter case, greater stretch of the fcu during transfer (increasing sarcomere length to about 5 microns) was predicted to improve the transfer. the more highly stretched fcu was predicted to result in maximum force as the wrist and fingers progressed from about 60 degrees of wrist extension and 0 degree of finger flexion to 80 degrees of wrist extension and 70 degrees of finger flexion. these results quantify the relationship between the passive tension chosen for transfer, sarcomere length, and the estimated active tension that can be generated by the muscle. the results also demonstrate the feasibility of using intraoperative laser diffraction during tendon transfer as a guide for optimal placement of the transferred muscle.', 'tendon transfer is often used to restore key pinch after cervical spinal cord injury. current postoperative recommendations include elbow immobilization in a flexed position to protect the brachioradialis-flexor pollicis longus (br-fpl) repair. the purpose of this study was to measure the br-fpl tendon tension across a range of wrist and elbow joint angles to determine whether joint motion could cause repair rupture. methods: we performed br-to-fpl tendon transfers on fresh-frozen cadaveric arms (n = 8) and instrumented the br-fpl tendon with a buckle transducer. arms were ranged at 4 wrist angles from 45 degrees of flexion to 45 degrees of extension and 8 elbow angles from 90 degrees of flexion to full extension, measuring tension across the br-fpl repair at each angle. subsequently, the br-fpl tendon constructs were removed and elongated to failure. results: over a wide wrist and elbow range of motion, br-fpl tendon tension was under 20 n. two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed a significant effect of wrist joint angle (p<.001) and elbow joint angle (p<.001) with significant interaction between elbow and joint angles (p<.001). because the failure load of the repair site was 203 +/- 19 n, over 10 times the loads that would be expected to occur at the repair site, our results demonstrate that the repair has a safety factor of at least 10. conclusions: our tendon force measurements support the assertion that the elbow joint need not be immobilized when the br is used as a donor muscle in tendon transfer to the fpl. this is based on the fact that maximum passive tendon tension was only about 20 n in our cadaveric model and the failure strength of this specific repair was over 200 n. we suggest that it is possible to consider performing multiple tendon transfers in a single stage, avoiding immobilization, which may adversely affect functional recovery. these results must be qualified by the fact that issues unique to living tissues such as postoperative edema and tendon gliding cannot be accounted for by this cadaveric model.']"

human cgrp i and cgrp ii may act on the same receptor on the ias smooth muscle; and cgrp may not play a significant role in the ias relaxation in response to electrical field stimulation.', 'this study was performed to clarify the possible mechanism behind the ocular hypotensive effect of unoprostone isopropyl (rescula; novartis ophthalmics ag, basel, switzerland), a new docosanoid that has been shown to reduce intraocular pressure (iop) in patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. to gain insight into the possible mode of action, the effects of unoprostone on ciliary muscle (cm) and trabecular meshwork (tm) contractility, intracellular calcium levels, and membrane channels were investigated. methods: the effects of unoprostone (m1 metabolite = free acid, 10(-5) m) and endothelin (et)-1 (10(-9) m) on bovine tm (btm) and ciliary muscle (cm) strips were investigated, by using a custom-made force-length transducer system. the effects of unoprostone and et-1 (5 x 10(-8) m) on intracellular ca(2+) mobilization in cultured human tm (htm) were measured using fura-2am as a fluorescent probe. patch-clamp experiments were performed on htm and btm cells to investigate the unoprostone-dependent modulation of membrane currents. results: in isolated tm and cm strips, unoprostone almost completely inhibited et-induced contractions (tm: 2.9% +/- 4.3% vs. 19.6% +/- 5.7%, p < 0.05, n = 6; cm: 1.4% +/- 1.6% vs. 30.1% +/- 5.3%, p < 0.01, n = 6; 100% = maximal carbachol-induced (10(-6) m) contraction). however, neither carbachol-induced contraction nor baseline tension was affected by unoprostone. furthermore, unoprostone had no effect on baseline intracellular calcium levels (baseline: 126 +/- 45 nm versus unoprostone: 132 +/- 42 nm, n = 8) in htm cells. the endothelin-induced increase (679 +/- 102 nm), however, was almost completely (p < 0.01) blocked by unoprostone (178 +/- 40 nm). in patch-clamp recordings, unoprostone could be shown to double the amplitude of outward current (htm: 200% +/- 33%; n = 6; btm: 179% +/- 20%; n = 8). this effect was blocked by the specific inhibitor of maxi-k channels, iberiotoxin. conclusions: this study presents evidence for direct interaction of unoprostone with the contractility of the tm and cm. this compound may lower iop by affecting aqueous outflow, most probably conventional outflow pathways (i.e., tm) through inhibition of et-dependent mechanisms. in addition, unoprostone interacts with the maxi-k channel. although primarily ca(2+)-sensitive signal-transduction pathways seem to be involved, effects of unoprostone on ca(2+)-independent pathways and uveoscleral outflow cannot be excluded.', ""inhibition of protein kinase c (pkc) and rho-kinase (rock) may represent a new way of influencing outflow facility through isolated relaxation of the trabecular meshwork (tm). this work was performed to investigate the existence of calcium-independent contraction in this smooth-muscle-like tissue and its modulation by targeting the rho-guanosine triphosphatase (gtpase)-mediated pathway. methods: isometric tension measurements of bovine tm and ciliary muscle (cm) were performed. intra- and extracellular calcium buffering was accomplished with egta and 1, 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-n,n:,n:,n:',n:'-tetra-acetic acid tetrakis/acetoxymethhyl ester (bapta-am) followed by stimulation of pkc with phorbolester (pma) or 4alpha-phorbol. calcium-independent contraction was blocked using the highly specific rock inhibitor y-27632. western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation was performed using human tm cells. results: in tm, carbachol induced partial contraction under conditions of extracellular calcium depletion (22. 1% +/- 2.3% versus 100%, n = 9). the membrane-permeable calcium chelator bapta-am completely blocked this response (1.1% +/- 1.4% versus 100%, n = 9). when calcium was completely blocked, pma induced contraction in tm (16.7% +/- 5.9% versus 100%, n = 9) but not in cm (1.8% +/- 2.5% versus 100%, n = 6). the inactive pma analogue 4alpha-phorbol did not induce contraction, indicating that activation of pkc is involved in this contractile response. the rock inhibitor y-27632 completely blocked the calcium-independent pma-induced contraction in tm. western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation revealed the expression of the rho-a protein in human tm cells. conclusions: the data indicate that contrary to cm, the tm features calcium-independent contractile mechanisms linked to rho-a and pkc isoforms that do not require calcium for activation. rock inhibitors may allow specific modulation of the tm to enhance outflow facility, thus lowering intraocular pressure.""]"
