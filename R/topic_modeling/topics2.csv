2) specific anthropometric parameters of the muscle; and 3) fatigue parameters which were obtained from our previously recorded experimental data. the model was formulated to allow prediction of the quadriceps muscle force under dynamic activation and at various levels of stimulation. the model solution was for isometric contraction in supermaximal stimulation, and it provided the force decaying profiles, which were compared to those obtained experimentally. the parameters yielding the best fit between the model and the experimental results were indicated. particularly, two muscle nonspecific parameters, namely, the muscle stress parameter and the parameter representing the ratio between the muscle's slack length and its length in vivo at various knee angles, were determined using the model. the muscle stress parameter was found to be between 60 and 64 n/cm2, and the length ratio was 0.952, 0.935, 0.920, and 0.901 for the 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees knee angle, respectively. finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted of the model to perturbations of these two estimated parameters, revealing that the model was sensitive to these parameters."", 'resistance training (rt) is an intervention frequently used to improve muscle strength and morphology in old age. however, evidence-based, dose-response relationships regarding specific rt variables (e.g., training period, frequency, intensity, volume) are unclear in healthy old adults. the aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to determine the general effects of rt on measures of muscle strength and morphology and to provide dose-response relationships of rt variables through an analysis of randomized controlled trials (rcts) that could improve muscle strength and morphology in healthy old adults. data sources: a computerized, systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases pubmed, web of science, and the cochrane library from january 1984 up to june 2015 to identify all rcts related to rt in healthy old adults. study eligibility criteria: the initial search identified 506 studies, with a final yield of 25 studies. only rcts that examined the effects of rt in adults with a mean age of 65 and older were included. the 25 studies quantified at least one measure of muscle strength or morphology and sufficiently described training variables (e.g., training period, frequency, volume, intensity). study appraisal and synthesis methods: we quantified the overall effects of rt on measures of muscle strength and morphology by computing weighted between-subject standardized mean differences (smdbs) between intervention and control groups. we analyzed the data for the main outcomes of one-repetition maximum (1rm), maximum voluntary contraction under isometric conditions (mvc), and muscle morphology (i.e., cross-sectional area or volume or thickness of muscles) and assessed the methodological study quality by physiotherapy evidence database (pedro) scale. heterogeneity between studies was assessed using i2 and χ2 statistics. a random effects meta-regression was calculated to explain the influence of key training variables on the effectiveness of rt in terms of muscle strength and morphology. for meta-regression, training variables were divided into the following subcategories: volume, intensity, and rest. in addition to meta-regression, dose-response relationships were calculated independently for single training variables (e.g., training frequency). results: rt improved muscle strength substantially (mean smdbs = 1.57; 25 studies), but had small effects on measures of muscle morphology (mean smdbs = 0.42; nine studies). specifically, rt produced large effects in both 1rm of upper (mean smdbs = 1.61; 11 studies) and lower (mean smdbs = 1.76; 19 studies) extremities and a medium effect in mvc of lower (mean smdbs = 0.76; four studies) extremities. results of the meta-regression revealed that the variables ""training period"" (p = 0.04) and ""intensity"" (p < 0.01) as well as ""total time under tension"" (p < 0.01) had significant effects on muscle strength, with the largest effect sizes for the longest training periods (mean smdbs = 2.34; 50-53 weeks), intensities of 70-79% of the 1rm (mean smdbs = 1.89), and total time under tension of 6.0 s (mean smdbs = 3.61). a tendency towards significance was found for rest in between sets (p = 0.06), with 60 s showing the largest effect on muscle strength (mean smdbs = 4.68; two studies). we also determined the independent effects of the remaining training variables on muscle strength. the following independently computed training variables are most effective in improving measures of muscle strength: a training frequency of two sessions per week (mean smdbs = 2.13), a training volume of two to three sets per exercise (mean smdbs = 2.99), seven to nine repetitions per set (mean smdbs = 1.98), and a rest of 4.0 s between repetitions (smdbs = 3.72). with regard to measures of muscle morphology, the small number of identified studies allowed us to calculate meta-regression for the subcategory training volume only. no single training volume variable significantly predicted rt effects on measures of muscle morphology. additional training variables were independently computed to detect the largest effect for the single training variable. a training period of 50-53 weeks, a training frequency of three sessions per week, a training volume of two to three sets per exercise, seven to nine repetitions per set, a training intensity from 51 to 69% of the 1rm, a total time under tension of 6.0 s, a rest of 120 s between sets, and a rest of 2.5 s between repetitions turned out to be most effective. limitations: the current results must be interpreted with caution because of the poor overall methodological study quality (mean pedro score 4.6 points) and the considerable large heterogeneity (i2) = 80%, χ2 = 163.1, df = 32, p < 0.01) for muscle strength. in terms of muscle morphology, our search identified nine studies only, which is why we consider our findings preliminary. while we were able to determine a dose-response relationship based on specific individual training variables with respect to muscle strength and morphology, it was not possible to ascertain any potential interactions between these variables. we recognize the limitation that the results may not represent one general dose-response relationship. conclusions: this systematic literature review and meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of rt on specific measures of upper and lower extremity muscle strength and muscle morphology in healthy old adults. in addition, we were able to extract dose-response relationships for key training variables (i.e., volume, intensity, rest), informing clinicians and practitioners to design effective rts for muscle strength and morphology. training period, intensity, time under tension, and rest in between sets play an important role in improving muscle strength and morphology and should be implemented in exercise training programs targeting healthy old adults. still, further research is needed to reveal optimal dose-response relationships following rt in healthy as well as mobility limited and/or frail old adults.']"

headache frequency <5.5 days/week; bodily pain <47 and vitality <47.5. results: the ancova revealed that subjects in group 1 (positive rule, n = 89) exhibited longer headache history, shorter headache duration, lower headache frequency, higher widespread pressure hyperalgesia, higher anxiety trait levels, and lower quality of life (all, p < 0.01) than those subjects within group 2 (negative rule, n = 108). differences were similar between men and women. conclusions: this study identified a subgroup of patients with tth with higher sensitization, higher chronicity of headaches and worse quality of life but lower frequency and duration of headache episodes. this subgroup of individuals with tth may need particular attention and specific therapeutic programs for avoiding potential chronification.', 'the aim of the present review was to critically evaluate the documented evidence regarding the efficacy of biofeedback for the two most prevalent headache conditions--migraine and tension-type headache. drawing upon two recently published meta-analyses, data from 150 outcome studies, including randomized controlled trials as well as uncontrolled quasi-experimental designs, were screened. of these, 94 studies were selected for inclusion according to predefined criteria. meta-analytic integrations were carried out separately for the two conditions of interest. the main results were medium-to-large mean effect sizes for biofeedback in adult migraine and tension-type headache patients. treatment effects remained stable over an average follow-up period of 14 months, both in completer and intention-to-treat analyses. headache frequency was the primary outcome variable and showed the largest improvements. further significant effects were shown for perceived self-efficacy, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and medication consumption. reduced muscle tension in pain related areas was observed in electromyographic feedback for tension-type headache. biofeedback was more effective than waiting list and headache monitoring conditions in all cases, while electromyographic feedback for tension-type headache showed additional significant effects over placebo and relaxation therapies. levels of efficacy (migraine: efficacious, level 4; tension-type headache: efficacious and specific, level 5) and recommendations for future research are provided.', 'nociceptive mechanisms in tension-type headache are poorly understood. the aim was to investigate the pain sensitivity of pericranial muscles and a limb muscle in patients with tension-type headache. experimental muscle pain was induced by standardized infusions of 0.5 ml of 1 m hypertonic saline into two craniofacial muscles (anterior temporalis (tpa) and masseter (mas)) and a limb muscle (anterior tibial (ta)) in 24 frequent episodic tension-type headache patients (fetth), 22 chronic tension-type headache patients (ctth) and 26 age and gender matched healthy subjects. headache patients were examined twice, both on days with and on days without headache. the pressure pain thresholds (ppts) were determined before and after infusions. the subjects continuously reported intensity of saline-induced pain on an electronic visual analogue scale (vas) and the perceived area of pain was drawn on anatomical maps. headache patients demonstrated significantly lower ppts, higher saline-evoked vas pain scores and greater pain areas than healthy subjects at all the tested muscle sites (p<0.05). there was a significant gender difference for the ppts in all three groups of participants (p<0.05) and for vas pain scores in the ctth patients (p<0.05). there was no difference in pain sensitivity between fetth and ctth or between patients with or without headache. in conclusion, the present study demonstrates the presence of generalized pain hypersensitivity both in fetth and ctth compared to controls which is unrelated to actual headache status and extends to include responses to longer-lasting stimuli which are clinically highly relevant. gender differences in deep pain sensitivity seem to be a consistent finding both in healthy controls and patients with tension-type headache.']"

penile smooth musculature during normal erectile responses. the cyclic amp (camp) signaling pathway is also involved in the adjustment of smooth muscle contractility, and suggestions for interactions between cgmp- and camp-mediated mechanisms have been presented. using activators of the cgmp- or the camp-pathway, as well as inhibitors of protein kinase a (pka; camp-dependent kinase) and protein kinase g (pkg; cgmp-dependent kinase), the present study was undertaken to further delineate the functional relation between these pathways in the penis. in addition, the distribution of pka and some camp-binding phosphodiesterases (camp-pdes) were investigated in human erectile tissue. functional experiments were performed on isolated human corpus cavernosum (hcc). the effects of an inhibitor of the pka, rp-8cpt-camps (10 microm), or the pkg, rp-8-pcpt-cgmps (10 microm), on relaxation induced by the cumulative administration of sodium nitroprusside (snp), forskolin, sildenafil or tadalafil (ic351) were studied in preparations of hcc precontracted with 1 microm norepinephrine (ne). using immunohistochemical procedures, the presence of immunoreactivity for camp-pdes pde3, pde4, and pde4a, as well as for pka was investigated in specimens of hcc from which preparations were also used in the functional experiments. forskolin, snp, sildenafil, and ic 351 dose-dependently reversed ne-induced tension of isolated hcc preparations. the relaxing effects of snp were significantly attenuated by rp-8-pcpt-cgmps, but not by rp-8cpt-camps. in contrast, relaxation induced by forskolin, sildenafil and tadalafil were significantly reversed by both rp-8-pcpt-cgmps and rp-8cpt-camps. abundant immunoreactivity for pde3 and pka was observed in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells. immunoreactivity for pde4 was also detected in the smooth musculature and in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining the cavernous sinusoids, as well as in nerve fibres interspersing the trabecular stroma. the present results support the hypothesis of interactions between cgmp- and camp-mediated signals in the hcc, and suggest that the effects of inhibitors of pde5 on isolated erectile tissue may also partly or indirectly include actions of the camp second messenger system. the exact mechanism by which such an interaction occurs is not clear, but it may involve altered activity of the cgmp-inhibited pde3 brought about by a change in the intracellular levels of cgmp by the inhibition of pde5. this will in turn lead to increasing levels of camp, facilitating the interaction of camp with the pka. the immunoreactivity specific for pde3, pde4, pde4a and pka registered in hcc section is also in support of an important role for the camp/pka-system for penile smooth muscle function.', 'results from basic research implicate a role for bioactive peptides in controlling the mammalian lower urinary tract. although various peptides are assumed to be involved in the potentiaton or inhibition of cholinergic or purinergic activity in the urinary bladder, there is still much controversy regarding the mode of action and functional significance of such peptides in detrusor smooth muscle. thus, we evaluated the functional effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (anp), calcitonin gene related peptide (cgrp), endothelin 1 (et-1), substance p (sp) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip) on isolated strip preparations of human detrusor smooth muscle and determined the presence of those peptides in the human detrusor by means of immunohistochemistry. the effects of peptides on isometric tension of isolated detrusor strip preparations and on tissue levels of cyclic nucleotides camp and cgmp were compared to those of adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (f), nitric oxide donor na(+)-nitroprusside (snp) and non-specific phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitor papaverine (p). the effects of the compounds on isometric tension of isolated human detrusor smooth muscle were examined using the organ bath technique. to determine time- and dose-dependent effects on cyclic nucleotide levels, bladder strips were exposed to increasing doses of f, snp, p, anp, cgrp and vip, then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenised in the frozen state. camp and cgmp were extracted and assayed using specific radioimmunoassays. the presence of peptides was investigated by light microscopy using the avidin-biotin-complex (abc) method. f, p and vip most effectively reversed the carbachol-induced tension of isolated human detrusor strips. relaxing effects of anp, cgrp and snp were negligible. in contrast, et-1 and sp elicited dose-dependent contractions of the tissue. the relaxing effects of f, p and vip were accompanied by an increase in camp and cgmp levels, respectively. light microscopy revealed positive immunostaining for cgrp, et 1, vip and sp in sections of the detrusor muscle coat. our results suggest a possible importance of et 1, sp and vip in regulating detrusor smooth muscle contraction and relaxation. even if a peptide is not synthesised, stored or released in a smooth muscle tissue and is, therefore, unable to reach its target cells under physiologic conditions, a functional effect on the tissue might be mediated by peptide-binding to specific cell surface receptors.', 'it has been well established that male erectile dysfunction is frequently associated with vascular diseases. the normal function of cavernous arteries is considered a prerequisite to maintain sufficient blood flow to the trabecular spaces in order to enable penile erection. contractility of cavernous arteries is regulated by the peripheral autonomic nervous system and endogenous factors released from the endothelial cell layer. a significant increase of blood flow in the central cavernous arteries is the initial event leading to penile tumescence and rigidity. besides the significance of the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp)-mediated mechanisms, the cyclic amp (camp) signalling pathway is also involved in the regulation of tone of the erectile tissue, and interactions between cgmp- and camp-mediated mechanisms have been demonstrated. the aim of the present study was to investigate by means of immunohistochemistry the presence of the phosphodiesterase (pde) isoenzymes 3, 4 (camp-specific pdes) and 5 (cgmp-specific pde) in thin sections of human central cavernous arteries (hca) and their functional significance in the mechanism of vessel tone regulation. methods: functional experiments were performed using circular segments of hca and strip preparations of the human corpus cavernosum (hcc). relaxant effects induced by the cumulative addition of the pde inhibitors milrinone (pde3 inhibitor), rolipram (pde4 inhibitor) and sildenafil (pde5 inhibitor; 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 m) were studied in preparations of hca and hcc challenged by 1 m norepinephrine (ne). moreover, immunohistochemistry was carried out in order to evaluate the expression of pde3, pde4 and pde5 in thin sections of hca. results: milrinone, rolipram and sildenafil dose-dependently reversed the ne-induced tension of the isolated vascular segments and hcc strips with sildenafil being the most effective drug. neither rolipram nor milrinone reached an ec50 value. abundant immunoreactivities specific for pde3, pde4 and pde5 were observed in the entire smooth musculature of the wall of hca and resistance arteries. in addition, immunoreactivity for pde4 was also detected in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells lining the cavernous arteries. conclusions: the cgmp-dependent relaxation of cavernous arteries is not only dependent on the normal function of the peripheral autonomic nervous system but also on the functional integrity of the vascular endothelium. the expression of the cgmp-specific pde5 and the ability of the pde5 inhibitor sildenafil to reverse the adrenergic tension of isolated segments of hca underline the important role of the no/cgmp pathway in the control of smooth muscle tone of human trabecular smooth musculature and penile cavernous arteries. our results also suggest a significance of the camp-dependent signaling mechanisms in the regulation of tension of central hcas. the present findings are also in support of the hypothesis of interactions between the cgmp- and camp-mediated signaling pathways in hcas. further investigations are indicated in order to outline potential differences between central hcas and helicine resistance arteries. this may help to understand better the relations between structural and functional changes in the penile erectile tissue in patients with cardiovascular diseases and endothelial dysfunction.']"

evaluated before and after 8 wk of maximal effort stretch-shortening cycle (ssc) exercise training. muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of eight men before and after the training period. fibers were evaluated regarding their mechanical properties and subsequently classified according to their myosin heavy chain content (sds-page). after training, maximal leg extensor muscle force and vertical jump performance were improved 12% (p<0.01) and 13% (p<0.001), respectively. single-fiber cross-sectional area increased 23% in type i (p<0.01), 22% in type iia (p<0.001), and 30% in type iia/iix fibers (p<0.001). peak force increased 19% in type i (p<0.01), 15% in type iia (p<0.001), and 16% in type iia/iix fibers (p<0.001). when peak force was normalized with cross-sectional area, no changes were found for any fiber type. maximal shortening velocity was increased 18, 29, and 22% in type i, iia, and hybrid iia/iix fibers, respectively (p<0.001). peak power was enhanced in all fiber types, and normalized peak power improved 9% in type iia fibers (p<0.05). fiber tension on passive stretch increased in iia/iix fibers only (p<0.05). in conclusion, short-term ssc exercise training enhanced single-fiber contraction performance via force and contraction velocity in type i, iia, and iia/iix fibers. these results suggest that ssc exercises are an effective training approach to improve fiber force, contraction velocity, and therefore power.', 'biopsy samples were taken from the vastus lateralis of 18- to 84-yr-old male sprinters (n = 91). fiber-type distribution, cross-sectional area, and myosin heavy chain (mhc) isoform content were identified using atpase histochemistry and sds-page. specific tension and maximum shortening velocity (v(o)) were determined in 144 single skinned fibers from younger (18-33 yr, n = 8) and older (53-77 yr, n = 9) runners. force-time characteristics of the knee extensors were determined by using isometric contraction. the cross-sectional area of type i fibers was unchanged with age, whereas that of type ii fibers was reduced (p < 0.001). with age there was an increased mhc i (p < 0.01) and reduced mhc iix isoform content (p < 0.05) but no differences in mhc iia. specific tension of type i and iia mhc fibers did not differ between younger and older subjects. v(o) of fibers expressing type i mhc was lower (p < 0.05) in older than in younger subjects, but there was no difference in v(o) of type iia mhc fibers. an aging-related decline of maximal isometric force (p < 0.001) and normalized rate of force development (p < 0.05) of knee extensors was observed. normalized rate of force development was positively associated with mhc ii (p < 0.05). the sprint-trained athletes experienced the typical aging-related reduction in the size of fast fibers, a shift toward a slower mhc isoform profile, and a lower v(o) of type i mhc fibers, which played a role in the decline in explosive force production. however, the muscle characteristics were preserved at a high level in the oldest runners, underlining the favorable impact of sprint exercise on aging muscle.', 'based on the mhc isoform pattern, adult mammalian limb skeletal muscles contain two and, in some species, three types of fast fibers (type iia, iix, and iib), and one slow fiber (type i). slow muscles, such as the soleus, contain primarily the slow type i fiber, whereas fast-twitch muscles are composed primarily of a mixture of the fast myosin isozymes. force generation involves cross-bridge interaction and transition from a weakly bound, low-force state (am-adp-p(i)) to the strongly bound, high-force state (am-adp). this transition is thought to be rate limiting in terms of dp/dt, and the high-force state is the dominant cross-bridge form during a peak isometric contraction. intact fast and slow skeletal muscles generate approximately the same amount of peak force (po) of between 200 and 250 kn.m-2. however, the rate of transition from the low- to high-force state shows ca2+ sensitivity and is 7-fold higher in fast-twitch, as compared to slow-twitch, skeletal muscle fibers. fiber vo or the maximal cross-bridge cycle rate is highly correlated with and thought to be dependent on the specific activity of the myosin or myofibrillar atpase. the hierarchy for vo is the type iib > iix > iia > i. this functional difference for the fast fiber types explains the higher vo observed in the predominantly type iib svl vs. the mixed fast type iia and iib edl muscle. a plot of vo vs. species size demonstrates that an inverse relationship exists between vo and body mass. from the standpoint of work capacity, the important property is power output. an analysis of individual muscles indicates that peak power is obtained at loads considerably below 50% of po. individuals with a high percentage of fast-twitch fibers generate a greater torque and higher power at a given velocity than those with predominantly slow-twitch fibers. in humans, mean peak power occurred in a ratio of 10:5:1 for the type iib, iia, and i fibers. the in vivo measurement of the torque-velocity relationship and vmax in human muscle is difficult because of limitations inherent in the equipment used and the inability to study the large limb muscles independently. nevertheless, the in vivo torque-velocity relationships are similar to those measured in vitro in animals. this observation suggests that little central nervous system inhibition exists and that healthy subjects are able to achieve maximal activation of their muscles. although peak isometric tension is not dependent on fiber type distribution, a positive correlation exists between the percentage of fast fibers and peak torque output at moderate-to-high angular isokinetic velocities. consequently, peak power output is substantially greater in subjects possessing a predominance of fast fibers. the mechanical properties of slow and fast muscles do adapt to programs of regular exercise. endurance exercise training has been shown to increase the vo of the slow soleus by 20%. this increase could have been caused by either a small increase in all, or most, of the fibers, or to a conversion of a few fibers from slow to fast. recently, the increase was shown to be caused by the former, as the individual slow type i fibers of the soleus showed a 20% increase in vo, but there was little or no change in the percentage of fast fibers. the increased vo was correlated with, and likely caused by, an increased fiber atpase. we hypothesize that the increased atpase and cross-bridge cycling speed might be attributable to an increased expression of fast mlcs in the slow type i fibers (fig. 14.10). this hypothesis is based on the fact that light chains have been shown to be involved in the power stroke, and removal of light chains depresses force and velocity. regular endurance exercise training had no effect on fiber size, but with prolonged durations of daily training it depressed po and peak power. when the training is maintained over prolonged periods, it may even induce atrophy of the slow type i and fast type iia fibers.

isometric tension was recorded. the blood vessels were contracted with et-1 or norepinephrine and relaxations to prostacyclin or sodium nitroprusside were studied. mammary veins exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to et-1 (10(-11) to 3 x 10(-7) m) as compared to the artery and saphenous vein (log shift at ed50: 32- and 79-fold, respectively; p less than 0.005). in saphenous veins maximally contracted with et-1, relaxations to prostacyclin were blunted as compared to the artery (p less than 0.005; n = 5). similarly, et-1 inhibited relaxations to sodium nitroprusside in the vein, but not in the artery. in contrast, venous rings contracted with norepinephrine were more sensitive to sodium nitroprusside than the artery. thus, the human mammary vein, but not the saphenous vein, is more sensitive to the vasoconstrictor effects of et-1 when compared to the mammary artery. in veins, et-1 but not norepinephrine inhibits the vascular effects of prostacyclin and sodium nitroprusside, suggesting a specific interaction of the peptide with camp- and cgmp-dependent relaxation.']"

'were', 'or']","['Muscle Activity and EMG', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']","[""the detection of the electrical signal from human and animal muscle dates from long before l. galvani who took credit for it. j. swammerdam had already shown the duke of tuscany in 1658 the mechanics of muscular contraction. even if 'electrology or localised electrisation' - the original terminology for electromyography (emg) - contained the oldest biological scientific detection and measuring techniques, emg remained a 'supporting' measurement with limited discriminating use, except in conjunction with other methods. all this changed when emg became a diagnostic tool for studies of muscle weakness, fatigue, pareses, paralysis. and nerve conduction velocities, lesions of the motor unit or for neurogenic and myogenic problems. in addition to the measurement qualities, the electrical signal could be induced as functional electrical stimulation (fes), which developed as a specific rehabilitation tool. almost in parallel and within the expanding area of emg, a speciality developed wherein the aim was to use emg for the study of muscular function and coordination of muscles in different movements and postures. kinesiological emg and therewith surface emg can be applied in studies of normal muscle function during selected movements and postures; muscle activity in complex sports; occupational and rehabilitation movements; isometric contraction with increasing tension up to the maximal voluntary contraction, evaluation of functional anatomical muscle activity (validation of classical anatomical functions); coordination and synchronization studies (kinematic chain); specificity and efficiency of training methods; fatigue; the relationship between emg and force; the human-machine interaction; the influence of material on muscle activity, occupational loading in relation to lower back pain and joint kinematics. within these various applications the recording system (e.g. the signal detection, the volume conduction, signal amplification, impedance and frequency responses, the signal characteristics) and the data-processing system (e.g. rectification, linear envelope and normalization methods) go hand in hand with a critical appraisal of choices, limits and possibilities."", ""electromyography (emg) and normalized emg have been accepted as methods of quantifying the activity level of a muscle. normalized emg, in conjunction with the emg/force relationship and muscle cross-sectional area data, allows researchers to estimate the amount of muscle force exerted across a joint. an accurate description of this muscle force is a critical input to models designed to describe the risk of injury of a task. in order to be able to make statements about the relative intensity of an emg signal, researchers who use normalization procedures take a given emg activity level, at a known joint angle, and relate it to some reference activity level obtained at that particular joint angle. however, there have been studies where the emg activity of an unrestricted dynamic task, such as walking, cycling, performing an occupational task, etc., has been normalized with respect to an emg value taken during a single maximum voluntary contraction performed at one reference joint angle. this practice will render inaccurate results because at different joint angles there are changes in the portion of the muscle within the viewing area of the electrode, as well as changes in the length/tension relationship of the muscle which would cause changes in the maximum emg value. the present study was an attempt to quantify the errors associated with normalization relative to a reference emg value collected at an arbitrary joint position. four subjects performed a series of controlled trunk extension exertions. as they performed these exertions the emg activities were collected for eight trunk muscles. the task emg values that resulted were then: (1) all normalized with respect to the maximum emg at a single arbitrary trunk angle and (2) each normalized with respect to that specific trunk angle's maximum emg. the results show that for the primary trunk extensors (erector spinae) large errors (greater than 75%) resulted from normalization using a single reference point and the magnitude of these errors followed consistent patterns within subjects as a function of trunk angle."", 'it is generally accepted that neural factors play an important role in muscle strength gains. this article reviews the neural adaptations in strength, with the goal of laying the foundations for practical applications in sports medicine and rehabilitation. an increase in muscular strength without noticeable hypertrophy is the first line of evidence for neural involvement in acquisition of muscular strength. the use of surface electromyographic (semg) techniques reveal that strength gains in the early phase of a training regimen are associated with an increase in the amplitude of semg activity. this has been interpreted as an increase in neural drive, which denotes the magnitude of efferent neural output from the cns to active muscle fibres. however, semg activity is a global measure of muscle activity. underlying alterations in semg activity are changes in motor unit firing patterns as measured by indwelling (wire or needle) electrodes. some studies have reported a transient increase in motor unit firing rate. training-related increases in the rate of tension development have also been linked with an increased probability of doublet firing in individual motor units. a doublet is a very short interspike interval in a motor unit train, and usually occurs at the onset of a muscular contraction. motor unit synchronisation is another possible mechanism for increases in muscle strength, but has yet to be definitely demonstrated. there are several lines of evidence for central control of training-related adaptation to resistive exercise. mental practice using imagined contractions has been shown to increase the excitability of the cortical areas involved in movement and motion planning. however, training using imagined contractions is unlikely to be as effective as physical training, and it may be more applicable to rehabilitation. retention of strength gains after dissipation of physiological effects demonstrates a strong practice effect. bilateral contractions are associated with lower semg and strength compared with unilateral contractions of the same muscle group. semg magnitude is lower for eccentric contractions than for concentric contractions. however, resistive training can reverse these trends. the last line of evidence presented involves the notion that unilateral resistive exercise of a specific limb will also result in training effects in the unexercised contralateral limb (cross-transfer or cross-education). peripheral involvement in training-related strength increases is much more uncertain. changes in the sensory receptors (i.e. golgi tendon organs) may lead to disinhibition and an increased expression of muscular force. agonist muscle activity results in limb movement in the desired direction, while antagonist activity opposes that motion. both decreases and increases in co-activation of the antagonist have been demonstrated. a reduction in antagonist co-activation would allow increased expression of agonist muscle force, while an increase in antagonist co-activation is important for maintaining the integrity of the joint. thus far, it is not clear what the cns will optimise: force production or joint integrity. the following recommendations are made by the authors based on the existing literature. motor learning theory and imagined contractions should be incorporated into strength-training practice. static contractions at greater muscle lengths will transfer across more joint angles. submaximal eccentric contractions should be used when there are issues of muscle pain, detraining or limb immobilisation. the reversal of antagonists (antagonist-to-agonist) proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation contraction pattern would be useful to increase the rate of tension development in older adults, thus serving as an important prophylactic in preventing falls. when evaluating the neural changes induced by strength training using emg recording, antagonist emg activity should always be measured and evaluated.']"

p < 0.01). both adult groups had greater values than the children (p < 0.01) but there were no differences between boys (5.2 kn, 99 cm(2)) and girls (6.1 kn, 102 cm(2)). agonist activation was greater in men and women than in girls (p < 0.05), and antagonist activation was greater in men than in boys (p < 0.05). moment arm length was greater in men than in boys or girls and greater in women than in boys (p < 0.05). the angle of pennation did not differ between the groups in any of the quadriceps heads. the specific tension was similar (p > 0.05) between groups: men, 55 +/- 11 n cm(-2); women, 57.3 +/- 13 n cm(-2); boys, 54 +/- 14 n cm(-2); and girls, 59.8 +/- 15 n cm(-2). these findings indicate that the increased muscle strength with maturation is not due to an increase in the specific tension of muscle;

however, hela cells with nonoriented f-actin with smaller fas did not. the internal force of the actin fibers was significantly higher in vsmcs than that in hela cells, and the increase or decrease in the cytoskeletal forces improved or diminished the sensing ability for shallow grooves, respectively. the results strongly indicated that directional cell migration should be modulated by cell type-specific cytoskeletal arrangements and intracellular traction forces. the differences in cell type-specific orientation and migration responses can be emphasized on the microgrooves as large as the horizontal and vertical size of fas. conclusion: the microgoove structure in the size range of the fa protein complex is a powerful tool to clarify subtle differences in the intracellular force-dependent substrate mechanosensing.', 'vascular endothelial cells that are cultured on layers of gelled basement membrane matrix organize rapidly into networks of cords or tubelike structures. although this phenomenon is a potential model for angiogenesis in vivo, we questioned whether basement membrane matrix directs the differentiation of endothelial cells in a specific manner. in this study, we have examined factors that influence the formation of cellular networks in vitro in an attempt to define a basic mechanism for this process. we found that endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and cells of the murine leydig cell line tm3 formed networks on basement membrane matrix in much the same fashion. light and electron microscopy, combined with time-lapse videomicroscopy, revealed that cells organized on a tesselated network of aligned basement membrane matrix that was generated by tension forces of cellular traction. cellular elongation and progressive motility across the surface of the gel were restricted to tracks of aligned matrix and did not occur until the tracks appeared. the formation of cellular networks on basement membrane matrix was inhibited by reducing the thickness of the matrix, by including native type i collagen in the matrix, or by disrupting cytoskeletal microfilaments and microtubules. cell division was not required for network formation. bovine aortic endothelial cells that formed networks did not simultaneously transcribe mrna for type i collagen, a protein synthesized by endothelial cells that form tubes spontaneously in vitro. moreover, levels of mrna for fibronectin and sparc (secreted protein that is acidic and rich in cysteine) in network-forming cells were similar to levels seen in endothelial cells that did not form networks. endothelial cells and tm3 cells that were plated on highly malleable gels of native type i collagen also formed cords and aligned matrix fibers into linear tracks that resembled those generated on basement membrane matrix, although the structures were not as well-defined. our observations suggest that the mechanochemical properties of extracellular matrices are able to translate the forces of cellular traction into templates that direct the formation of complex cellular patterns.']"

dilation. these physiological responses reflect the need to improve gas exchange in the lung, and to enhance the delivery of blood to hypoxic systemic tissues. an important unresolved question relates to the underlying mechanism by which the vascular cells detect a decrease in oxygen tension and translate that into a signal that triggers the functional response. a growing body of work implicates the mitochondria, which appear to function as o2 sensors by initiating a redox-signaling pathway that leads to the activation of downstream effectors that regulate vascular tone. however, the direction of this redox signal has been the subject of controversy. part of the problem has been the lack of appropriate tools to assess redox signaling in live cells. recent advancements in the development of redox sensors have led to studies that help to clarify the nature of the hypoxia-induced redox signaling by reactive oxygen species (ros). moreover, these studies provide valuable insight regarding the basis for discrepancies in earlier studies of the hypoxia-induced mechanism of redox signaling. based on recent work, it appears that the o2 sensing mechanism in both the pa and sa are identical, that mitochondria function as the site of o2 sensing, and that increased ros release from these organelles leads to the activation of cell-specific, downstream vascular responses.', 'in lung vasculature, reversible constriction of smooth muscle cells exists in response to acute decrease in oxygen levels (hypoxia). progressive and irreversible structural remodeling that reduces blood vessel lumen takes place in response to chronic hypoxia and results in pulmonary hypertension. several studies have shown a role of serotonin in regulating acute and chronic hypoxic responses. in this review the contribution of serotonin, its receptors and transporter in lung hypoxic responses is discussed. hypoxic conditions modify plasma levels of serotonin, serotonin transporter activity, and expression of 5-ht1b and 5-ht2b receptors. these appear to be required for pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, which depends on the ratio between reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. a heterozygous mutation was identified in the 5-ht2b receptor gene of a patient who developed pulmonary hypertension after fenfluramines anorexigen treatment. this c-terminus truncated 5-ht2b mutant receptor presents lower nitric oxide coupling, and higher cell proliferation capacity than the wild-type receptor. under low oxygen tension, cells increase the transcription of specific genes via stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (hif)-1. factors such as angiotensin ii or thrombin that can also control hif-1 pathway contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling. the 5-ht2b receptor via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/akt activates nuclear factor-kappab, which is involved in the regulation of hif-1 expression. acontrol of hif- 1 by 5-ht2b receptors explains why expression of pulmonary vascular remodeling factors, such as endothelin-1 or transforming growth factor-beta, which is hif-1-alpha regulated, is not modified in hypoxic 5-ht2b receptor mutant mice. understanding the detailed mechanisms involved in lung hypoxic responses may provide general insight into pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis.', '1. changes in the environmental oxygen tension to which cells are exposed in vivo result in physiological and sometimes pathological consequences that are associated with differential expression of specific genes. 2. low oxygen tension (hypoxia) affects endothelial cellular physiology in vivo and in vitro in a number of ways, including the transcriptionally regulated expression of vasoactive substances and matrix proteins involved in modulating vascular tone or remodelling the vasculature and surrounding tissue. 3. hypoxia results in the transcriptional induction of genes encoding vasoconstrictors and smooth muscle mitogens (pdgf-b, endothelin-1, vegf, thrombospondin-1) and genes encoding matrix or remodelling molecules (collagenase iv (mmp-9), thrombospondin-1) and reciprocal transcriptional inhibition of vasodilatory or anti-mitogenic effectors (enos). 4. oxygen appears to signal through a novel haem-containing sensor and signals initiated by this sensor alter the levels and dna-binding activity of transcription factors such as activating protein (ap)-1, nuclear factor-kappa b and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1. 5. the genes encoding vasoactive factors regulated by oxygen tension are themselves also regulated by the vasoactive agent nitric oxide (no). 6. nitric oxide and oxygen transduce similar signals (i.e. their absence results in identical patterns of gene expression in endothelial cells and other cell types). 7. thus, no can feedback on and modulate signals induced by hypoxia and vice versa. for example, no, which can act directly on smooth muscle cells as a vasodilator, can also facilitate vasodilation indirectly by reversing the production of vasoconstrictors induced by hypoxia. 8. short-term exposure of endothelial cells to low oxygen tension results in the elaboration of predominantly vasoconstricting effectors, while longer-term and more severe hypoxic exposure generates factors that can induce smooth muscle proliferation and remodelling. 9. thus, the endothelial cell response to hypoxic stress can result in two different consequences in the surrounding tissues, depending on the duration of the exposure: short-term exposure causes physiological and reversible modulation of vascular tone and blood flow; chronic hypoxic stress results in irreversible remodelling of the vasculature and surrounding tissues, with smooth muscle proliferation and fibrosis. 10. this dichotomy of responses to hypoxia may explain, in part, both the acute and chronic pathophysiological sequelae of diseases characterized by regional hypoxia, including atherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, sickle cell disease and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).']"

characterized by modifications of morphological, biochemical, and molecular variables that alter the functional attributes of specific skeletal muscle fiber types. skeletal muscle adaptation is diverse and the magnitude of change is dependent on many factors, such as activity pattern, age, and muscle fiber type composition. the adaptation of skeletal muscle in the adult population is well described. in contrast, the adaptation of skeletal muscle in the older population is less documented, especially in the area of inactivity-induced alterations. age-related changes in skeletal muscle may play a significant role in the magnitude of change with inactivity and influence the rehabilitation process for the older adult. a consistent feature of age and inactivity is limb muscle atrophy and the loss of peak force and power. differences exist in the rate and mechanisms of muscle wasting and in the susceptibility of a given fiber type to atrophy. most likely, the rapid muscle wasting might be in part due to a decrease in protein synthesis coupled with an increased degradation. besides the quantitative change in muscle mass, age and inactivity induce important qualitative changes in the structure of key skeletal muscle proteins that are manifested in alterations in contractile properties. therefore, the purpose of this clinical commentary is to identify the major effects of age and inactivity on skeletal muscle structure and function, and discuss potential therapeutic interventions. special emphasis will be placed on how alterations in muscle structure affect function and on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the age-related and inactivity-induced muscle changes.', 'the age-related loss of muscle mass known as senile sarcopenia is one of the main determinants of frailty in old age. molecular, cellular, nutritional and hormonal mechanisms are at the basis of sarcopenia and are responsible for a progressive deterioration in skeletal muscle size and function. both at single-fibre and at whole-muscle level, the loss of force exceeds that predicted by the decrease in muscle size. for single fibres, the loss of intrinsic force is mostly due to a loss in myofibrillar protein content. for whole muscle, in addition to changes in neural drive, alterations in muscle architecture and in tendon mechanical properties, exemplified by a reduction in tendon stiffness, have recently been shown to contribute to this phenomenon. resistance training can, however, cause substantial gains in muscle mass and strength and provides a protective effect against several of the cellular and molecular changes associated with muscle wasting and weakness. in old age, not only muscles but also tendons are highly responsive to training, since an increase in tendon stiffness has been observed after a period of increased loading. many of the myotendinous factors characterizing ageing can be at least partly reversed by resistance training.', ""senile sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass associated with aging, is one of the main causes of muscle weakness and reduced locomotor ability in old age. although this condition is mainly driven by neuropathic processes, nutritional, hormonal and immunological factors, as well as a reduction in physical activity, contribute to this phenomenon. sarcopenia alone, however, does not fully account for the observed muscle weakness, as the loss of force is greater than that accounted for by the decrease in muscle size. as a consequence, a reduction in the force per unit area, both at single fibre and at whole muscle level, is observed. we recently suggested that at whole muscle level, this reduction in intrinsic force is the result of the combined effect of changes in (1) muscle architecture, (2) tendon mechanical properties, (3) neural drive (reduced agonist and increased antagonist muscle activity) and (4) single fibre-specific tension. whereas several studies support the role of the last two factors in the loss of intrinsic muscle force with aging, alterations in muscle architecture and in tendon mechanical properties have also been shown to contribute to the above phenomenon. indeed, sarcopenia of the human plantarflexors, represented by a 25% reduction in muscle volume, was found to be associated with a 10% reduction in fibre fascicle length and 13% reduction in pennation angle. these architectural alterations were accompanied by a 10% decrease in tendon stiffness, attributable to alterations in tendon material properties, as suggested by a 14% decrease in young's modulus. most of these changes may be reversed by 14 weeks of resistive training; both fibre fascicle length and tendon stiffness were found to be increased by 10 and 64%, respectively. surprisingly, however, training had no effect on the estimated relative length-tension properties of the muscle, indicating that the effects of greater tendon stiffness and increased fascicle length cancelled out each other. it seems that natural strategies may be in place to ensure that the relative operating range of muscle remains unaltered by changes in physical activity, in old age.""]"

the position of the glenohumeral rotational centre and of the deltoid muscle length is essential to understand optimal placement of a total shoulder prosthesis. this study is designed to analyse the effect of deltoid muscle elongation on shoulder joint function. design: a three-dimensional model of the glenohumeral joint with deltoid muscle analysis in the scapular plane. methods: a geometrical three-dimensional ball-and-socket model of the shoulder joint was developed. from dry bones, the position of the origins and insertions of the three parts of the deltoid muscle relative to the calculated centre of rotation of the humeral head was defined. the position and the direction of the muscle force working lines relative to this humeral centre were calculated using former measurements and ct-data of the deltoid. muscle length-tension data were applied to obtain angle-force relationships. the model was used to calculate the angle-force relationships, the moment arm and the moment of the deltoid muscle components for successive arm elevation angles in the scapular plane. these data were compared to those of a theoretical situation assuming a 10% elongation of the muscle. results: muscle angle-force curves show a more favourable slope after moderate (10%) deltoid muscle elongation. elongating the muscle by changing the distance between the humeral rotation point and the deltoid insertion along the humeral axis does not affect moment arms. the moments of the deltoid muscle forces themselves, however, seem more adapted to elevation in the scapular plane. the deltoid maximal moment exceeds the arm-weight moment by about 40% instead of being approximately equal, and that the maximum is situated around 100 degrees of elevation. conclusions: from a biomechanical point of view, stretching the deltoid muscle by 10% seems to result in a significantly more favourable position in case of shoulder elevation at 90 degrees of abduction in the scapular plane in a centred glenohumeral joint. relevance: this model suggests that a 10% elongation of the deltoid muscle, the most important shoulder abductor, improves its ability to elevate the arm. if

unusual bilateral ureteral reimplantation due to endometriosis and to provide a flowchart of conservative decision making. design: video description of a case, demonstrating a step-by-step explanation of the decision planning and description of the surgical steps in a female patient with bilateral ureteral endometriosis who had previously undergone operation for bowel endometriosis, and who presented with extensive disease in the posterior compartment with no symptoms besides bilateral renal function disruption. the study was reviewed and approved by the hospital beneficência portuguesa de são paulo institutional review board. setting: tertiary referral center. patients: deep infiltrating endometriosis involving the ureter has an incidence of 0.1% to 1%, normally affecting the lower one-third of its segment, up to 4 cm above the vesicoureteric junction. bilateral ureteral involvement occurs in 9% of cases. the absence of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis of this condition challenging. lumbar pain develops when its involvement is complicated by marked obstruction with impaired renal function. decompressive surgery is mandatory. the necessity of ureteroneocystostomy increases along with the severity of hydronephrosis, accounting for 62% of ureteral decompressive procedures. however, bilateral ureteroneocystostomy is a rare procedure, not exceeding 6% of ureteral reimplantations. this case illustrates a situation in which a patient with a previous bowel segmental resection presented with an advanced bilateral posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis, compromising the lower rectum below the previous anastomosis, vagina, posterior, and lateral parametrium bilaterally and both inferior hypogastric plexi. hormonal therapy improved endometriosis symptoms but did not control the urinary tract involvement. along with the patient, considering a high probability of intestinal, urinary, and sexual impairment, a conservative approach was chosen. intervention: the procedure started with adesiolysis, accessing the retroperitoneum and identifying both dilated ureters (figs. 1 and 2). they were dissected as caudally as possible, until endometriosis fibrosis was reached, to have a bigger length of proximal ureter to allow a tension-free ureteroneocystostomy. the retzius space was developed, and the bladder was freed and mobilized (fig. 3). after cutting the ureter, the proximal end was spatulated. the bladder dome was approximated to the psoas muscle with an interrupted suture to permit a tension-free ureteroneocystostomy. the detrusor muscle was opened for approximately 2 to 3 cm, exposing the vesical mucosa, which was subsequently opened. the posterior ureterovesical anastomosis was performed with running monofilament absorbable 4-0 sutures. a double-j stent was placed, and the anterior ureterovesical anastomosis was completed. the detrusor muscle was loosely closed over the ureter with interrupted absorbable sutures to avoid urinary reflux. a maryland clamp was used to ensure sufficient entry of the tunnel. all these steps were repeated in the contralateral side. main outcome measure(s): successful performance of a bilateral laparoscopy tension-free ureteroneocystostomy with bilateral psoas hitch. results: the postoperative course was uneventful. renal function was restored. one year after surgery, the patient remained asymptomatic, and endometriotic lesions showed no increase, thus remaining stable. conclusion: ureteral endometriosis can be aggressive and indolent. decompressive procedures must be performed. the decision-making process must take into consideration the patient's characteristics and expectations. in selected cases, a conservative approach may be required, when future possible functional disfunctions can be worse than the actual symptoms. in those situations, close surveillance is necessary."", 'the tension-free vaginal tape (tvt) procedure has long been considered the gold standard for female stress incontinence. since its introduction in 1995, several other tapes and other minimally invasive treatments have arisen. the transobturator tape (tot) procedure reproduces the natural suspension of the urethra through the obturator and puborectalis muscles. the tot procedure was reportedly developed in an effort to prevent bladder perforation associated with the tvt and is generally considered to be a procedure with low morbidity. at our institution, we report the first case of infected mesh with subsequent myositis of adductor muscles after a tot procedure. to our knowledge, this is the first case reporting this complication, citing specifically that the anatomical structures traversed by the tape, including both muscle and fascia, can be at risk for infection and ultimately require removal of the sling material. we performed a medline literature search using key words such as ""transobturator tape,"" ""tension free vaginal tape,"" and ""adductor and obturator complications"" to ascertain any reported adductor or obturator muscle complications after placement of tot. further, we reviewed the literature to elucidate the consequences of using different mesh materials, specifically their effects on erosion. we reported our case of a 43-year-old woman who presented with right-leg cellulitis and vaginal discharge after having a tot placed for stress incontinence. inflammation of the adductor muscles was demonstrated on computed tomography (ct) scan and ultrasound. on physical exam, the mesh had visibly eroded through the vaginal wall. our patient underwent excision of the mesh material. she ultimately had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home in good condition on the postoperative day 2. the mesh material removed was obtape. we believe our study is the first case report to discuss the complication of infected adductor muscles and erosion of the tape during post-tot procedure. after a careful review of the literature, there is no mention of myositis of adductor muscles as a possible complication after the tot procedure. in fact, the literature has deemed this minimally invasive treatment as a safe and effective procedure with minimal complications including only de novo urgency or urinary retention. the site of infection is of particular interest and can be explained by the course through the anatomical structures that are unique to this particular procedure. ultimately, the treatment for this procedure was the removal of the mesh along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. in conclusion, the burden falls upon the surgeons to report in a timely fashion both successes and complication for the tot procedure given their relatively limited experience. this is paramount in determining patients\' risks.']"

to retain upright mobility capabilities. unfortunately, interaction between the residual limb and the prosthetic socket causes elevated internal strains and stresses in the muscle and fat tissues in the residual limb, which may lead to deep tissue injury (dti) and other complications. presently, there is paucity of information on the mechanical conditions in the tta residual limb during load-bearing. accordingly, our aim was to characterize the mechanical conditions in the muscle flap of the residual limb of a tta patient after donning the prosthetic socket and during load-bearing. knowledge of internal mechanical conditions in the muscle flap can be used to identify the risk for dti and improve the fitting of the prosthesis. we used a patient-specific modelling approach which involved an mri scan, interface pressure measurements between the residual limb and the socket of the prosthesis and three-dimensional non-linear large-deformation finite-element (fe) modelling to quantify internal soft tissue strains and stresses in a female tta patient during static load-bearing. movement of the truncated tibia and fibula during load-bearing was measured by means of mri and used as displacement boundary conditions for the fe model. subsequently, we calculated the internal strains, strain energy density (sed) and stresses in the muscle flap under the truncated bones. internal strains under the tibia peaked at 85%, 129% and 106% for compression, tension and shear strains, respectively. internal strains under the fibula peaked at substantially lower values, that is, 19%, 22% and 19% for compression, tension and shear strains, respectively. strain energy density peaked at the tibial end (104kj/m(3)). the von mises stresses peaked at 215kpa around the distal end of the tibia. stresses under the fibula were at least one order of magnitude lower than the stresses under the tibia. we surmise that our present patient-specific modelling method is an important tool in understanding the etiology of dti in the residual limbs of tta patients.', 'the residual limb of transtibial amputation (tta) prosthetic users is threatened daily by pressure ulcers (pu) and deep tissue injury (dti) caused mainly by sustained mechanical strains and stresses. several risk factors dominate the extent of internal tissue loads in the residuum. in this study, we developed a set of three-dimensional finite element (fe) models that were variants of a patient-specific fe model, built from magnetic resonance imaging scans. the set of fe modes was utilized to assess the impact of the following risk factors on the strain/stress distribution in the muscle flap: (i) the tibial length, (ii) the tibial bevelment, (iii) a fibular osteophyte, (iv) the mechanical properties of the muscle, and (v) scarring in different locations and depths. a total of 12 nonlinear fe model configurations, representing variations in these factors, were built and solved. we present herein calculations of compression, tension and shear strains and stresses, von mises stresses, and strain energy density averaged in critical locations in the muscle flap as well as volumes of concentration of elevated stresses in these areas. our results overall show higher stresses accumulating in the bone proximity rather than in outlying soft tissues. the longer bone configurations spread the loads toward the external surfaces of the muscle flap. when shortening the truncated bones from 11.2 to 9.2 cm, the von mises stresses at the distal edges of the bones were relieved considerably (by up to 80%), which indicates a predicted decreased risk for dti. decreasing the tibial bevelment mildly, from 52.3 degrees to 37.7 degrees caused propagation of internal stresses from the bone proximity toward the more superficial soft tissues of the residuum, thereby also theoretically reducing the risk for dti. an osteophyte at the distal fibular end increased the strain and stress distributions directly under the fibula but had little effect (<1%) on stresses at other sites, e.g., under the tibia. elevation of muscle stiffness (instantaneous shear modulus increase from 8.5 to 16.2 kpa), simulating variation between patients, and muscle flap contraction or spasm, showed the most substantial effect by an acute rise of the von mises stresses at the bone proximity. the mean von mises stresses at the bone proximity were approximately twofold higher in the contracted/spastic muscle when compared to the flaccid muscle. locating a surgical scar in different sites and depths of the residuum had the least influence on the overall loading of the muscle flap (where stresses changed by <7%). pending further validation by epidemiological pu and dti risk factor studies, the conclusions of this study can be incorporated as guidelines for tta surgeons, physical therapists, prosthetists, and the tta patients themselves to minimize the onset of pu and dti in this population. additionally, the present analyses can be used to guide or focus epidemiological research of pu and dti risk factors in the tta population.', ""divergent descriptions of the anatomic location and biomechanical function of the iliotibial tract (it) can be found in the literature. this study attempted to obtain exact data regarding the anatomic course and material characteristics including the biomechanical properties of this structure. the following were its aims: (1) anatomical investigations of the it; (2) mechanical properties of the it; (3) femoral head centralizing force of the it and subligamentous forces in the height of the greater trochanter in different joint positions by using a custom-made measuring prosthesis and a subligamentous positioned sensor; (4) construction of a finite element model of the proximal femur including the it and measuring the femoral neck angle under variation. the hip joints and it in a total of 18 unfixed corpses were evaluated. we studied the anatomic relationship to surrounding structures, as well as the material properties with the help of tensile strength testing utilizing an uniaxial apparatus. during the test, a load-displacement curve was registered, documenting the maximum load and deformation of the it. to measure the subligamentous pressure at the height of the greater trochanter, a custom-made sensor with a power-recording instrument was constructed. furthermore, an altered hip prosthesis with a pressure gauge at the height of the femoral neck was used to measure the forces which are directed at the acetabulum. the investigations were done in neutral-0 position and ab/adduction of the hip joint of the unfixed corpse. in addition, we varied the femoral neck angle between 115 degrees and 155 degrees in 5 degrees steps. to confirm the subligamentous forces, we did the same measurements intraoperatively at the height of the greater trochanter before and after hip joint replacement in 12 patients. we constructed a finite element model of the proximal femur and considering the it. the acquisition of the data was done at physiological (128 degrees), varus (115 degrees), and valgus (155 degrees) femoral neck angles. the influencing forces of the it at the height of the greater trochanter and the forces at the femoral head or the acetabulum could be measured. our anatomical investigations revealed a splitting of the it into a superficial and a deep portion, which covers the tensor fasciae latae. the tensor fasciae latae has an insertion on the it. the it continues down the femur, passing over the greater trochanter without developing an actual fixation to the bone. part of the insertion of the gluteus maximus radiates into the it. the it passes over the vastus lateralis and inserts at the infracondylar tubercle of the tibia or gerdy's tubercle, at the head of the fibula, as well as at the lateral intermuscular septum. portions also insert on the transverse and longitudinal retinaculum of the patella. concerning the material properties of the it, we found a structural stiffness of 17 n/mm extension on average (d = 17 n/mm). the subligamentous measurements at the height of the greater trochanter in the unfixed corpse and intraoperatively during hip joint replacement showed an increase of the forces during adduction and a decrease during abduction of the hip joint. we found thereby a maximum increase up to 106 n with 40 degrees adduction. concerning the femoral neck angle, we can state that valgus leads to lower subligamentous forces and varus to higher subligamentous forces. the forces directed at the acetabulum, which were measured by the prosthesis with a sensor along the femoral neck, showed a decrease with varus angles and an increase with valgus angles. the highest force of 624 n was measured with 40 degrees adduction and an angle of 155 degrees. the finite element model of the proximal femur showed a sole hip joint-centralizing force of the it of 655 n with a femoral neck angle of 128 degrees after subtraction of the gluteal muscle force and the body weight. at 115 degrees, we found an increase up to 997 n and a decrease to 438 n at 155 degrees. concerning the resulting forces in the acetabulum, we found opposite forces in comparison with the force of the it at the height of the greater trochanter: at 115 degrees, a femoral head-centralizing force of 1601 n; at 128 degrees, 2360 n; and at 155 degrees, 2422 n. by our investigations, we can approximately prove the hip joint-centralizing force of the it. by variation of the femoral neck angle and the position of the hip joint, we can predict the subligamentous force of the it and the resulting force at the femoral head or at the acetabulum. the intraoperative measurement of the subligamentous forces of the it is a good monitoring mechanism for the persistent hip-centralizing function of the it in the course of hip joint replacement. the surgeon has the opportunity to check the stability of the hip joint after replacement. the finite element model gives the opportunity to check the divergent relative strength by variation of the femoral neck angle and the tension of the it. in this way, the changes in the forces induced by a displacement osteotomy could be estimated preoperatively.""]"

(2) pennation angle is significantly greater at mvc than at rest for all muscles tested; and (3) sex-specific values for optimal pennation angle should be used when modeling the force-generating potential of the primary muscles responsible for ankle plantar and dorsiflexion.', '1. human gastrocnemius medialis architecture was analysed in vivo, by ultrasonography, as a function of joint angle at rest and during voluntary isometric contractions up to the maximum force (mcv). maximum force (mvc). 2. at rest, as ankle joint angle increased from 90 to 150 deg, pennation increased from 15.8 to 27.7 deg, fibre length decreased from 57.0 to 34.0 mm and the physiological cross-sectional area (pcsa) increased from 42.1 to 63.5 cm2. 3. from rest to mvc, at a fixed ankle joint angle of 110 deg, pennation angle increased from 15.5 to 33.6 deg and fibre length decreased from 50.8 to 32.9 mm, with no significant change in the distance between the aponeuroses. as a result of these changes the pcsa increased by 34.8%. 4. measurements of pennation angle, fibre length and distance between the aponeuroses of the gastrocnemius medialis were also performed by ultrasound on a cadaver leg and found to be in good agreement with direct anatomical measurements. 5. it is concluded that human gastrocnemius medialis architecture is significantly affected both by changes of joint angle at rest and by isometric contraction intensity. the remarkable shortening observed during isometric contraction suggests that, at rest, the gastrocnemius muscle and tendon are considerably slack. the extrapolation of muscle architectural data obtained from cadavers to in vivo conditions should be made only for matching muscle lengths.']"

one of the hallmarks of complex arrhythmias. human 3d microtissues were generated by seeding hydrogel-embedded hipsc-cms and cardiac fibroblasts into an established microwell system designed to enable active and passive force assessment. cell-cell signaling was disrupted using methyl-beta cyclodextrin (mbcd), previously shown to disassemble cardiac gap junctions. we demonstrate that arrhythmias were progressive and present in all microtissues within 5 days of treatment. arrhythmic tissues exhibited reduced conduction velocity, an increased number of distinct action potentials, and reduced action potential cycle length. arrhythmic tissues also showed significant reduction in contractile force generation, increased beating frequency, and increased passive tension and collagen deposition, in line with fibrosis. a subset of tissues with more complex arrhythmias exhibited 3d spatial differences in action potential propagation. pharmacological and electrical defibrillation was successful. transcriptomic data indicated an enrichment of genes consistent with cardiac arrhythmias. mbcd removal reversed the arrhythmic phenotype, resulting in synchronicity despite not resolving fibrosis. this innovative & reliable human-relevant 3d acquired arrhythmia model shows potential for improving our understanding of arrhythmic action potential conduction and furthering therapeutic development. statement of significance: this work describes a 3d human model of cardiac arrhythmia-on-a-chip with high reproducibility, fidelity, and extensive functional applicability. to mimic in vivo conditions, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hipsc-cms) and cardiac fibroblasts from healthy controls were combined in a biocompatible fibrin hydrogel and seeded between two deflectable polymeric rods. using the innate functional properties of this 3d model as well as advanced optical imaging techniques we demonstrated dramatic changes in contraction rate, synchronicity, and electrophysiological conduction in arrhythmic tissues relative to controls. taken together, these data demonstrate the distinctive potential of this new model for pathophysiological studies, and for arrhythmia drug testing applications.']"

heart failure in the human and in a number of animal models. however, the majority of studies have examined end-stage heart failure in the human and few animal studies have taken account of the duration and severity of left ventricular dysfunction. in this study we have compared sr ca2+ loading in a haemodynamically assessed, coronary artery ligation model of heart failure at 8 and 15 weeks after ligation. trabeculae were isolated from the right ventricle and mounted for isometric tension measurement. they were treated with saponin to permeabilize the sarcolemma but retain sr function and bathed in a mock intracellular solution including adenosine triphosphate (atp) and buffered ca2+. caffeine was used to release ca2+ from the sr. the amplitude of the caffeine-induced contracture was used as a quantitative gauge of the ca2+ content of the sr. eight weeks after ligation, trabeculae demonstrated enhanced sr ca2+ uptake as manifest by larger caffeine-induced contractures (e.g. 200 nm [ca2+], 120 s loading - 38.2+/-9.2 versus 67.3+/-10.1% of maximum ca2+-activated force, fca, max, p=0.03). at 15 weeks, trabeculae from ligated hearts were not significantly different from

the early stages of heart failure and fall back to normal with an increasing duration of left ventricular dysfunction. increased incidence of spontaneous ca2+ release observed from the sr at 8 weeks and not at 15 weeks may represent an arrhythmogenic mechanism specific to the early phase of heart failure.', 'the heart is a major target organ for thyroid hormone action, and marked changes occur in cardiac function in patients with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. triiodothyronine (t3)-induced changes in cardiac function can result from direct or indirect t3 effects. direct t3 effects result from t3 action in the heart itself and are mediated by nuclear or extranuclear mechanisms. extranuclear t3 effects, which occur independently of nuclear t3 receptor binding and increases in protein synthesis, influence primarily the transport of amino acids, sugars, and calcium across the cell membrane. nuclear t3 effects are mediated by the binding of t3 to specific nuclear receptor proteins, which results in increased transcription of t3-responsive cardiac genes. the t3 receptor is a member of the ligand-activated transcription factor family and is encoded by cellular erythroblastosis a (c-erb a) genes. t3 increases the heart transcription of the myosin heavy chain (mhc) alpha gene and decreases the transcription of the mhc beta gene, leading to an increase of myosin v1 and a decrease in myosin v3 isoenzymes. myosin v1, which is composed of two mhc alpha, has a higher myosin atpase activity than myosin v3, which contains two mhc beta. the globular head of myosin v1, with its higher atpase activity, leads to a more rapid movement of the globular head of myosin along the thin filament, resulting in an increased velocity of contraction. t3 also leads to an increase in the speed of diastolic relaxation, which is caused by the more efficient pumping of the calcium atpase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr). this t3 effect results from t3-induced increases in the level of the mrna coding for the sr calcium atpase protein, leading to an increased number of calcium atpase pump units in the sr. overall, t3 leads to an increase in atp consumption in the heart. in addition, less chemical energy of atp is used for contractile purposes and more of it goes toward heat production, which causes a decreased efficiency of the contractile process in the hyperthyroid heart. the pathophysiologic basis for myxedema is the opposite of that discussed for the hyperthyroid heart. in addition to decreased direct effects of thyroid hormone in cardiac myocytes, indirect effects occur through decreases in peripheral oxygen consumption and changes in hemodynamic parameters. myofibrillar swelling with loss of striation and interstitial fibrosis occurs on histologic examination of hypothyroid hearts. in addition, accumulation of mucopolysaccharide substances (glycosaminoglycans) can be demonstrated. on electron microscopic examination, mitochondria show disruption and lipid inclusion. cardiac papillary muscle obtained from animals with hypothyroidism shows a depression of the force velocity curve and reduced rate of tension development, indicating significant contractile abnormalities. in patients with hypothyroidism, a true enhanced incidence of hypertension (increased peripheral vascular resistance) has been found. in addition, hypercholesterolemia and impairment of fatty acid mobilization are associated with myxedema and present additional risk factors for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.', 'in the present study, the ca2(+)-sensitivity and myosin light chain patterns of skinned fibers of right atrium and left papillary muscles of 27 patients suffering from mitral valve disease (mvd, moderate heart failure), ischemic cardiomyopathy (icm, severe heart failure), dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm, severe heart failure), and coronary heart disease (chd, no heart failure, no atrial hypertrophy) were investigated. myosin light chains of both chemically skinned and intact samples were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2d-page). ca2(+)-sensitivity of ventricular fibers was about 0.14 pca-units higher than that of atrial fibers in all groups except dilated cardiomyopathy where this difference was markedly diminished (only 0.06 pca-units). generally, ca2(+)-sensitivity of skinned ventricular fibers was the same among the different heart diseases. skinned atrial fibers from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, however, were significantly (about 0.08 pca-units) more sensitive for ca2+ than those of the other groups (coronary heart disease, mitral valve disease or ischemic cardiomyopathy) which showed similar ca2(+)-tension relationships. ventricle-specific p-light chain forms could be observed in atrial samples from patients of all groups, whereas no atrium-specific light chain forms were detectable in any ventricular sample. it is concluded that there is no difference in ca2(+)-sensitivity of the ventricular contractile elements of the human heart in different heart diseases. in atrial myocardium, there is an increased ca2(+)-sensitivity of skinned fibers from hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy which is probably related to an elevation of right atrial pressure.']"

labor induction and preterm labor. this study aimed to assess the physiological role of alternative calcium conductance on contractions triggered by uterotonic drugs in human myometrium. membrane conductances, supported by trpv channels, may provide alternative pathways to control either free intracellular and/or submembrane ca(2+)-concentration, which in turn will modulate membrane polarization and contractile responses. study design: uterine biopsies were obtained from consenting women undergoing elective caesarean delivery at term without labor (n = 22). isometric tension measurements were performed on uterine smooth muscle strips (n = 132). amplitude, frequency, and area under the curve (auc) of phasic contractions, as well as resting tone, were measured under various experimental conditions. immuno histo- and cyto-chemistry, as well as western blot analyses, have been performed with specific antibodies against trpv1, trpv3, and trpv4 proteins. trpv4 agonists; gsk1016790a, 4αpdd, and 5,6-eet were used to assess the role of trpv4 channels on rhythmic activity triggered by 30-300 nm oxytocin. 5 μm of ruthenium red was used as an efficient blocker of ionic current through trpv4 channels. nanomolar concentrations of iberiotoxin (ibtx) were also used to confirm the downstream involvement of bkca channels in controlling uterine reactivity and contractility. results: the expression of trpv3 and trpv4 isoforms has now been demonstrated in human myometrial tissue and cell culture. nanomolar concentrations of the trpv4 agonists, (either gsk1016790a or 4αpdd) abolished the rhythmic contractions, resulting in a rapid and consistent tocolytic effect. while 5 μm of ruthenium reversed this tocolytic effect. the addition of ibtx (a bkca channel blocker) reversed the effects of gsk1016790a. carvacrol, a trpv3 agonist, had similar tocolytic effects on rhythmic contractions albeit at higher concentrations. this inhibitory effect was also reversed by ruthenium red. conclusion: collectively, these data suggest that activation of trpv4 leads to a ca(2+) entry and subsequent bkca channel activation (increase in open state probability), which in turn hyperpolarizes the myometrial cell membrane, inactivating l-type ca(2+) channels and efficiently abrogates contractile activity. consequently, alternative ca(2+) conductance supported by trpv4 plays a physiological role in the modulation of myometrial reactivity.', 'in this review, we describe a new model to explain the regulation of myometrial function during pregnancy and labour. we propose that the myometrium undergoes dramatic changes in phenotype from early pregnancy until the onset of labour, characterized by an early proliferative phase, an intermediate phase of cellular hypertrophy and matrix elaboration, a third phase in which the cells assume a contractile phenotype and the final phase in which cells become highly active and committed to labour. the last phase of myometrial differentiation is postpartum uterine involution, completing the reproductive cycle following pregnancy and labour by returning the uterus to its non-pregnant receptive state. we further propose that phenotypic modulation of the uterine myocytes is the result of integration of endocrine signals and mechanical stimulation of the uterus by the growing fetus. our previous studies have shown that these signals are important in regulating the onset of labour and we now have indications that they regulate earlier myometrial smooth muscle differentiation. we show that the high rate of myometrial cell proliferation in early pregnancy which reflects important aspects of many smooth muscle populations during development. the proliferative phenotype was associated with dramatic changes in the expression of igf family proteins and coincided with an up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic pathway. preliminary evidence suggests that myometrial hyperplasia was controlled by the pi3k-akt-mtor signaling pathway. the modulation of the mtor pathway by rapamycin blocked the proliferative activity of the uterine myocytes. the growth and remodeling of the myometrium during pregnancy was associated with increased synthesis of extra cellular matrix (ecm) proteins and their corresponding integrin receptors. our results show a decrease in expression of fibrillar collagens and a coordinated temporal increase in expression of components of the basement membrane near term associated with decreased progesterone levels and increased mechanical tension. the phenotypic modulation of uterine smooth muscle cells during pregnancy culminates at term when a myometrium-specific conversion commits these cells to the labour phenotype, characterized by increased excitability, spontaneous activity, responsiveness to agonists and effective coupling of the myocytes. the reinforcement of the ecm-integrin interaction contributes to myometrial hypertrophy and remodeling during late pregnancy and facilitates force transduction during the contractions of labour by anchoring hypertrophied smcs to the uterine ecm. in addition, we suggest that myometrial cells play an important role in the generation and regulation of uterine inflammation, which is a characteristic feature of parturition. we provide here substantial evidence that myometrial cells can actively participate in the inflammatory process in the uterus by the release of the pro-inflammatory chemokine mcp-1. the increased production of mcp-1 in the term myometrium was associated with uterine occupancy and regulated by progesterone, suggesting that mechanical and endocrine signals integrate to regulate the expression of the chemokine and the induction of labour. a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating myometrial differentiation during pregnancy might inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for the management of preterm labour, which remains a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. our data are obtained mostly from the rat, but we believe that they are generally applicable across species.', ""preterm birth at <37 weeks of gestation is the most common and costly complication of pregnancy and remains the leading cause of neonatal morbidity, death, and reduced achievement in surviving infants. magnesium sulfate is 1 class of tocolytics for threatened preterm labor; however, its clinical efficacy has been questioned. twin pregnancies are at increased risk of preterm delivery compared with singleton gestations, which suggests that there is twin-specific risk to preterm delivery in twins. the prevention strategies that are applied to singleton pregnancies, however, have not been shown to be effective in twin pregnancies. the purpose of this study was to compare the relaxant effect of magnesium sulfate on spontaneous and oxytocin-augmented contractions of human myometrium from singleton and twin pregnancies and to examine whether the effect of oxytocin on magnesium sulfate's potency could be reversed with the use of the oxytocin receptor antagonist, atosiban. study design: myometrium was obtained at the time of prelabor cesarean section (36-40 weeks of gestation) from women with singleton (n=23) or twin (n=12) pregnancy. isometric tension recordings were made on myometrial strips that were mounted in organ baths that were superfused with physiologic saline solution. strips were exposed to rising concentrations of magnesium sulfate, and the effect on spontaneous contractions or stimulated with oxytocin (0.5 nmol/l) and in the presence or absence of atosiban (100 nmol/l) was recorded. the contractile characteristics after each application of magnesium sulfate, which included amplitude of contraction and activity integral, were measured. concentration-response curves were fitted with the use of nonlinear regression and comparison of the negative logarithm of the 50% reduction in activity values. results: magnesium sulfate exerted an equal concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on spontaneous myometrial contractions from both singleton and twin myometrium (p>.05). the application of oxytocin produced a significant rightward shift in the concentration-response curves (p<.0001), but no differences were found between pregnancy groups (p>.05). the addition of atosiban shifted concentration-response curves significantly back to the left for amplitude of contraction and activity integral in singletons (p<.0001). however, only activity integral was significantly reversed in twins (p<.01). conclusion: magnesium sulfate is equipotent in suppressing contractions in singleton and twin myometrium. oxytocin (0.5 nmol/l) significantly reduces the tocolytic potency of magnesium sulfate, which may explain, in part, magnesium sulfate's poor efficacy in vivo; however, this can be reversed partially by the use of an oxytocin receptor antagonist. combination tocolysis that involves oxytocin receptor antagonists requires further investigation.""]"

phosphorylation of cardiac troponin i (ctni) by protein kinase c is important in both long- and short-term regulation of cardiac function. to determine the specific functional effects of these phosphorylation sites (ser-43, ser-45, and thr-144), we measured tension and sliding speed of thin filaments in reconstituted preparations in which endogenous ctni was replaced with ctni phosphorylated by protein kinase c-epsilon or mutated to ctni-s43e/s45e/t144e, ctni-s43e/s45e, or ctni-t144e. we used detergent-skinned mouse cardiac fiber bundles to measure changes in ca(2+)-dependence of force. compared with controls, fibers reconstituted with phosphorylated ctni, ctni-s43e/s45e/t144e, or ctni-s43e/s45e were desensitized to ca(2+), and maximum tension was as much as 27% lower, whereas fibers reconstituted with ctni-t144e showed no change. in the in vitro motility assay actin filaments regulated by troponin complexes containing phosphorylated ctni or ctni-s43e/s45e/t144e showed both a decrease in ca(2+) sensitivity and maximum sliding speed compared with controls, whereas filaments regulated by ctni-s43e/s45e showed only decreased maximum sliding speed and filaments regulated by ctni-t144e demonstrated only desensitization to ca(2+). our results demonstrate novel site specificity of effects of pkc phosphorylation on ctni function and emphasize the complexity of modulation of the actin-myosin interaction by specific changes in the thin filament.', 'ctni(p82s) (ctni(p83s) in rodents) resides at the i-t arm of cardiac troponin i (ctni) and was initially identified as a disease-causing mutation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm). however, later studies suggested this may not be true. we recently reported that introduction of an hcm-associated mutation in either inhibitory-peptide (ctni(r146g)) or cardiac-specific n-terminus (ctni(r21c)) of ctni blunts the pka-mediated modulation on myofibril activation/relaxation kinetics by prohibiting formation of intrasubunit contacts between these regions. here, we tested whether this also occurs for ctni(p83s). ctni(p83s) increased both ca(2+) binding affinity to ctn (kca) and affinity of ctnc for ctni (kc-i), and eliminated the reduction of kca and kc-i observed for phosphorylated-ctni(wt). in isolated myofibrils, ctni(p83s) maintained maximal tension (tmax) and ca(2+) sensitivity of tension (pca50). for ctni(wt) myofibrils, pka-mediated phosphorylation decreased pca50 and sped up the slow-phase relaxation (especially for those ca(2+) conditions that heart performs in vivo). those effects were blunted for ctni(p83s) myofibrils. molecular-dynamics simulations suggested ctni(p83s) moderately inhibited an intrasubunit interaction formation between inhibitory-peptide and n-terminus, but this ""blunting"" effect was weaker than that with ctni(r146g) or ctni(r21c). in summary, ctni(p83s) has similar effects as other hcm-associated ctni mutations on troponin and myofibril function even though it is in the i-t arm of ctni.', 'two hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-associated cardiac troponin i (ctni) mutations, r146g and r21c, are located in different regions of ctni, the inhibitory peptide and the cardiac-specific n terminus. we recently reported that these regions may interact when ser-23/ser-24 are phosphorylated, weakening the interaction of ctni with cardiac tnc. little is known about how these mutations influence the affinity of cardiac tnc for ctni (kc-i) or contractile kinetics during β-adrenergic stimulation. here, we tested how ctni(r146g) or ctni(r21c) influences contractile activation and relaxation and their response to protein kinase a (pka). both mutations significantly increased ca(2+) binding affinity to ctn (kca) and kc-i. pka phosphorylation resulted in a similar reduction of kca for all complexes, but kc-i was reduced only with ctni(wt). ctni(wt), ctni(r146g), and ctni(r21c) were complexed into cardiac troponin and exchanged into rat ventricular myofibrils, and contraction/relaxation kinetics were measured ± pka phosphorylation. maximal tension (tmax) was maintained for ctni(r146g)- and ctni(r21c)-exchanged myofibrils, and ca(2+) sensitivity of tension (pca50) was increased. pka phosphorylation decreased pca50 for ctni(wt)-exchanged myofibrils but not for either mutation. pka phosphorylation accelerated the early slow phase relaxation for ctni(wt) myofibrils, especially at ca(2+) levels that the heart operates in vivo. importantly, this effect was blunted for ctni(r146g)- and ctni(r21c)-exchanged myofibrils. molecular dynamics simulations suggest both mutations inhibit formation of intra-subunit contacts between the n terminus and the inhibitory peptide of ctni that is normally seen with wt-ctn upon pka phosphorylation. together, our results suggest that ctni(r146g) and ctni(r21c) blunt pka modulation of activation and relaxation kinetics by prohibiting cardiac-specific n-terminal

deep fascia in 20 upper limbs was made in order to establish which kind of nerve fibres and endings are present in the deep muscular fascia. the flexor retinaculum and the lacertus fibrosus were also evaluated because they are anatomically hardly separable from the deep muscular fascia, although they have different functions. in particular, specimens were taken at the level of: (a) the expansion of pectoralis major onto the bicipital fascia, (b) the middle third of the brachial fascia, (c) the lacertus fibrosus, (d) the middle third of the antebrachial fascia, (e) the flexor retinaculum. this study demonstrated an abundant innervation of the fascia consisting in both free nerve endings and encapsulated receptors, in particular, ruffini and pacini corpuscles. however, differences in innervation were verified: the flexor retinaculum was resulted the more innervated element whilst lacertus fibrosus and the pectoralis major expansion the less innervated. these results suggest that the retinaculum has more a perceptive function whereas the tendinous expansions onto the fascia have mostly a mechanical role in the transmission of tension. the hypothesis that the fascia plays an important role in proprioception, especially dynamic proprioception, is therefore advanced. in fact, the fascia is a membrane that extends throughout the whole body and numerous muscular expansions maintain it in a basal tension. during a muscular contraction these expansions could also transmit the effect of the stretch to a specific area of the fascia, stimulating the proprioceptors in that area.', 'we examined 30 upper limbs in order to study the tendinous muscular insertions into the deep fascia and to verify whether they have a specific anatomical arrangement and to measure their resilience to traction. we have found that the fascia receives many tendinous muscular insertions, which are always present and exhibit a constant anatomical structure. in particular, the pectoralis major fascia always continues with the brachial fascia in two distinct ways: the fascia overlying the clavicular part of pectoralis major had an expansion towards the anterior brachial fascia, whereas the fascia covering its costal part extended into the medial brachial fascia and the medial intermuscular septum. the lacertus fibrosus was also composed by two groups of fibres: the main group was oriented downwards and medially, the second group longitudinally. the palmaris longus opened out into a fan-shape in the palm of the hand and sent some tendinous expansions to the flexor retinaculum and fascia overlying the thenar eminence muscles. in the posterior region of the arm, the fascia of the latissimus dorsi sent a fibrous lamina to the triceps brachial fascia. the triceps tendon inserted partially into the antebrachial fascia, while the extensor carpi ulnaris sent a tendinous expansion to the fascia of the hypothenar eminence. it is hypothesized that the tendinous muscular insertions maintain the fascia at a basal tension and create myofascial continuity between the different muscles actuating flexion and extension of the upper limb, stretching the fascia in different ways according to the different motor directions.', 'study design: the superficial and deep lamina of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia have been studied anatomically and biomechanically. in embalmed human specimens, the posterior layer has been loaded by simulating the action of various muscles. the effect has been studied using raster photography. to study the role of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia in load transfer between spine, pelvis, legs, and arms. summary of background data: it has been determined whether muscles such as the gluteus maximus, latissimus dorsi, erector muscle, and biceps femoris are functionally coupled via the thoracolumbar fascia. the caudal relations of the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia have not been previously studied. methods: dissection was directed to the bilaminar posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia of 10 human specimens. the superficial and deep lamina were studied using visual inspection and raster photography. tension to the posterior layer of the fascia was simulated by traction to various muscles and measured by studying the displacement in the posterior layer. results: traction to a variety of muscles caused displacement of the posterior layer. this implies that in vivo, the superficial lamina will be tensed by contraction of various muscles, such as the latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus and erector muscle, and the deep lamina by contraction of the biceps femoris. caudal to the level of l4 (in some specimens, l2-l3), tension in the posterior layer was transmitted to the contralateral side. conclusions: anatomic structures normally described as hip, pelvic, and leg muscles interact with so-called arm and spinal muscles via the thoracolumbar fascia. this allows for effective load transfer between spine, pelvis, legs, and arms--an integrated system. specific electromyographic studies should reveal whether the gluteus maximus muscle and contralateral latissimus dorsi muscle are functionally coupled, especially during rotation of the trunk. in that case, the combined action of these muscles assists in rotating the trunk, while simultaneously stabilizing the lower lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints.']"

value (22.5 n cm-2. loading the corresponding tendons to p0 resulted in significantly different strain among tendons (p < 0.01) with the largest strain observed in the fcu (3.68 +/- 0.31%) and the smallest strain observed in the ecrl (1.78 +/- 0.14%). further, strain magnitude was significantly positively correlated with the tendon length-to-fiber length ratio of the muscle-tendon unit, a measure of the intrinsic compliance of the muscle-tendon unit. theoretical modeling of the magnitude of muscle sarcomere shortening expected based on the measured biomechanical properties revealed a maximum sarcomere length decrease of about 0.6 micron for the fcu to a minimum of about 0.2 micron for the ecrb at p0. thus, tendon compliance may, but does not necessarily, result in significant modification of muscle force generation. the significant variation in tendon biomechanical properties was not observed using traditional elongation-to-failure methods on the same specimens. thus, the use of elongation-to-failure experiments for determination of tendon properties may not be reasonable when the purpose of such studies is to infer physiological function. these data indicate that muscle-tendon units show remarkable specialization and that tendon intrinsic properties accentuate the muscle architectural specialization already present.', 'sarcomere length was measured intraoperatively on five patients undergoing tendon transfer of the flexor carpi ulnaris (fcu) to the extensor digitorum communis (edc) for radial nerve palsy. the most significant result was that the absolute sarcomere length and sarcomere length operating range of the fcu increased after transfer into the edc (p < .001). preoperatively, with the wrist fully extended and fingers flexed, fcu sarcomere length was 4.22 +/- .24 microns and decreased to 3.19 +/- .05 microns as the wrist was fully flexed. this represented an overall sarcomere length range of 1.03 microns. after the tendon transfer using standard recommended techniques, all sarcomere lengths were significantly longer (p < .001). specifically, sarcomeres were 0.74 +/- .14 microns longer with the muscle in its fully lengthened position (4.96 +/- .43 microns with the wrist and digits flexed) and 0.31 +/- .16 microns longer with the fcu in the fully shortened position (3.50 +/- .06 microns with the wrist and digits extended). at these sarcomere lengths, the fcu muscle was predicted to develop relatively high force only during movement involving synergistic wrist flexion and finger extension. under the conditions of the procedures performed, the transferred fcu muscle was predicted to produce maximum force over the range of about 30 degrees of wrist flexion and 0 degree of finger flexion to 70 degrees of wrist extension and 90 degrees of finger flexion. while this is acceptable, a more desirable result was predicted to occur if the muscle was transferred at a longer length. in this latter case, greater stretch of the fcu during transfer (increasing sarcomere length to about 5 microns) was predicted to improve the transfer. the more highly stretched fcu was predicted to result in maximum force as the wrist and fingers progressed from about 60 degrees of wrist extension and 0 degree of finger flexion to 80 degrees of wrist extension and 70 degrees of finger flexion. these results quantify the relationship between the passive tension chosen for transfer, sarcomere length, and the estimated active tension that can be generated by the muscle. the results also demonstrate the feasibility of using intraoperative laser diffraction during tendon transfer as a guide for optimal placement of the transferred muscle.', 'tendon transfer is often used to restore key pinch after cervical spinal cord injury. current postoperative recommendations include elbow immobilization in a flexed position to protect the brachioradialis-flexor pollicis longus (br-fpl) repair. the purpose of this study was to measure the br-fpl tendon tension across a range of wrist and elbow joint angles to determine whether joint motion could cause repair rupture. methods: we performed br-to-fpl tendon transfers on fresh-frozen cadaveric arms (n = 8) and instrumented the br-fpl tendon with a buckle transducer. arms were ranged at 4 wrist angles from 45 degrees of flexion to 45 degrees of extension and 8 elbow angles from 90 degrees of flexion to full extension, measuring tension across the br-fpl repair at each angle. subsequently, the br-fpl tendon constructs were removed and elongated to failure. results: over a wide wrist and elbow range of motion, br-fpl tendon tension was under 20 n. two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures revealed a significant effect of wrist joint angle (p<.001) and elbow joint angle (p<.001) with significant interaction between elbow and joint angles (p<.001). because the failure load of the repair site was 203 +/- 19 n, over 10 times the loads that would be expected to occur at the repair site, our results demonstrate that the repair has a safety factor of at least 10. conclusions: our tendon force measurements support the assertion that the elbow joint need not be immobilized when the br is used as a donor muscle in tendon transfer to the fpl. this is based on the fact that maximum passive tendon tension was only about 20 n in our cadaveric model and the failure strength of this specific repair was over 200 n. we suggest that it is possible to consider performing multiple tendon transfers in a single stage, avoiding immobilization, which may adversely affect functional recovery. these results must be qualified by the fact that issues unique to living tissues such as postoperative edema and tendon gliding cannot be accounted for by this cadaveric model.']"

no prospective clinical trials have been performed. immediate reconstruction is feasible if the skin flaps will accept the slight tension produced by either a subpectoral implant or a transposed muscle flap. a subpectoral silicone implant produces a satisfactory cosmetic result in the majority of patients, particularly if both breasts are supported by a properly fitting brassiere. in long-term follow-up, infection, contracture, and displacement requiring removal and reinsertion occur in approximately 15% of patients. reconstruction by a myocutaneous flap is a technically more difficult operation. the operating time is prolonged significantly and blood loss is increased. in my opinion, a myocutaneous flap probably is not worth the risk of a heterologous transfusion. the long-term cosmetic results, however, are considerably better in comparison to a subpectoral silicone implant. the reconstructed breast is much more mobile, making it a more realistic replacement of the original breast. in most cases, it is better to perform this type of reconstruction with a myocutaneous flap as a delayed procedure. in experienced hands, however, immediate reconstruction, with the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap harvested while the modified radical mastectomy is being performed, is perfectly feasible. nipple/areolar reconstruction is available. however, the cosmetic results are only fair to good, and the patient should be aware of this before undergoing the procedure. the problem of symmetry between the breasts requires a good deal of judgment.(abstract truncated at 400 words)"", 'various common locations of pressure sores require specific considerations. the most commonly used flap for the treatment of trochanteric ulcers is the tensor fascia lata (tfl) flap. according to our experience with the original flap, excessive tension and eventual suture separation at the confluence of the donor site flaps and the tfl flap is the most common problem. the purpose of this article is to present a new design for the tfl flap for the coverage of trochanteric pressure sores. an anterior triangular extension is designed exactly at a point where the flaps that will cover the donor site unite after transposition. the desepithelialized proximal part of the flap is folded into the pouch and sutured. the duck flap was applied to 31 trochanteric pressure sores in 27 patients with no major complications. this modification has many advantages: (1) the flap is reliable and easily designed, (2) formation of dead space and cone-shaped dog-ear deformity due to rotation is prevented, (3) better esthetic results are achieved, (4) suture separation is prevented via a tension-free closure, (5) the desepithelialized part produces tight attachment of the flap to the recipient bed, (6) as no muscle tissue is included, the flap is more resistant to pressure.', 'introduction: the goal of lower extremity reconstruction after trauma is the coverage of defects to give patients a healed wound and to let them resume their life, ambulate and return to work, while preventing amputation. in this article, we describe an innovative use of integra® for free flap pedicle coverage in lower extremity reconstruction. materials and methods: between january 2011 and december 2015, ten patients, four women and six men, underwent a lower limb reconstruction with an association of free flap and integra® to cover the flap pedicle. the mean age of the patients was 38.8±15.6 years at the time of surgery (range of 14-59 years). the mean defect size was 102±54 cm(2) (range of 40-160 cm(2)). the bone and/or tendons were exposed at the level of the middle third of the leg in 2 cases, at the level of the distal leg in 5 cases and at the level of the foot in 3 cases. results: there were no intra-operative complications. mean size of integra® needed for flap pedicle coverage was 12.8±2.3 cm(2) (range 10-15 cm(2)). the mean follow-up was 41±19 months (range 21-70 months). revision surgery was necessary in three cases due to haematoma of the pedicle. in these cases, the dermal substitute was easily removed while awaiting revision. this allowed flap survival in all cases. a skin graft was performed after a mean time of 3.4±0.8 weeks post-operatively. complications at the donor site level included one seroma and a case of hypertrophic scar. complete healing of both the donor and recipient sites was achieved in all cases. conclusions: the combination of free flap and integra® appears to be a useful option in covering complex defects in the lower limb. the dermal substitute avoids skin tension and compression of the pedicle. haematomas of the pedicle, if they occur, are highly visible and thus easy to manage. we hypothesize that the use of dermal substitute for this specific indication of pedicle coverage will expand in the near future.']"

fundamental goal for the theoretical progress in sensorimotor control and its engineering applications, e.g., in the biomimetic control of artificial limbs. yet, accurate models require extensive experimental measures to validate structural and functional parameters describing muscle state over the full physiological range of motion. however, available experimental measurements of, for example, muscle moment arms are sparse and often disparate. validation of these models is not trivial because of the highly complex anatomy and behavior of human limbs. in this study, we developed a method to validate and scale kinematic muscle parameters using posture-dependent moment arm profiles, isometric force measurements, and a computational detection of assembly errors. we used a previously published model with 18 degrees of freedom (dofs) and 32 musculotendon actuators with force generated from a hill-type muscle model. the muscle path from origin to insertion with wrapping geometry was used to model the muscle lengths and moment arms. we simulated moment arm profiles across the full physiological range of motion and compared them to an assembled dataset of published and merged experimental profiles. the muscle paths were adjusted using custom metrics based on root-mean-square and correlation coefficient of the difference between simulated and experimental values. since the available measurements were sparse and the examination of high-dimensional muscles is challenging, we developed analyses to identify common failures, i.e., moment arm functional flipping due to the sign reversal in simulated moments and the imbalance of force generation between antagonistic groups in postural extremes. the validated model was used to evaluate the expected errors in torque generation with the assumption of constant instead of the posture-dependent moment arms at the wrist flexion-extension dof, which is the critical joint in our model with the largest number of crossing muscles. we found that there was a reduction of joint torques by about 35% in the extreme quartiles of the wrist dof. the use of realistic musculoskeletal models is essential for the reconstruction of hand dynamics. these models may improve the understanding of muscle actions and help in the design and control of artificial limbs in future applications.', 'biomechanical models of the musculoskeletal system are frequently used to study neuromuscular control and simulate surgical procedures. to be broadly applicable, a model must be accessible to users, provide accurate representations of muscles and joints, and capture important interactions between joints. we have developed a model of the upper extremity that includes 15 degrees of freedom representing the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, thumb, and index finger, and 50 muscle compartments crossing these joints. the kinematics of each joint and the force-generating parameters for each muscle were derived from experimental data. the model estimates the muscle-tendon lengths and moment arms for each of the muscles over a wide range of postures. given a pattern of muscle activations, the model also estimates muscle forces and joint moments. the moment arms and maximum moment-generating capacity of each muscle group (e.g., elbow flexors) were compared to experimental data to assess the accuracy of the model. these comparisons showed that moment arms and joint moments estimated using the model captured important features of upper extremity geometry and mechanics. the model also revealed coupling between joints, such as increased passive finger flexion moment with wrist extension. the computer model is available to researchers at http://nmbl.stanford.edu.']"

another 34 hearts had a bifoliate valve and the papillary muscles abnormally oriented; a solitary papillary muscle in 3, two papillary muscles but deviated in 5, one of two papillary muscles being dysmorphic in 9, and three or more papillary muscles in 17. the origin of these papillary muscles was frequently deviated. in 5 hearts with a trifoliate or quadrifoliate valve, multiple papillary muscles were also the case. one of these had thick leaflets, a part of which was adherent to a membranous flap around the ventricular septal defect as well as to subpulmonary fibrous tissue tags.

origins on the papillary muscles. the fe model incorporated human age- and gender-matched anisotropic hyperelastic material properties, and mv closure at systole was simulated. the model was validated by comparing the fe results from valve closure simulation with the in vivo geometry of the mv at systole. it was found that the fe model could not replicate the in vivo mv geometry without the application of tethering pre-tension force in the chordae at diastole. upon applying the pre-tension force and performing model optimization by adjusting the chordal length, position, and leaflet length, a good agreement between the fe model and the in vivo model was established. not only were the chordal forces high at both diastole and systole, but the tethering force on the anterior papillary muscle was higher than that of the posterior papillary muscle, which resulted in an asymmetrical gap with a larger orifice area at the anterolateral commissure resulting in mr. the analyses further show that high peak stress and strain were found at the chordal insertions where large chordal tethering forces were found. this study shows that the pre-tension tethering force plays an important role in accurately simulating the mv dynamics in this fmr patient, particularly in quantifying the degree of leaflet coaptation and stress distribution. due to the complexity of the disease, the patient-specific computational modeling procedure of fmr patients presented should be further evaluated using a large patient cohort. however, this study provides useful insights into the mv biomechanics of a fmr patient, and could serve as a tool to assist in pre-operative planning for mv repair or replacement surgical or interventional procedures.', 'during the normal opening and closing of the mitral valve there is a finely tuned interaction between the changing ventricular dimensions and fluid pressures, the movement of papillary muscles apically, posteriorly and apart during diastole and in the opposite direction during systole, interactions between leaflets and their controlling cords, and the fluid dynamic forces being exerted on them. the main rough zone cords and the smooth zone of the anterior leaflet are under maximum tension in systole, but retain some tension throughout the cycle. the free edge cords and the rough zone of the leaflets can have no or minimal tension during diastole, and much less tension than the main rough zone cords and the smooth zone in systole. the variability of the form and distribution of rough zone cords influences the flexibility of the rough zone. the net effect of this interaction is a valve that opens rapidly for unobstructed forward flow, and closes at the end of the cycle with minimal leakage. the apical displacement of, usually, the right inferior papillary muscle as a result of ischemic ventricular disease pulls the leaflets into separation because the origins of cords supporting the anterior and posterior leaflets arise specifically from the anterior and posterior sides of each papillary muscle. myocardial ischemia producing apical papillary displacement can be associated with heart failure and mitral insufficiency. annuloplasty reducing the annulus to less than the normal systolic dimension can be effective in eliminating both insufficiency and heart failure when the papillary displacement is dominantly apical. in more severe cases of heart failure and mitral insufficiency, the mid-ventricular dimensions increase to a more severe degree, and both papillary muscles are displaced outwards and posteriorly. methods and results: static in vitro experiments performed on three human and nine pig hearts showed that the outward papillary displacements increased the tension on first-order cords, rendering the anterior leaflet and the central scallop of the posterior leaflet stiff. the addition of posterior displacement caused the anterior leaflet to become directed at an angle to the displaced papillary muscles, and the scallops of the posterior leaflet to be perpendicularly splayed around the posterior left ventricular wall, such that the valve no longer opened or closed correctly. conclusion: the valve no longer opens or closes properly, and annuloplasty is no longer of use in restoring valve function.']"

87.3 ± 7.7 kg) with at least 2 years of experience in resistance training. the study participants were divided randomly into two groups: the supplemented group ingested caffeine before exercise (g(caf)), while the control group was given a placebo (g(con)). the exercise protocol consisted of performing the bench press movement with a load equal to 70%1rm with maximal possible velocity (x/0/x/0). the experimental sets were performed to momentary muscular failure. results: the repeated measures anova between the g(caf) and g(con) groups revealed statistically significant differences in 2 variables. post-hoc tests demonstrated statistically significant differences in tut when comparing the group supplemented with caffeine (13.689 s g(caf)) to the one ingesting a placebo (15.332 s g(con)) at p = 0.002. significant differences were also observed in mean velocity during the eccentric phase of movement (0.690 m/s in the g(caf) to 0.609 in g(con) with p = 0.002). there were no significant differences in generated power and velocity in the con phase of the movement between the g(caf) and g(con.) conclusions: the main finding of the study is that caf ingestion increases movement velocity of the bar in the eccentric phase of the movement, what results in shortening of the time under tension (tut) needed for performing a specific number of repetitions, without decreasing power and velocity in the con phase of the movement.', 'concurrent improvements in aerobic capacity and muscle hypertrophy in response to a single mode of training have not been reported. we examined the effects of low-intensity cycle exercise training with and without blood flow restriction (bfr) on muscle size and maximum oxygen uptake (vo2max). a group of 19 young men (mean age ± sd: 23.0 ± 1.7 years) were allocated randomly into either a bfr-training group (n=9, bfr-training) or a non-bfr control training group (n=10, con-training), both of which trained 3 days/wk for 8 wk. training intensity and duration were 40% of vo2max and 15 min for the bfr-training group and 40% of vo2max and 45 min for the con-training group. mri-measured thigh and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area and muscle volume increased by 3.4-5.1% (p < 0.01) and isometric knee extension strength tended to increase by 7.7% (p < 0.10) in the bfr-training group. there was no change in muscle size (~0.6%) and strength (~1.4%) in the con-training group. significant improvements in vo2max (6.4%) and exercise time until exhaustion (15.4%) were observed in the bfr-training group (p < 0.05) but not in the con-training group (-0.1 and 3. 9%, respectively). the results suggest that low-intensity, short-duration cycling exercise combined with bfr improves both muscle hypertrophy and aerobic capacity concurrently in young men. key pointsconcurrent improvements in aerobic capacity and muscle hypertrophy in response to a single mode of training have not been reported.in the present study, low-intensity (40% of vo2max) cycle training with bfr can elicit concurrent improvement in muscle hypertrophy and aerobic capacity.']"
