The lower values could not be explained by submaximal activation of the quadriceps since it was demonstrated by the twitch-superimposition technique that the subjects were able to produce maximum contractions. The force measured was that generated at the ankle through the lever system of the knee and lower leg. Assuming a mechanical advantage of 0.132 (Narici et al. 1988; Smidt 1973), the forces generated in the patellar tendon would be 4515 N giving a specific force of 621 kN m-2 (calculated using the anatomical CSA). This value is comparable to those previously reported in the literature for the quadriceps."

2648,O'Brien 2010,In vivo measurements of muscle specific tension in adults and children.,UK,Cross sectional study,"The specific tensions reported here (∼55 N cm−2) are in line with those estimated in optimized musculoskeletal models (Cholewicki et al. 1995; Pain & Forrester, 2009),but notably higher than the typical values of ∼30 N cm−2reported in previous in vivo studies of the knee extensormuscles (Narici et al. 1992; Chow et al. 1999; Reeves et al. 2004). However, Chow et al. (1999) acknowledgedthat they had underestimated specific tension because of inaccurate estimates of fascicle pennation, failure to account for antagonist activation and the use of mean muscle force across a number of trials rather than maximal muscle force. Narici et al. (1992) and Reeves et al. (2004)did not account for the force that is lost in the transmission of quadriceps force through the patella to the tibia (Buffet al. 1988), and used F pt to calculate specific tension rather than Fquad. At the mean knee angle of 65 deg,this loss of force is equal to a third of Fquad. If the specific tension calculated in the present study had been calculated from the F pt, rather than Fquad, this would have resulted in estimates of ∼37 N cm−2, which are much closer to those previously reported. Additionally, in thepresent study F pt was calculated from PTMA lengthsmeasured at rest, which are smaller than those during contraction (Tsaopoulos et al. 2007). Had PTMA lengths during contraction been used, according to the findings of Tsaopoulos et al. (2007), the specific tension in the men would have been ∼34 N cm−2.

The specific tension values obtained in the present study are also much higher than those reported by Maganaris et al.(2001; 15 N cm−2).Such a large difference is most probably due to the fact that specific tension in that study was underestimated because muscle forces were not maximal, since the muscles studied were activated by percutaneous electrical stimulation, which is unlikely to recruit the whole muscle"

of this muscle should then be given by 448 N/46 cm2,
i.e. 9*7 N cm-2. This figure seems rather low compared with
the values of 38-3 and 25 N cm-2, respectively, reported by
Haxton (1944) in the same muscle group and by Narici et al.
(1992) in the human quadriceps, but is in line with the value
of 10-8 N cm-2 recently obtained by Fukunaga, Roy,
Shellock, Hodgson & Edgerton (1996) in the gastrocnemius."
4070,Reeves 2004,Effect of resistance training on skeletal muscle-specific force in elderly humans,UK,Randomised controlled trial,"Although previous studies in elderly humans have shown no increase in the specific tension of single fibers following strength training (47, 48), our in vivo results show that the specific force of whole muscle does increase. Training resulted in a 19% increase in specific force, from 27 to 32 N/cm2.Specific force values obtained in the present study are in line with previous reports of 15–38 N/cm2 obtained in human muscle (21, 30, 36) and 15–29 N/cm2 obtained in animal muscle (9, 39, 45). It should be stressed that, in contrast to single-fiber experiments where activation remains at a given level (47, 48), changes in activation level might occur when contractions are performed with voluntary effort, and this should be accounted for in the estimation of specific force. If specific force had been calculated from the voluntary torque only, the post training increase observed would partly reflect differences in the activation level found. However, this problem was largely avoided in the present study because, in both pre- and post training conditions, the calculation of specific force encompassed parameters measured at the time of supra-maximal electrical stimuli superimposed on the voluntary effort. Artificial maximal activation of the entire muscle would entirely eliminate this problem, but this would require supra-maximal tetanic stimulation through the femoral nerve, a procedure that may cause considerable discomfort, raising ethical considerations for its use with elderly populations."
4040,Morse 2008,Gastrocnemius muscle specific force in boys and men,UK,Cross sectional study,"The level of coactivation of the tibialis anterior was
assessed using the root mean square (RMS) of the raw EMG signal,
which was integrated over 1 s about the peak MVC torque during PF;
this was then expressed as the percentage EMG activity recorded from
the tibialis anterior during maximal dorsiflexion (21, 23, 24). Torque
produced by the dorsiflexors during plantarflexion was estimated
assuming a linear relation between torque and EMG activity, which
has previously been reported from the tibialis anterior muscle (29). To
obtain an estimate of plantarflexion peak torque, dorsiflexion torque
during plantarflexion was added to the net MVC plantarflexion torque."

2745,Valamatos 2018,Influence of full range of motion vs. equalized partial range of motion training on muscle architecture and mechanical properties.,Other: Portugal,Randomised controlled trial,"However, we would like to emphasize that in the present study, the spe-cific tension only increased significantly in response to the muscle excursion range used in the FULL group. To our knowledge, such a result has not been reported previously. Although increases in specific tension after high-intensity resistance training have been reported previously (Erskine et al. 2010; Reeves et al. 2004), this is the first study report-ing differential adaptations to full vs. partial ROM. As PART ROM training-induced changes in the VL PCSA (7.8%) and fascicle force (20.2%), the VL specific tension remained unchanged in the PART group. Conversely, because FULL training increased both the FL and muscle volume (4.9 and 7.6% increase, respectively), the PCSA remained unchanged in the FULL group. Consequently, FULL training induced an increase in the VL specific tension (i.e., maximum muscle force per PCSA), as a result of a disproportionate increase in the fascicle force relative to the PCSA (29.7 and 2.5% increase, respectively). This discrepancy between the increase in muscle strength and size often reported follow-ing resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010) is commonly explained by the neural adaptations being greater than the muscle hypertrophy (Staron et al. 1994). However, the voluntary quadriceps muscle activation in the FULL group increased only 1.8% (nonsignificant, Table 4), which is quite similar to previous reports of increased muscle activa-tion after resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010; Reeves et al. 2004). Furthermore, although there was a trend toward decreases, there was no significant change in the level of antagonist muscle coactivation following training (− 16%, without statistical significance, Table 4). Therefore, correct-ing MVC for voluntary muscle activation, antagonist muscle coactivation and ⅆPT (which remained unchanged after train-ing) gave a 27.8% increase in the maximal quadriceps force (Table 4), thus demonstrating that training-induced changes in voluntary activation, coactivation and ⅆPT contributed little (4.2%) to the increase in MVC torque. Although we cannot deduce the source for the VL specific tension increase in the FULL group from the present results, some explanations have been presented as being able to cause the change in whole-muscle specific tension (Erskine et al. 2010). Among the factors that may explain this phenomenon are the increase in the number of thick myofilaments per unit area (packing density) (Pansarasa et al. 2009), a change in muscle fiber-type composition and/or preferential muscle fiber hypertrophy of type II fibers (Campos et al. 2002), and/or a possible change in the quality of attachment between the contractile muscle fibers and the surrounding connective tis-sue through which force is transmitted to tendons and bones (Erskine et al. 2010)"
