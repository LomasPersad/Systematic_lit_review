Specific tension of human plantar flexors and dorsiflexors.,Fukunaga T; Roy RR; Shellock FG; Hodgson JA; Edgerton VR,"Reported specific tension measurements for human skeletal muscle vary widely. This variability could be due, at least in part, to the determination of the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of the muscles. In the present study, serial magnetic resonance images were taken every 10 mm along the lower leg of 8 male subjects to calculate the volume and subsequently the PCSAs of the individual muscles producing plantar flexor and dorsiflexor torques. Maximum plantar flexor and dorsiflexor voluntary isometric torques were determined at ankle joint angles of 90, 100, 110, and 120 degrees. Peak tendon force estimated from torque and moment arm measurements was more than fourfold higher in the plantar flexors (3,623 +/- 136 N) than in the dorsiflexors (832 +/- 19 N). PCSAs were about eight- and threefold higher than the anatomic cross-sectional areas at the level of maximum girth of the calf for the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor groups, respectively. Mean muscle volume and PCSA were 4.6 and 12 times larger in the plantar flexors compared with the dorsiflexors, respectively. The PCSAs of both plantar flexors (r = 0.92) and dorsiflexors (r = 0.80) were highly correlated with the tendon tension of the respective muscle groups. The maximum specific tension was more than twofold higher in dorsiflexors than in plantar flexors. These data suggest that factors other than PCSA contribute to the force output potential of ankle plantar flexors and dorsiflexors in humans.",1996,Jan,J Appl Physiol (1985),80,1,158-65,,10.1152/jappl.1996.80.1.158,8847297,#2646,Fukunaga 1996,,Whole muscle
In vivo measurements of muscle specific tension in adults and children.,O'Brien TD; Reeves ND; Baltzopoulos V; Jones DA; Maganaris CN,"To better understand the effects of pubertal maturation on the contractile properties of skeletal muscle in vivo, the present study investigated whether there are any differences in the specific tension of the quadriceps muscle in 20 adults and 20 prepubertal children of both sexes. Specific tension was calculated as the ratio between the quadriceps tendon force and the sum of the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) multiplied by the cosine of the angle of pennation of each head within the quadriceps muscle. The maximal quadriceps tendon force was calculated from the knee extension maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) by accounting for EMG-based estimates of antagonist co-activation, incomplete quadriceps activation using the interpolation twitch technique and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measurements of the patellar tendon moment arm. The PCSA was calculated as the muscle volume, measured from MRI scans, divided by optimal fascicle length, measured from ultrasound images during MVC at the estimated angle of peak quadriceps muscle force. It was found that the quadriceps tendon force and PCSA of men (11.4 kN, 214 cm(2)) were significantly greater than those of the women (8.7 kN, 152 cm(2); P < 0.01). Both adult groups had greater values than the children (P < 0.01) but there were no differences between boys (5.2 kN, 99 cm(2)) and girls (6.1 kN, 102 cm(2)). Agonist activation was greater in men and women than in girls (P < 0.05), and antagonist activation was greater in men than in boys (P < 0.05). Moment arm length was greater in men than in boys or girls and greater in women than in boys (P < 0.05). The angle of pennation did not differ between the groups in any of the quadriceps heads. The specific tension was similar (P > 0.05) between groups: men, 55 +/- 11 N cm(-2); women, 57.3 +/- 13 N cm(-2); boys, 54 +/- 14 N cm(-2); and girls, 59.8 +/- 15 N cm(-2). These findings indicate that the increased muscle strength with maturation is not due to an increase in the specific tension of muscle; instead, it can be attributed to increases in muscle size, moment arm length and voluntary activation level.",2010,Jan,Exp Physiol,95,1,202-10,,10.1113/expphysiol.2009.048967,19748968,#2648,O'Brien 2010,,Whole muscle
In vivo specific tension of the human quadriceps femoris muscle.,Erskine RM; Jones DA; Maganaris CN; Degens H,"It is not known to what extent the inter-individual variation in human muscle strength is explicable by differences in specific tension. To investigate this, a comprehensive approach was used to determine in vivo specific tension of the quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle (Method 1). Since this is a protracted technique, a simpler procedure was also developed to accurately estimate QF specific tension (Method 2). Method 1 comprised calculating patellar tendon force (F (t)) in 27 young, untrained males, by correcting maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) for antagonist co-activation, voluntary activation and moment arm length. For each component muscle, the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was calculated as volume divided by fascicle length during MVC. Dividing F (t) by the sum of the four PCSAs (each multiplied by the cosine of its pennation angle during MVC) provided QF specific tension. Method 2 was a simplification of Method 1, where QF specific tension was estimated from a single anatomical CSA and vastus lateralis muscle geometry. Using Method 1, the variability in MVC (18%) and specific tension (16%) was similar. Specific tension from Method 1 (30 +/- 5 N cm(-2)) was similar to and correlated with that of Method 2 (29 +/- 5 N cm(-2); R (2) = 0.67; P < 0.05). In conclusion, most of the inter-individual variability in MVC torque remains largely unexplained. Furthermore, a simple method of estimating QF specific tension provided similar values to the comprehensive approach, thereby enabling accurate estimations of QF specific tension where time and resources are limited.",2009,Aug,Eur J Appl Physiol,106,6,827-38,,10.1007/s00421-009-1085-7,19468746,#2649,Erskine 2009,,Whole muscle
In vivo specific tension of human skeletal muscle.,Maganaris CN; Baltzopoulos V; Ball D; Sargeant AJ,"In this study, we estimated the specific tensions of soleus (Sol) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in six men. Joint moments were measured during maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and during electrical stimulation. Moment arm lengths and muscle volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging, and pennation angles and fascicular lengths were measured using ultrasonography. Tendon and muscle forces were modeled. Two approaches were followed to estimate specific tension. First, muscle moments during electrical stimulation and moment arm lengths, fascicular lengths, and pennation angles during MVC were used (data set A). Then, MVC moments, moment arm lengths at rest, and cadaveric fascicular lengths and pennation angles were used (data set B). The use of data set B yielded the unrealistic specific tension estimates of 104 kN/m(2) in Sol and 658 kN/m(2) in TA. The use of data set A, however, yielded values of 150 and 155 kN/m(2) in Sol and TA, respectively, which agree with in vitro results from fiber type I-predominant muscles. In fact, both Sol and TA are such muscles. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of accurate in vivo estimates of human muscle intrinsic strength.",2001,Mar,J Appl Physiol (1985),90,3,865-72,,10.1152/jappl.2001.90.3.865,11181594,#2651,Maganaris 2001,,Whole muscle
Inter-individual variability in the adaptation of human muscle specific tension to progressive resistance training.,Erskine RM; Jones DA; Williams AG; Stewart CE; Degens H,"Considerable variation exists between people in the muscle response to resistance training, but there are numerous ways muscle might adapt to overload that might explain this variable response. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the range of responses concerning the training-induced change in maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) knee joint torque, quadriceps femoris (QF) maximum muscle force (F), physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and specific tension (F/PCSA). It was hypothesized that the variable change in QF specific tension between individuals would be less than that of MVC. Fifty-three untrained young men performed progressive leg-extension training three times a week for 9 weeks. F was determined from MVC torque, voluntary muscle activation level, antagonist muscle co-activation and patellar tendon moment arm. QF specific tension was established by dividing F by QF PCSA, which was calculated from the ratio of QF muscle volume to muscle fascicle length. MVC torque increased by 26 ± 11% (P < 0.0001; range -1 to 52%), while F increased by 22 ± 11% (P < 0.0001; range -1 to 44%). PCSA increased by 6 ± 4% (P < 0.001; range -3 to 18%) and specific tension increased by 17 ± 11% (P < 0.0001; range -5 to 39%). In conclusion, training-induced changes in F and PCSA varied substantially between individuals, giving rise to greater inter-individual variability in the specific tension response compared to that of MVC. Furthermore, it appears that the change in specific tension is responsible for the variable change in MVC.",2010,Dec,Eur J Appl Physiol,110,6,1117-25,,10.1007/s00421-010-1601-9,20703498,#2653,Erskine 2010,,Whole muscle
What causes in vivo muscle specific tension to increase following resistance training?,Erskine RM; Jones DA; Maffulli N; Williams AG; Stewart CE; Degens H,"It is not known why in vivo muscle specific tension increases following resistance training in humans but changes in muscle fibre-type composition, increased single-fibre specific tension or lateral force transmission might provide explanations. Lateral force transmission would increase specific tension but decrease contraction velocity, thus not affecting maximal power per unit muscle volume. In vivo muscle specific tension, power output and muscle volume were determined in the quadriceps femoris of 42 young men, while myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoform composition, single-fibre (SF) specific tension, SF maximal shortening velocity (V(max)) and SF peak power (W(max)) of the vastus lateralis were established in a subsample (n = 17) before and after high-intensity leg-extension resistance training (3 sessions week(-1) for 9 weeks). Following training, in vivo muscle specific tension increased by 17% but the power output/muscle volume ratio remained unaltered. Furthermore, there was no relationship between the training-induced decrease in MyHC IIX and the change in specific tension in vivo. In addition, SF specific tension, V(max) and W(max) were unchanged following training. In conclusion, a change in fibre-type composition does not explain the increased in vivo specific tension, nor does it seem likely that increased myofilament packing occurred with resistance training. However, an unchanged in vivo power per unit muscle volume is in accordance with the notion of enhanced lateral force transmission after strength training.",2011,Feb,Exp Physiol,96,2,145-55,,10.1113/expphysiol.2010.053975,20889606,#2664,Erskine 2011,,Fiber; Whole muscle
Effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation parameters on specific tension.,Gorgey AS; Mahoney E; Kendall T; Dudley GA,"This study examined the effects of altering surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (SNMES) parameters on the specific tension of the quadriceps femoris muscle. Seven able-bodied subjects had magnetic resonance images taken of both thighs prior to and immediately after four SNMES protocols to determine the activated muscle cross-sectional area (CSA). The four protocols were: (1) research (RES, 100 Hz, 450 micros, and amplitude set to evoke 75% of maximal voluntary isometric torque, MVIT); (2) pulse duration (PD, 100 Hz, 150 micros, same current as in RES); (3) frequency (FREQ, 25 Hz, 450 micros, and same current as in RES); (4) amplitude (AMP, 100 Hz, 450 mus, and current set to evoke the average of the initial torques of PD and FREQ, 45 +/- 9% of MVIT). Reducing the amplitude of the current from 75 to 45% of MVIT did not alter specific tension, 25 +/- 8 N/cm2, suggesting that the amplitude probably affects torque and the area of activated muscle proportionally. Shortening the pulse duration from 450 to 150 micros caused specific tension to drop from 25 +/- 6 to 20 +/- 6 N/cm2 (P < 0.05), indicating that pulse duration increased torque and the activated CSA disproportionally. Alternatively, reducing the frequency from 100 to 25 Hz decreased specific tension from 25 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 4 N/cm2 (P < 0.05), suggesting that the frequency increased torque without affecting the activated CSA. Clinicians who administer SNMES should be aware of the magnitude of adaptations to a given amplitude, pulse duration, and frequency.",2006,Aug,Eur J Appl Physiol,97,6,737-44,,10.1007/s00421-006-0232-7,16821023,#2672,Gorgey 2006,,Stimulated; Whole muscle
Specific tension of elbow flexor and extensor muscles based on magnetic resonance imaging.,Kawakami Y; Nakazawa K; Fujimoto T; Nozaki D; Miyashita M; Fukunaga T,"Series cross-section images of the upper extremity were obtained for four men by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and anatomical cross-sectional areas (ACSA) of elbow flexor muscles [biceps brachii (BIC), brachialis (BRA), brachioradialis (BRD)] and extensor muscles [triceps brachii (TRI)] were measured. Physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was calculated from the muscle volume and muscle fibre length, the former from the series ACSA and the latter from the muscle length multiplied by previously reported fibre/muscle length ratios. Elbow flexion/extension torque was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer and the force at the tendons was calculated from the torque and moment arms of muscles measured by MRI. Maximal ACSA of TRI was comparable to that of total flexors, while PCSA of TRI was greater by 1.9 times. Within flexors, BRA had the greatest contribution to torque (47%), followed by BIC (34%) and BRD (19%). Specific tension related to the estimated velocity of muscle fibres were similar for elbow flexors and extensors, suggesting that the capacity of tension development is analogous between two muscle groups.",1994,,Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol,68,2,139-47,,10.1007/BF00244027,8194543,#2677,Kawakami 1994,,Whole muscle
Training-induced changes in muscle architecture and specific tension.,Kawakami Y; Abe T; Kuno SY; Fukunaga T,"Five men underwent unilateral resistance training of elbow extensor (triceps brachii) muscles for 16 weeks. Before and after training, muscle layer thickness and fascicle angles of the long head of the triceps muscle were measured in vivo using B-mode ultrasound, and fascicle lengths were estimated. Series anatomical cross-sectional areas (ACSA) of the triceps brachii muscle were measured by magnetic resonance imaging, from which muscle volume (Vm) was determined and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) was calculated. Elbow extension strength (isometric; concentric and eccentric at 30, 90 and 180 degrees.s-1) was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer to determine specific tension. Muscle volumes, ACSA, PCSA, muscle layer thickness and fascicle angles increased after training and their relative changes were similar, while muscle and fascicle length did not change. Muscle strength increased at all velocities; however, specific tension decreased after training. Increase in fascicle angles, which would be the result of increased Vm and PCSA, would seem to imply the occurrence of changes in muscle architecture. This might have given a negative effect on the force-generating properties of the muscles.",1995,,Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol,72,2-Jan,37-43,,10.1007/BF00964112,8789568,#2679,Kawakami 1995,,Whole muscle
Resistance training increases in vivo quadriceps femoris muscle specific tension in young men.,Erskine RM; Jones DA; Williams AG; Stewart CE; Degens H,"AIM: The present study investigated whether in vivo human quadriceps femoris (QF) muscle specific tension changed following strength training by systematically determining QF maximal force and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA). METHODS: Seventeen untrained men (20 +/- 2 years) performed high-intensity leg-extension training three times a week for 9 weeks. Maximum tendon force (F(t)) was calculated from maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) torque, corrected for agonist and antagonist muscle activation, and moment arm length (d(PT)) before and after training. QF PCSA was calculated as the sum of the four component muscle volumes, each divided by its fascicle length. Dividing F(t) by the sum of the component muscle PCSAs, each multiplied by the cosine of the respective fascicle pennation angle, provided QF specific tension. RESULTS: MVC torque and QF activation increased by 31% (P < 0.01) and 3% (P < 0.05), respectively, but there was no change in antagonist co-activation or d(PT). Subsequently, F(t) increased by 27% (P < 0.01). QF volume increased by 6% but fascicle length did not change in any of the component muscles, leading to a 6% increase in QF PCSA (P < 0.05). Fascicle pennation angle increased by 5% (P < 0.01) but only in the vastus lateralis muscle. Consequently, QF specific tension increased by 20% (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: An increase in human muscle specific tension appears to be a real consequence of resistance training rather than being an artefact of measuring errors but the underlying cause of this phenomenon remains to be determined.",2010,May,Acta Physiol (Oxf),199,1,83-9,,10.1111/j.1748-1716.2010.02085.x,20102343,#2680,Erskine 2010,,Whole muscle
Influence of full range of motion vs. equalized partial range of motion training on muscle architecture and mechanical properties.,Valamatos MJ; Tavares F; Santos RM; Veloso AP; Mil-Homens P,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 15-week partial range of motion (ROM) resistance training program on the vastus lateralis (VL) architecture and mechanical properties, when the time under tension (TUT) was equalized. METHODS: Nineteen untrained male subjects were randomly assigned to a control (Control; n = 8) or training (TG; n = 11) group. In the TG, the dominant and nondominant legs were randomly selected to be trained with a full ROM (FULL) or a partial ROM (PART) in an isokinetic dynamometer. Training volume was equalized based on the TUT by manipulating sets and repetitions. The VL muscle architecture was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography at rest and during maximal isometric knee extension contractions (MVCs) at ten knee angles. The VL fascicle force and specific tension were calculated from the MVCs with superimposed stimuli, accounting for the moment arm length, muscle architecture, and antagonist coactivation. RESULTS: The FULL training induced changes in fascicle length (FL) (4.9 ± 2.0%, P < 0.001) and specific tension (25.8 ± 18.7%, P < 0.001). There was a moderate effect of PART training on the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) (7.8 ± 4.0%, P < 0.001, d(av) = 0.6) and torque-angle adaptations (average increase 17.7 ± 3.9%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that crucial architectural and mechanical muscle adaptations are dependent on the ROM used in strength training. It seems that muscle FL and specific tension can be increased by pure concentric training if greater ROM is used. Conversely, restricting the ROM to shorter muscle lengths promotes a greater PCSA and angle-specific strength adaptations.",2018,Sep,Eur J Appl Physiol,118,9,1969-1983,,10.1007/s00421-018-3932-x,29982844,#2745,Valamatos 2018,,Whole muscle
Morphology of the brachial biceps muscle and elbow flexion in man.,Nygaard E; Houston M; Suzuki Y; Jørgensen K; Saltin B,"This study was undertaken to determine whether skeletal muscle fibre characteristics could be demonstrated to be of significance for muscle function in voluntary contraction in man. 4 male and 4 female adult subjects were studied. During elbow flexion force and velocity was measured at the hand with the forearm in a 100 degree position. A motor-driven heavy flywheel guaranteed a constant velocity or movement at the time of measurement. Force was registered by a straingauge dynamometer, and velocity by two sets of photocells. Cross-sectional area of the brachial biceps muscle was determined by computerized tomography scanning. Muscle fibre composition and fibre cross-sectional areas were assessed histochemically on needle biopsy samples obtained superficially from the brachial biceps muscle, the more superficial of the two large elbow flexor muscles. At contraction velocities from 2 to 7 radians per second (rad/s) a close relationship existed between the relative force output and the relative area of fast-twitch fibers (p less than 0.01). Maximal voluntary isometric contraction force averaged 189 N (120 to 309 N), and showed a close relationship with total cross-sectional area of the brachial biceps muscle. The specific tension (maximal isometric tension) of the muscle averaged 33 N/cm2 with no demonstrable difference between subjects of widely different fibre compositions, suggesting that maximal tetanic tension is similar in fast- and slow-twitch fibres in man.",1983,Feb,Acta Physiol Scand,117,2,287-92,,10.1111/j.1748-1716.1983.tb07208.x,6223510,#2820,Nygaard 1983,,Whole muscle; external force measured
Effects of low-load resistance training with vascular occlusion on the mechanical properties of muscle and tendon.,Kubo K; Komuro T; Ishiguro N; Tsunoda N; Sato Y; Ishii N; Kanehisa H; Fukunaga T,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of low-load resistance training with vascular occlusion on the specific tension and tendon properties by comparing with those of high-load training. Nine participants completed 12 weeks (3 days/week) of a unilateral isotonic training program on knee extensors. One leg was trained using low load (20% of 1 RM) with vascular occlusion (LLO) and other leg using high load (80% of 1 RM) without vascular occlusion (HL). Before and after training, maximal isometric knee extension torque (MVC) and muscle volume were measured. Specific tension of vastus lateralis muscle (VL) was calculated from MVC, muscle volume, and muscle architecture measurements. Stiffness of tendon-aponeurosis complex in VL was measured using ultrasonography during isometric knee extension. Both protocols significantly increased MVC and muscle volume of quadriceps femoris muscle. Specific tension of VL increased significantly 5.5% for HL, but not for LLO. The LLO protocol did not alter the stiffness of tendon-aponeurosis complex in knee extensors, while the HL protocol increased it significantly. The present study demonstrated that the specific tension and tendon properties were found to remain following low-load resistance training with vascular occlusion, whereas they increased significantly after high-load training.",2006,May,J Appl Biomech,22,2,112-9,,10.1123/jab.22.2.112,16871002,#2821,Kubo 2006,,Whole muscle
"What makes long-term resistance-trained individuals so strong? A comparison of skeletal muscle morphology, architecture, and joint mechanics.",Maden-Wilkinson TM; Balshaw TG; Massey GJ; Folland JP,"The greater muscular strength of long-term resistance-trained (LTT) individuals is often attributed to hypertrophy, but the role of other factors, notably maximum voluntary specific tension (ST), muscle architecture, and any differences in joint mechanics (moment arm), have not been documented. The aim of the present study was to examine the musculoskeletal factors that might explain the greater quadriceps strength and size of LTT vs. untrained (UT) individuals. LTT (n = 16, age 21.6 ± 2.0 yr) had 4.0 ± 0.8 yr of systematic knee extensor heavy-resistance training experience, whereas UT (n = 52; age 25.1 ± 2.3 yr) had no lower-body resistance training experience for >18 mo. Knee extension dynamometry, T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the thigh and knee, and ultrasonography of the quadriceps muscle group at 10 locations were used to determine quadriceps: isometric maximal voluntary torque (MVT), muscle volume (Q(VOL)), patella tendon moment arm (PTMA), pennation angle (QΘ(P)) and fascicle length (QF(L)), physiological cross-sectional area (QPCSA), and ST. LTT had substantially greater MVT (+60% vs. UT, P < 0.001) and Q(VOL) (+56%, P < 0.001) and QPCSA (+41%, P < 0.001) but smaller differences in ST (+9%, P < 0.05) and moment arm (+4%, P < 0.05), and thus muscle size was the primary explanation for the greater strength of LTT. The greater muscle size (volume) of LTT was primarily attributable to the greater QPCSA (+41%; indicating more sarcomeres in parallel) rather than the more modest difference in F(L) (+11%; indicating more sarcomeres in series). There was no evidence in the present study for regional hypertrophy after LTT.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here we demonstrate that the larger muscle strength (+60%) of a long-term (4+ yr) resistance-trained group compared with untrained controls was due to their similarly larger muscle volume (+56%), primarily due to a larger physiological cross-sectional area and modest differences in fascicle length, as well as modest differences in maximum voluntary specific tension and patella tendon moment arm. In addition, the present study refutes the possibility of regional hypertrophy, despite large differences in muscle volume.",2020,Apr,J Appl Physiol (1985),128,4,1000-1011,,10.1152/japplphysiol.00224.2019,31873069,#2833,Maden-Wilkinson 2020,,Whole muscle
Evaluation of the strength-size relationship in vivo using various muscle size indices.,Bamman MM; Newcomer BR; Larson-Meyer DE; Weinsier RL; Hunter GR,"PURPOSE: It is well accepted that maximum strength is related to muscle size. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether anthropometric or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) estimates of muscle size were valid predictors of plantar flexor maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) strength and could be used in lieu of more sophisticated techniques (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Additionally, we compared the relationship among MVC and three MRI-determined muscle size measures; anatomical (ACSA) and physiological (PCSA) cross-sectional areas; and muscle volume (VOLm). METHODS: We measured plantar flexor MVC at 1.83 rad and various indices of muscle size: 1) body weight, 2) total body lean mass (LM) (DEXA), 3) lower leg LM (DEXA), 4) lower leg circumference, 5) estimated muscle+bone cross-sectional area (CSA) from circumference and calf skin-fold, 6) triceps surae ACSA, 7) triceps surae PCSA, and (8) triceps surae volume (VOLm), in 39 premenopausal women (mean +/- SD: 36 +/- 8 yr, 165 +/- 6 cm, and 65 +/- 9 kg). RESULTS: Zero-order correlations showed significant (P < 0.05) associations between MVC and total body LM (r = 0.365), lower leg LM (r = 0.381), circumference (r = 0.584), estimated muscle+bone CSA (r = 0.447), ACSA (r = 0.733), PCSA (r = 0.715), and VOLm (r = 0.649). By using the Fisher Z-transformation, ACSA and PCSA correlated significantly higher with MVC (P < 0.05) than anthropometric and DEXA indices. Further, only ACSA and PCSA regressed to the origin, indicating the ability to predict MVC was greatest with these two measures. CONCLUSIONS: The MRI-determined muscle size indices, which were specific to the triceps surae, correlated with strength better than whole limb anthropometric and DEXA indices. In this group of women, both ACSA and PCSA appeared superior to VOLm for predicting strength. PCSA was not found to be more precise than ACSA. ACSA appears to provide adequate precision for estimating plantar flexor specific tension in vivo.",2000,Jul,Med Sci Sports Exerc,32,7,1307-13,,10.1097/00005768-200007000-00019,10912898,#2837,Bamman 2000,,Whole muscle; external force measured
In vivo physiological cross-sectional area and specific force are reduced in the gastrocnemius of elderly men.,Morse CI; Thom JM; Reeves ND; Birch KM; Narici MV,"Sarcopenia and muscle weakness are well-known consequences of aging. The aim of the present study was to ascertain whether a decrease in fascicle force (Ff) could be accounted for entirely by muscle atrophy. In vivo physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and specific force (Ff/PCSA) of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius (GL) muscle were assessed in a group of elderly men [EM, aged 73.8 yr (SD 3.5), height 173.4 cm (SD 4.4), weight 78.4 kg (SD 8.3); means (SD)] and for comparison in a group of young men [YM, aged 25.3 yr (SD 4.4), height 176.4 cm (SD 7.7), weight 79.1 kg (SD 11.9)]. GL muscle volume (Vol) and Achilles tendon moment arm length were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. Pennation angle and fiber fascicle length (Lf) were measured using B-mode ultrasonography during isometric maximum voluntary contraction of the plantar flexors. PCSA was estimated as Vol/Lf. GL Ff was calculated by dividing Achilles tendon force by the cosine of theta, during the interpolation of a supramaximal doublet, and accounting for antagonist activation level (assessed using EMG), Achilles tendon moment arm length, and the relative PCSA of the GL within the plantar flexor group. Voluntary activation of the plantar flexors was lower in the EM than in the YM (86 vs. 98%, respectively, P < 0.05). Compared with the YM, plantar flexor maximal voluntary contraction torque and Ff of the EM were lower by 47 and 40%, respectively (P < 0.01). Both Vol and PCSA were smaller in the EM by 28% (P < 0.01) and 16% (P < 0.05), respectively. Also, pennation angle was 12% smaller in the EM, whereas there was no significant difference in Lf between the YM and EM. After accounting for differences in agonists and antagonists activation, the Ff/PCSA of the EM was 30% lower than that of the YM (P < 0.01). These findings demonstrate that the loss of muscle strength with aging may be explained not only by a reduction in voluntary drive to the muscle, but mostly by a decrease in intrinsic muscle force.

"Normalized force, activation, and coactivation in the arm muscles of young and old men.",Klein CS; Rice CL; Marsh GD,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether the loss of muscle strength in the elderly could be explained entirely by a decline in the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of muscle. Isometric force, muscle activation (twitch interpolation), and coactivation (surface electromyograph) were measured during maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the elbow flexors (EFs) and extensors (EEs) in 20 young (23 +/- 3 yr) and 13 older (81 +/- 6 yr) healthy men. PCSA was determined using magnetic resonance imaging, and normalized force (NF) was calculated as the MVC/PCSA ratio. The PCSA was smaller in the old compared with the young men, more so in the EEs (28%) compared with the EFs (19%) (P < 0.001); however, the decline in MVC (approximately 30%) with age was similar in the two muscle groups. Muscle activation was not different between the groups, but coactivation was greater (5%) (P < 0.001) in the old men for both muscles. NF was less (11%) in the EFs (P < 0.01) and tended to be unchanged in the EEs of the old compared with young subjects. The relative maintenance of NF in the EEs compared with the EFs may be related to age-associated changes in the architecture of the triceps brachii muscle. In conclusion, although the decline in PCSA explained the majority of strength loss in the old men, additional factors such as greater coactivation or reduced specific tension also may have contributed to the age-related loss of isometric strength.",2001,Sep,J Appl Physiol (1985),91,3,1341-9,,10.1152/jappl.2001.91.3.1341,11509534,#2995,Klein 2001,,Whole muscle; external force measured
