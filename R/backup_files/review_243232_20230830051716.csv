four heads of the quadriceps muscles from transverse plane images at 25 mm intervals from the distal to the proximal ends of the quadriceps. These cross-sectional areas were summed and multiplied by the distance between slices (2.5 cm) to estimate quadriceps muscle volume",The fascicle length and pennation angle used in these calculations were estimated using real-time B-mode Ultrasonography with a 7.5-MHz linear array probe.

Voluntary activation was assessed using a version of the interpolated twitch technique (28,29) with stimulating electrodes covering the proximal and distal portions of the quadriceps

current increased to deliver supramaximal “doublet” (two 200-μs pulses separated by 10 ms) stimuli over the quadriceps muscle group. Stimulation was applied to the relaxed muscle 1  s prior to a maximal voluntary effort and then again at the highest point of the MVC. In the cross-sectional study, a third doublet was also applied 2 s after the MVC. The voluntary activation test was performed twice and the result giving the highest voluntary activation was accepted.","The patella tendon moment arm was imaged with the leg at full extension and estimated from sagittal plane slices as the distance from the mid-contact point between the femoral condyles and tibial plateau to the patella tendon. The moment arm length was multiplied by 0.99 to adjust for the difference between full knee extension to 90° flexion (24) [the angle at which maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured] and the resulting value was multiplied by 1.14 to adjust for the 14% increase in moment arm in transition from rest to MVC

The patella tendon force was estimated
from the moment equilibrium equation around the knee joint (27) by dividing the MVC torque by the patella tendon moment arm length.

For calculations of in situ specific force, the quadriceps PCSA was multiplied by the cosine of the fascicle pennation angle to account for the reduction in transmission of forces from fibers to aponeurosis to adjust for the angle between the fascicles and the line of pull through the patella tendon. Specific force was estimated as: [(external torque/moment arm)/(PCSA * pennation angle)] or simplified to: [Patella tendon force/(PCSA * pennation angle)

The external force used in the calculation of specific force was the “true MVC”, which is the estimated MVC if full voluntary activation was possible: True MVC = MVC immediately prior to the superimposed doublet/(1 – t/T).

To estimate GL muscle volume (VOL),ACSA of each slice was summed and multiplied by the slice thickness inclusive of gap
","Muscle architecture was recorded from participants dur-ing performance of PF MVC 
Fibre fascicle length (Lf) and pennation angle () were measured using B-Mode, real time ultrasonography
",PCSA (cm2) was calculated as the ratio of GL VOL(cm3) to Lf (cm).,"Isometric plantarflexion (PF) maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque was recorded with the subjects in a prone position and the left foot secured to the foot adapter of an isokinetic dynamometer

Two isometric maximal voluntary plantarflexion contractions (MVC) were performed at an ankle joint angle of -20° (the foot in dorsiflexion), 2 min separated each MVC attempt. The foot was placed at -20° as this has previously been shown to be the optimum fascicle length within the physiological range of the gastrocnemius muscle (Maganaris2003)

The sum of the torque generated during the strongest MVC and that of the twitch-doublet was considered at the true maximal MVC and used for the calculation ofspecific tension [as described previously by Fukunaga et al. (1996) and Maganaris et al. (2001)

The value of torque calculated with this method probably represents a peak MVC, and not the true maximal MVC as would have been obtained by adding a tetanus rather than doublet to the voluntary torque. However, considering that the delivery of a tetanic current is extremely painful and that the population involved older individuals, we opted to use a doublet instead.
Two maximal isometric dorsiflexion (DF) contractions were performed after the PF MVC to obtain maximal dorsiflexion electromyographic (EMG) data for calculation of antagonist co-activation in the tibialis anterior. PF and DF MVC attempts were held for approximately 4 s, a time amply sufficient to reach a torque plateau.

In order to obtain an estimation of specific force without the confounding variable of increased muscle activation resulting from training, supramaximal doublets were superimposed over the second plantarflexor MVC.

The plantarflexor torque used in the estimation of specific force was determined as: PF MVC torque +superimposed doublet torque, as described previously (Maganaris et al. 2001).

The co-activation torque produced by the dorsiflexors was estimated assuming a linear relation between torque and EMG activity. To determine isolated plantar flexor torque, the dorsiflexor coactivation torque was added to the net plantarflexor torque that was obtained during Plantarflexor MVC.
","In vivo MRI was performed to determine moment arm length of the achilles tendon at rest. A series of sagittal plane scans were taken of the left ankle with the foot secured at a right angle to the tibia (0°), at ¡ 20° dorsiflexion and 20° plantarflexion. Three scans were required to determine the centre of rotation of the talocrural joint from the method described previously (Rugg et al. 1990).

Achilles tendon force was calculated by dividing PF
torque by the achilles tendon moment arm length.

In order to estimate the contribution of the GL to achilles tendon force, the relative PCSA of the GL within the triceps surae was calculated


We have previously determined that the GL constitutes 11% of the triceps surae PCSA(Morse et al. 2005a), and the triceps surae group was estimated to represent 91% of the total PF PCSA in the elderly (Wickiewicz et al. 1983); hence this seems to justify the assumption that the triceps surae PCSA represents the main PCSA of the plantarflexors

Once the GL component of the achilles tendon force was calculated, this was divided by cos  to determine the fascicle force (Ff).

Specific force of the GL muscle was calculated by dividing GL Ff by GL PCSA.

In each section, the distance (d) between two muscle ACSAs (a and b) was 30 mm, except for the most distal section, which varied between 5 and 30 mm. All sections were treated as truncated cone

Volume of the entire VL muscle was calculated by summing up all of the inter-ACSA volumes",The VL muscle architecture was examined in vivo at the time of superimposed stimuli application using real-time B-mode ultrasonograph at MVC,"ACSA=B-mode ultrasonography using a7.5-MHz linear-array probe was used to obtain axial-plane images of the VL muscle

During all measurements, the subjects were instructed to relax their leg muscles. The proximal and distal insertions and the midsagittal plane of the VL muscle were identified and marked on the skin. Axial sections were then clearly marked along the muscle at intervals of 30 mm from the proximal insertion

The VL muscle PCSA was calculated by dividing muscle volume by fascicle length (1, 21, 30). This calculation assumes a muscle model that is cylindrical in shape, with fibers of constant length. The assumption of a relatively constant fiber length throughout the muscle is supported by previous in vivo and in vitro findings in several human muscles (13, 29, 31, 34)","Maximal isometric knee extension and flexion torque were assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer at nine knee joint angles, ranging from 90 to 10°, in 10° increments (full extension 0°), with the hip angle at 85° (supine position 0°)
When the voluntary torque peaked, a superimposed supramaximal double twitch with 50- s pulse width and 50-ms inter stimulus gap was applied. The doublet was generated by an electrical stimulator
The point at which a further increase in current by 50 mA failed to increase the twitch torque was defined as the supramaximal stimulation intensity. The voluntary activation capacity of the quadriceps muscle group was calculated as maximum voluntary torque/(maximum voluntary torque + superimposed stimulation torque),

EMG activity was assessed from the  vastus lateralis (VL) muscle and the long head of the biceps femoris (BF) muscle.
The root mean square (RMS) EMG activity of the BF and VL muscles was measured over a 50-ms time period corresponding to maximal isometric knee extension torque

To estimate the level of antagonistic co contraction from the knee flexors, the BF muscle RMS EMG activity was measured during maximal isometric knee flexion

The antagonistic torque of the knee flexors during a maximal isometric knee extension was calculated, assuming a linear EMG-torque relation, from the EMG-torque relation of the BF muscle when acting as an agonist

","Patella tendon moment arm lengths were assessed using a 0.2-T MRI scanner

it was only possible to image the knee joint in full extension. The previously reported ratio (2) of the patella tendon moment arm length between full extension and the specific knee joint angle studied was used to estimate the tendon moment arm length for each subject.


 patella tendon force=The sum of the maximal knee extension joint torque (maximalvoluntary torque + superimposed stimulation torque) and the esti-mated antagonistic cocontraction torque from the knee flexors (TQcoac) was divided by the MRI-based estimate of the patella tendon moment arm length (MAPT)
Fpt=(T_KE +T_coac)/MA

The relative contribution of the VL muscle to the patella tendon force calculated was estimated from the relative PCSA of the VL muscle with respect to the entire quadriceps muscle group,from the data of Narici et al. (36).

The VL muscle fascicle force was estimated by dividing VL
muscle force by the cosine of the angle of pennation of fascicles,
measured during maximal isometric contraction

F_fasc=F_VL/cos(alpha)


Specific force of the VL muscle was calculated at the knee joint angle where maximal fascicle force peaked (calculated from the maximal voluntary torque + superimposed stimulation torque).

Training resulted in a 19% increase in specific force, from 27 to 32 N/cm2.Specific force values obtained in the present study are in line with previous reports of 15–38 N/cm2 obtained in human muscle (21, 30, 36) and 15–29 N/cm2 obtained in animal muscle (9, 39, 45). It should be stressed that, in contrast to single-fiber experiments where activation remains at a given level (47, 48), changes in activation level might occur when contractions are performed with voluntary effort, and this should be accounted for in the estimation of specific force. If specific force had been calculated from the voluntary torque only, the post training increase observed would partly reflect differences in the activation level found. However, this problem was largely avoided in the present study because, in both pre- and post training conditions, the calculation of specific force encompassed parameters measured at the time of supra-maximal electrical stimuli superimposed on the voluntary effort. Artificial maximal activation of the entire muscle would entirely eliminate this problem, but this would require supra-maximal tetanic stimulation through the femoral nerve, a procedure that may cause considerable discomfort, raising ethical considerations for its use with elderly populations."

In total, four scans were performed along the length of the GL, consisting of seven contiguous axial slices (slice thick-ness 8 mm; gap 2 mm)

ACSA (excluding visible fat and connective tissue) was then multiplied by the slice thickness (inclusive of gap) to give an estimate of muscle volume(Vol).","The participants laid prone, with the foot secured at -20° dorsiflexion. Fiber fascicle length (Lf) and pennation angle (alpha) were measured using B-Mode, real-time ultrasonography during MVC",PCSA (cm2) was calculated as the ratio of GL Vol (cm3) to Lf (cm).,"Isometric plantarflexor MVC torque was recorded with the participants laying prone and the left foot secured to the foot adapter of an isokinetic dynamometer

Two isometric maximal voluntary plantarflexions (MVC) were performed at an ankle joint angle of -20° (the foot in dorsiflexion); 2 min separated each MVC attempt. The foot was placed at -20° as this has been shown previously to correspond to the optimum fascicle length within the physiological range of the gastrocnemius muscle

Maximal isometric dorsiflexions were performed after the plantarflexion MVC to obtain maximal dorsiflexor electromyographic (EMG) data for calculation of antagonist coactivation in the tibialis anterior

EMG activity of the tibialis anterior was recordedwhile performing maximal isometric plantarflexions and dorsiflexions 
The level of coactivation of the tibialis anterior was assessed using the root mean square (RMS) of the raw EMG signal, which was integrated over 1 s about the peak MVC torque during PF; this was then expressed as the percentage EMG activity recorded from the tibialis anterior during maximal dorsiflexion
Torque produced by the dorsiflexors during plantarflexion was estimated assuming a linear relation between torque and EMG activity, which has previously been reported from the tibialis anterior muscle (29). To obtain an estimate of plantarflexion peak torque, dorsiflexion torque during plantarflexion was added to the net MVC plantarflexion torque.
","Moment arm length. MRI was used to determine moment arm length of the Achilles tendon at rest. Two sagittal plane scans were taken of the left ankle with the foot secured at  20° dorsiflexion and20° plantarflexion. From these images an average moment arm length between the two angles of measurement was calculated according to the tendon excursion method described previously. 
The moment arm length (MA) was estimated as MA (m) tibial angle (rad)/calcaneal displacement (m).


Tendon force was calculated by dividing the net plantarflexion torque (N m) by the Achilles tendon moment arm length (m).

GL fascicle force. To estimate the contribution of the GL to Achilles tendon force, the relative PCSA of the GL within the triceps surae was calculate

We have determined previously that the GL constitutes 11% of the triceps surae PCSA(33), and the triceps surae group was estimated to occupy 91% of the plantarflexor PCSA

","Muscle length was the distance between the most proximal and the most distal images in which the muscle was visible.

Muscle fiber length was estimated by multiplying muscle length (from MRI) by the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio determined in cadavers (38). The ratios used were 0.60, 0.49, 0.68, and 0.33 for the biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis, and triceps brachii, respectively (38).

It was assumed that the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio was the same in the young and old men

No data are available for the fiber length-to-muscle length ratio in the anconeus, so it was assumed to be the same as the biceps brachii because the fibers run parallel in both muscles

","The PCSA was calculated by dividing muscle volume by the estimated fiber (fascicle) length

The PCSA of the triceps brachii was multiplied by the cosine of the fiber pennation angle, assumed to be 15° for both groups, whereas the EFs were assumed to have no pennation",,"MVC recorded.

A modified twitch interpolation technique was used to assess the level of muscle activation during the MVC

Coactivation during the MVC was determined by recording the EMG activity over the antagonist muscle(s)

","The biceps brachii, brachialis, and brachioradialis muscles were traced in each image and together made up the (Elbow Flexors)  EFs. The triceps brachii and anconeus were traced and together made up the (Elbow Extensors) EEs. The pronator teres and the extensor carpi radialis longus muscles, which together generate 15% of EF torque (38), were not included in the EF volume because they were not clearly visible in the imagesover their entire length. The brachioradialis, extensor carpiradialis longus, and brevis muscles were traced as a group
The brachioradialis volume was then estimated to be 39% ofthe combined volume of these three muscles (4). The length of the brachioradialis, however, could be determined because the origin and insertion regions were clearly evident in all images. The coracobrachialis muscle was traced as part of the biceps brachii because these two muscles could not be sepa-rated convincingly throughout their entire length. In bothyoung and old cadavers, the coracobrachialis is 23% of the weight of the biceps brachii plus the coracobrachialis (47).

A proton density echo protocol (repetition time 4140 ms, echo time 7.5 ms, field of view 512 × 512 mm, slice thickness 4 mm, gap between slices 0.0 mm) was used to continuously scan the thighs from the superior border of the patella to the greater trochanter.

subsequently, the VL muscle volume was calculated as follows: VL_volume (cm3) = ∑ ACSA × slice thickness","Vastus lateralis muscle architecture was assessed at rest using B-mode ultrasound imaging
Longitudinal images were taken from the mid-belly of the VL muscle, corresponding to 39% of the distance from the proximal edge of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine

For the measurements, the subjects were seated on the dynamometer chair, with the knees flexed at 10° as measured by a goniometer (0° corresponding to full extension of the knee), the legs supported and the muscles relaxed. This knee bend was selected because it does not cause excessive stretch of the hamstrings in a seated position (Reeves et al. 2009) and helps to reduce the fascicle curvature, improving measurement reliability

Both FL and PA were measured during MVCs at the same site used for muscle architecture measurements",PCSA was calculated by dividing the muscle volume by the optimum FL (measured at optimal angle during MVC).,"Subjects were seated on the dynamometer chair and firmly strapped at the hip, at the chest and over the thigh to minimize extraneous movement. The knee center of rotation was carefully aligned with the dynamometer axis of rotation, and the lever arm of the dynamometer was firmly attached to the lower leg with inextensible straps

Antagonist muscle coactivation was estimated by determining the electromyographic activity of the biceps femoris (BF) muscle during each MVC.

The interpolated twitch technique was used to determine the level of maximal voluntary agonist muscle activation at 90° of knee flexion, as described previously (Erskine et al. 2009). This level of activation was applied to the peak extension torque obtained on each MVC, which, when corrected for antagonist muscle coactivation, provided the relative joint maximal torque (RJMT).

The joint angle at which the highest RJMT occurred was considered the optimal knee joint angle (optimal angle) and all subsequent calculations were made at this angle","to calculate the quadriceps forces at the patellar tendon, the highest RJMT was divided by the patellar tendon moment arm (ⅆPT), which was estimated at the peak torque of the MVCs

ⅆPT was determined from sagittal and coronal-plane knee scans obtained with an MRI scanner. The knee was scanned at rest with the participant in the supine position and the joint fully extended. Corrections were made for the difference between ⅆPT at full extension and at the optimal angle (Baltzopoulos 1995) and between rest and MVC (Tsaopoulos et al. 2006), providing the maximal quadriceps force.

The relative contribution of the VL muscle to the maximal quadriceps force was estimated from its relative PCSA with respect to the entire quadriceps muscle group

The force transmitted from the VL fascicle to the tendon was then estimated by dividing the VL muscle force by the cosine of the PA measured during MVC.

To our knowledge, such a result has not been reported previously. Although increases in specific tension after high-intensity resistance training have been reported previously (Erskine et al. 2010; Reeves et al. 2004), this is the first study report-ing differential adaptations to full vs. partial ROM. As PART ROM training-induced changes in the VL PCSA (7.8%) and fascicle force (20.2%), the VL specific tension remained unchanged in the PART group. Conversely, because FULL training increased both the FL and muscle volume (4.9 and 7.6% increase, respectively), the PCSA remained unchanged in the FULL group. Consequently, FULL training induced an increase in the VL specific tension (i.e., maximum muscle force per PCSA), as a result of a disproportionate increase in the fascicle force relative to the PCSA (29.7 and 2.5% increase, respectively). This discrepancy between the increase in muscle strength and size often reported follow-ing resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010) is commonly explained by the neural adaptations being greater than the muscle hypertrophy (Staron et al. 1994). However, the voluntary quadriceps muscle activation in the FULL group increased only 1.8% (nonsignificant, Table 4), which is quite similar to previous reports of increased muscle activa-tion after resistance training (Erskine et al. 2010; Reeves et al. 2004). Furthermore, although there was a trend toward decreases, there was no significant change in the level of antagonist muscle coactivation following training (− 16%, without statistical significance, Table 4). Therefore, correct-ing MVC for voluntary muscle activation, antagonist muscle coactivation and ⅆPT (which remained unchanged after train-ing) gave a 27.8% increase in the maximal quadriceps force (Table 4), thus demonstrating that training-induced changes in voluntary activation, coactivation and ⅆPT contributed little (4.2%) to the increase in MVC torque. Although we cannot deduce the source for the VL specific tension increase in the FULL group from the present results, some explanations have been presented as being able to cause the change in whole-muscle specific tension (Erskine et al. 2010). Among the factors that may explain this phenomenon are the increase in the number of thick myofilaments per unit area (packing density) (Pansarasa et al. 2009), a change in muscle fiber-type composition and/or preferential muscle fiber hypertrophy of type II fibers (Campos et al. 2002), and/or a possible change in the quality of attachment between the contractile muscle fibers and the surrounding connective tis-sue through which force is transmitted to tendons and bones (Erskine et al. 2010)"

By summing the ACSA of the muscle along its length and then multiplying the sum by the interval of 0.01 m, muscle volume (Vmu) was determine","From MRI, Muscle length (lmu) was defined as the distance between the most proximal and the most distal images in which the muscle was visible. 

The pennation angles were obtained from human cadavers (Amis et al. 1979). The If was determined from lmu multiplied by lf/lmu which was derived from the previous study (Edgerton et al. 1986), i.e
lf:lmu ratio from cadavers","From the photographed cross-section MRI of the upper extremity, outlines of main elbow flexor muscles [biceps brachii (BIC), brachialis (BRA), brachioradialis (BRD)] and elbow extensor muscles [triceps brachii (TRI); Bo et al. 1980] were digitized and anatomical CSA (ACSA) of each muscle were 
calculated

The PCSA of elbow flexor and extensor muscles were obtained from the following equations: 
For elbow flexor muscles: PCSA = Vmu/lf 
For elbow extensor muscles: PCSA = Vmu/lf * cos(alpha) 
where If and alpha are muscle fibre length and fibre pennation angle, respectively","Maximal voluntary isometric, concentric,

Isometric torque was measured three times each at elbow joint angles 0.873, 1.222, 1.571, and 1.920 rad (full extension corresponds to zero), and the maximal value was adopted. The maximal torque was observed at 1.571 rad for flexion and at 1.222 rad for extension. Concentric and eccentric torque was defined as the torque at the specific joint angle (flexion, 1.571 rad; extension, 1.222 rad) at which the maximal isometric torque was observed. Velocities during concentric and eccentric muscle actions were 0.524, 1.571, 
and 3.142 rad.s-1. ","Moment arms of B1C, BRA, BRD, and TRI were measured using MRI. Sagittal slices of 0.005-m thickness were obtained for the upper extremity of the dominant side at intervals of 0.005 m and interspaced gaps of 0 m.
The elbow joint angle was kept at 1.571 rad. Procedures were similar to those of Rugg et aI. (1990) and Spoor and van Leeuwen

the SNMES. Following each protocol, images were immediately (3 § 0.2 min) collected again

Fourteen to 18 slices for each subject were analyzed beginning with the first proximal slice visualizing the four heads of the mQF group and continued distally until the slice just before the top of the patella. 

Muscle volume (cm3) was calculated by multiplying the activated CSA (cm2) in each
slice * 2 cm (slice thickness + interslice space). The slices
were then added together to calculate the volume of acti-
vated tissue","Vastus lateralis muscle can be used as surrogate of mQF (Trappe et al. 2001; Reeves et al. 2004). Fiber length was identifed by the following equation after measuring muscle length (fiber length/ muscle length = 0.23) Wickiewicz et al. 1983).

pennation angle of 15.6° was acquired from previously published data, which is the pennation angle of m. vastus lateralis at 60° of knee joint below horizontal during isometric contraction (Fukunaga et al. 1997; Ichinose et al. 1997)


Muscle length was measured as the distance between the most proximal and the most distal points in which the muscle was visible in three scout views captured with MRI (Fukunaga et al. 1992; Narici et al. 1992). Adjustments were made to account for Wber length during isometric actions at diVerent percentages of MVIT (Ichinose et al. 1997). The resting length was multiplied
by the percentage changes in fiber length when torque was 75, 30, 60, and 45% of MVIT for RES, PD, FREQ,
and AMP, 

",The PCSA of mQF was calculated as follows. PCSA = [muscle volume * COS (pennation angle)]/fiber length,"maximum voluntary isometric torque (MVIT) on each thigh and the highest torque was considered his/her MVIT
The subject sat on a custom-built chair, and the leg was strapped at knee joint angle of 60° below horizontal to a rigid lever arm with an inelastic strap to ensure that the knee extensors could perform only isometric actions he lever arm was established by mounting a load cell perpendicular to and 12 in. (33 cm) from the axis of rotation of the lever arm."," All force measures were gravity compensated

torque/ patella moment arm derived from cadavers

The moment arm was derived from cadavers and knee joints of able bodies, 0.04 m, at the same knee joint angle used in our study (Baltzopoulos 1995; Wickiewicz et al. 1983, 1984). Because the moment arm increases with muscle contraction and moment arm from cadavers shrinks after death, the percentage increase in the moment arm during ankle extension, 18%, was used in the calculation of the moment arm length for this lower extremity, extensor muscle group (Maganaris et al. 2001). A moment arm length of 0.047 m was used to correct torque to force","Four protocols of electrical stimulation were randomly delivered to both quadriceps femoris muscle (mQF)


All stimulation protocols were performed on one day.
SNMES was applied to the mQF via surface electrodes
to induce intermittent, isometric actions.

These protocols were: (1)

From these images, the cross-sectional areas of individual muscles were measured in scans at 18.9 mm intervals. The volume of each muscle head was calculated as the sum of the cross-sectional area in all scans multiplied by the distance between each measured slice (1.89 cm)
","At the joint angle that corresponded to the greatest estimated Fquad, additional MVCs were performed during which ultrasound recordings were made of the VL, VI, VM and RF muscles. The recordings were taken from the mid-belly of each muscle, which, in the case of VL, VM and RF, was at 39, 22 and 56% of the distance from the proximal edge of the patella to the anterior superior iliac spine, respectively.

For the VI muscle, the mean of the fascicle architecture from the anterior and lateral portion was used to describe the architecture of the whole muscle.","PCSA is

fascicle length","Participants were seated and securely strapped on the seat of an isokinetic dynamometer

The level of antagonistic co-activation during the knee extension MVC was estimated from the moment–electromyogram (EMG) relationship of the knee flexor muscles. At each joint angle, participants also performed isometric knee flexions at 10, 20, 50, 70 and 100% of MVC, during which the surface EMG from the biceps femoris muscle was recorded through two

The EMG of the biceps femoris during the knee extensions was then compared with the knee flexion moment–EMG relationship to determine the corresponding joint moment that this muscle would produce as an antagonist

The level of voluntary activation was quantified from superimposed and resting doublets using the interpolated twitch technique

Percentage activation = [1 − (superimposed doublet moment/resting doublet moment)] × 100

The MVC moment produced by the quadriceps (QuadMVC) was estimated as the sum of the measured joint moment (JointMVC) and the calculated antagonist moment.

The calculated Quad100% was then used to calculate peak patellar tendon force (F pt) during a fully activated effort by dividing Quad100% by the PTMA

Finally, the Fquad was calculated from the F pt using the ratios provided by Buff et al. (1988), which account for the fact that the patella is not a frictionless pulley for transmitting force from the quadriceps to the tibia.

Specific tension = (tendon force × cos θ−1)/PCSA

The PCSA × cos θ of the entire quadriceps was therefore calculated as the sum of the PCSA × cos θ of each quadriceps head. The Fquad was then divided by the quadriceps PCSA × cos θ to determine the specific tension of the entire quadriceps muscle.","The ITT is susceptible to errors resulting from changes in series elastic stiffness between joint angles, which makes it an unsuitable means of quantifying activation level across a range of joint angles (Bampouras et al. 2006). However, recent experiments in adults and children indicate that the level of knee extensor muscle activation does not differ across knee joint angles and that the ITT outcome at 90 deg knee flexion is a realistic estimate of voluntary activation for the quadriceps muscle across all knee joint angles (O’Brien et al. 2009b)


By incorporating the size and architecture measurements of all four quadriceps heads in the calculation of a specific tension for the entire quadriceps muscle, the errors associated with distributing the tendon force between the separate heads was minimized

However, Chow et al. (1999) acknowledgedthat they had underestimated specific tension because of inaccurate estimates of fascicle pennation, failure to account for antagonist activation and the use of mean muscle force across a number of trials rather than maximal muscle force. Narici et al. (1992) and Reeves et al. (2004)did not account for the force that is lost in the transmission of quadriceps force through the patella to the tibia (Buffet al. 1988), and used F pt to calculate specific tension rather than Fquad. At the mean knee angle of 65 deg,this loss of force is equal to a third of Fquad. If the specific tension calculated in the present study had been calculated from the F pt, rather than Fquad, this would have resulted in estimates of ∼37 N cm−2, which are much closer to those previously reported. Additionally, in thepresent study F pt was calculated from PTMA lengthsmeasured at rest, which are smaller than those during contraction (Tsaopoulos et al. 2007). Had PTMA lengths during contraction been used, according to the findings of Tsaopoulos et al. (2007), the specific tension in the men would have been ∼34 N cm−2.

The specific tension values obtained in the present study are also much higher than those reported by Maganaris et al.(2001; 15 N cm−2).Such a large difference is most probably due to the fact that specific tension in that study was underestimated because muscle forces were not maximal, since the muscles studied were activated by percutaneous electrical stimulation, which is unlikely to recruit the whole muscle"
